<!--- Unit and sequence information. This template is an instructor-facing description for a given activity or lab. --->


We can sketch out the data science process as follows:
1. Define the problem.
2. Obtain the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.

We'll walk through a full data science problem in this lab. Specifically, we'll use a survey of psychological factors to predict whether or not individuals are left-handed. Along the way, we'll compare multiple classification models and see which best serve our needs.

## Materials We Provide
<!--- This section is a table of contents for the activity. The table structure breaks down repo resources into types, distinguishing between  notebooks and supporting materials. Note that the table below demonstrates the total possible range of materials; most lessons won't require all of the categories below. Also note that every item in the repo should get its own line and link, like the example shown for data. --->
