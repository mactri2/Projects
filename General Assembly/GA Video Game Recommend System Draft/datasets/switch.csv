Take control of Toki Tori, a surprisingly heroic chicken, as he puzzles his way through 80+ levels spread over five unique worlds. 
 
Toki Tori isn’t very athletic, he can’t even jump! Luckily he has some great tools at his disposal, including the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock™. 
 
Creative thinking and problem solving are required to collect all eggs in each level, but don’t worry! When you get stuck, you can always rewind time. And if all else fails, use the Wildcard to skip a level. 
 
Toki Tori for Nintendo Switch is the most detailed portable version of the game so far. 
 
Toki Tori 2+ 
 
Explore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles. 
 
Toki Tori 2+’s ingenious game design requires just two moves: whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to incredible complexity later on. 
 
There’s a tonne to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you can still find hundreds of golden wings, snap dozens of creature pictures and go Achievement hunting. 
 
Toki Tori 2+ is better than ever on Nintendo Switch, with lots of gameplay tweaks and even some new secrets and puzzle solutions. Plus, you can now create checkpoints wherever you like, allowing for easy experimentation. 
 
Each purchase includes the following items: 
- Fully assembled Nintendo Switch game with cartridge

Remember when looking at your friends’ screen in Goldeneye was frowned upon? Well those days are gone and in Screencheat, we encourage it! Screencheat is a chaotic split-screen multiplayer shooter that forces players to rethink the way they approach conventional multiplayer games. In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks. Screencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone’s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?","[1, 40, 268435461]","[1, 40]",,,,1551052800,https://www.igdb.com/games/screencheat-unplugged,8816.0,Unplugged,[23357],[94679]

More portable than ever, the new Nintendo Switch™ Edition of this best-selling city builder comes complete with reworked UI, designed especially for Switch, along with two of Cities: Skylines’ most popular expansions - After Dark and Snowfall. 
 
Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements like education, healthcare and much more along with your city’s real economy system. Citizens in your city react fluidly, with gravitas and an air of authenticity to a multitude of gameplay scenarios. 
 
Nintendo Switch edition exclusive: Using HD Rumble, a rumble effect helps find the most efficient area to place service buildings in your city. Pro controllers are also supported, and additional tutorials help guide your first playthrough for a better learning experience. 
 
Extensive local traffic simulation: Colossal Order's extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is put to work in fully fleshed out, well-crafted transport systems. 
 
Districts and Policies: Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city. 
 
After Dark: Focused on leisure and tourist specialization, this expansion's central feature is to utilize the day and night cycle and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? 
 
Snowfall: The difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to this expansion's added challenges and assets, like snow maps, streetcars, and heating systems.

Standard Sudoku: 
 
Sudoku (数独 sūdoku, digit-single) - is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called ""boxes"", ""blocks"", or ""regions"") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
 
Jigsaw Sudoku: 
 
The rules of Jigsaw Sudoku are similar to standard Sudoku since you must place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to whatever the size of the puzzle is) into each of the rows and columns. However, whereas standard Sudoku also has rectangular boxes that must each contain every number, in Jigsaw Sudoku these boxes are replaced by different bold-lined shapes that must each contain every number instead. © 
 
Killer Sudoku: 
 
Killer Sudoku puzzles include all the rules of regular Sudoku but add in dashed-line 'cages' which must sum to given values. Killer Sudoku is also sometimes known as Sumdoku, Mathdoku or Addoku. The name 'Killer' Sudoku arises because of the wicked twist on the standard Sudoku puzzle, since you must not only place each of the numbers 1 to 9 (or 1 to the size of the puzzle) into each of the rows, columns, and bold-lined 3x3 (or other sizes) boxes but you must also place the numbers into each dashed-line cage so that they add up to its given total - and without repeating a digit in a dashed-line cage.","[268435465, 268435471, 536873156]",,,,,1582675200,https://www.igdb.com/games/sudoku-universe--1,,,[29883],[116542]
