dating_advice,xpost from relationship advice...GF posting screenshots of chat with other Dom in secret IG while we're together. Better explanation in actual post.," 

Thanks in advance!

The situation is a little less black and white than the title would suggest, struggled to summarize. I'll attempt to do so and keep this short.

Girlfriend and I have been together since August 2018. We've been living together since early summer 2019.

We are involved in a D/s relationship (not fully lifestyle, but close to it) I am Dominant and she is submissive.

Around February 2019, she told me she had a second IG account as a sort of kink journal. She wouldn't let me have the username because she said it was sort of embarrassing/private, but did share some of the posts by reading them to me. According to her, it was basically all about us as a couple.

A short time after that, she then showed me a post, but failed to hide the username completely. Not sure if it was a slip or if she simply didn't think I'd be quick enough to see it and read it. Years of gaming made me ready!

We've had some jealousy and loyalty issues, they're on me for the most part, some inappropriate messages to some friends. Nothing explicit of any kind, just some light but obviously flirting. She discovered this by looking through my phone. We've been moved past it for some time though. I'm not sure that this is relevant to my problem, but I wanted to include the history so that I could get a bit of a sanity check in case Im projecting onto her.

Now, to the actual issue.

Back in November, for no reason I can think of, I decided to google her username from the site where we met. And I came across a relatively new account on a pic/vid selling site. We discussed, and I decided that I would let it go since, according to the site and her, she never sold anything.

That got me a little on edge, because I remembered asking her where she was posting a pic while we were sitting next to eachother (it wasn't a nude but it was close) and she told me she had sent it to one of her female friends. I had seen enough of the screen to know it was a lie, but I didn't know for certain until I saw the same pic there. Anyway...

The posts on her ""secret"" IG journal. When I found that account, I couldn't help myself and searched for her other IG to see what else I would find. As she said, it was almost entirely directly related to her and I, and it was anonymous. What I did notice, though, were two posts, screenshots of texts. These were among the first things on the account (added in Dec 2018, along with posts that were definitely me/about me)

These two screenshots were not familiar to me. I don't think I was the person she was talking to. They used phrases I don't use and sort of actively don't like so I would never. Nothing extremely identifying, but pretty clearly not me.

I didn't think much of it, until about 2 days ago when she mentioned getting X number of likes on her post, which was on that account. We got back around to the topic and she mentioned again that it was all stuff about me/us. I asked a couple of times ""confirming"" the same without giving away that I was aware of the content. She read a few posts from the December 2018 ""era"" but not the suspicious ones.

Now today, because it was kind of bugging me, I went to re-read them and see if I could shake up some memory. And they're gone. She's removed those specific two posts. That pretty well solidifies it to me that I wasn't just forgetting them.

So, my questions...

1. Should I bother saying anything? It's from over a year ago.
2. What's your gut telling you guys, reading it? It's about 4 months after we got together. Is this a case of enjoying the way those specific messages came across, or were these fresh and she was engaging with someone else in an intimate manner while we were together?
3. Would you be upset/upset enough to bring it up even if they were from an old relationship but she posted them anyway?
4. Do you think it's better or worse that she's removed them now? As far as Im aware, she doesn't know I know the acct.

I'm completely comfortable talking to her about it, and plan to, but I want a sanity check first. There are a number of oddball things throughout the relationship that make me think this is not super innocent. I can provide more detail, but to give an example, taking pics/nudes ""for herself"" or to send to me later. I've discovered those by seeing the album while she shows me other pics.

Happy to answer with whatever details I can provide further."
dating_advice,Should I keep trying but take things slower or is it over?,"Met this girl. We went out 6-7 times over the course of a month and a half or so, and things were going really good. After the last time we went out I texted her what she was thinking about us. Bad move I know now. She wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond, but she said she‚Äôs enjoyed every time we hung out and liked that. But it scared her off I think and she started acting different. Went on for about two weeks. We kept texting although not much and short replies, and I definitely reciprocated the shortness so that probably didn‚Äôt help. I was frustrated. I tried to get together a couple times, but couldn‚Äôt get anything to work. And last week contact stopped for a couple days and I texted her asking what‚Äôs goin on, and if I did or said something she didn‚Äôt like. Told her I had been feeling weird over the last couple weeks and felt like she was blowing me off. 

She sent me back this ‚ÄúI understand what you‚Äôre saying. You didn‚Äôt say anything wrong or stupid at all. I kinda got weird when you asked me what I thought about us. You had every right to ask that and I‚Äôm kinda glad you did but I‚Äôm weird and idk what happened after that but I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to do whatever this is right now.‚Äù

I really like this girl I think and I had no intentions of defining the relationship or taking things any further or serious when I asked her about us. I just wanted to know if she liked me lol. Anyways, I responded to that telling her I understand, and some other stuff that probably didn‚Äôt help, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I feel like I should just move on. It‚Äôs been a week, and I‚Äôm still thinking about her a lot. 

Should I just move on or should I keep trying to make something work? Should I send her a text? I know she‚Äôs got something going on this weekend she‚Äôs competing in. Would it be bad to text her good luck?"
dating_advice,How do I get a date for Valentine's/prom in later months?,"I'm 17m and have been pretty lonely since my ex and I broke up last April. I want to get with someone and have a valentine and hopefully a date for prom, but I've never had an irl relationship and I'm honestly lost. 

I've had long distance relationships before and Im sure if I tried I could get into another one, but I really don't want to. I want to have a girlfriend in person. 

But my problems are that I'm sorta chubby so not the most attractive, and a theatre kid, so I feel a lot of girls think that I'm gay. Not only that I'm the leader of my school's local GSA chapter aka ""the gay club"" around other students.

I don't think I'm hopeless but I'm lost about how to meet someone who won't have these predispositions about me, and to get her interested in me enough to go on a date.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice!!"
dating_advice,Rejected the worst way possible,"I (M23)was dating a female (F21)or 3 years when I decided to ask her to marry me!   I asked her and her response was ""not right now"" she moved out of our apartment back to her parents house. 
I was humiliated and shocked! It crushed my soul so much that I didn't want to sleep, eat, be around anyone. 
It's been 9 months and I saw her for the first time the other day shopping. I didn't know what to say? I miss you was the first thing I wanted to say but I was so hurt I couldn't even put words together to formulate a sentence. 
This is my first heartbreak and how long will this last? Any advice on how to get over someone that rejected your proposal?"

Playing it cool was a defense mechanism that kept me contributing in a conversation and kept the dates coming back, but I obviously can't meet anyone nice that way. 

Im not sure why I'm this way and come off as mean or bratty, any suggestions on why or how to be yourself on dates?"
dating_advice,Am I being crazy/dramatic?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years. We‚Äôve always been intolerably in love with each other (ie; mushy, over the top in love). In the past 3-6 months we‚Äôve hit a bit of a plateau, we spend most days texting constantly, we hang out every day pretty much with only each other (lost most if not all of our friendships and relationships by being that annoying couple that has to be together every second) and just lay in bed most nights and watch Hulu. 
     We still love each other, we can still laugh and we go places sometimes and it‚Äôs not horrible at all if I‚Äôm making it sound that way. He‚Äôs sweet, always compliments me, says he loves me, buys me snacks, and he‚Äôs awesome. He is my best (and only really) friend. I love him, but lately I look at him and it‚Äôs just not enough to fulfill all of my relationship needs, naturally. I need a friend group and other outlets and so does he and I really want to work on that and we‚Äôre trying to because that‚Äôs not a healthy relationship at all. Trying to express this to him instead of him understanding even when I assure him ‚ÄúI still love you, I still want to be with you‚Äù, he‚Äôs been very much like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm never enough for you, I don‚Äôt know how much more I can give‚Äù. When I bring up stuff like us never going out anymore, or kissing or touching as much, or asking him if he still loves me as much as he use to he is defensive and always like ‚Äúof course I love you the same I don‚Äôt know what else I can do to prove it to you‚Äù but lately things just feel off! I don‚Äôt know what it is!! 
     Compliments are said but they feel empty, plans for the future are made but they feel unsure for the first time. For example heres a backstory of our most recent ‚Äúfight‚Äù: He‚Äôs planning on going to another state in a year or two to go to school for something. We‚Äôre planning on moving in together soon (were 21 and have been together since high school) and so I always assumed when he went to school, I‚Äôd go with him. Right? I‚Äôve been dating this man for almost 5 years and we‚Äôll be living together and 23... is it not natural to think I‚Äôd go? This past weekend we were talking about his school because I‚Äôve been wanting to start making a more solid plan like what state he wants to go to, picking schools to apply to, thinking about where we‚Äôd live and get jobs and how our living situation would work. His response was something along the lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll visit so much and I‚Äôll send you money for your apartment if you need help don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll take care of you‚Äù and then I was like..... backtrack a second. ‚ÄúWait do you think I‚Äôm staying here and you‚Äôre going? I always thought I would go with you‚Äù *cue me panicking because I‚Äôve been thinking I‚Äôm starting a life with him and he‚Äôs thinking he‚Äôs leaving for school for 1-3 years and visiting me*. When I tell you I had to hold back tears....... y‚Äôall. Ouch. He changed his tune really quick like ‚Äúoh yeah, you could come! No don‚Äôt worry babe we could figure that out‚Äù.... double ouch. 
     Lately he feels just, distant a little bit, bored. Is this what growing apart is? Should I bring it up again and just ask if there‚Äôs anything wrong? Am I being dramatic? What do I do at this point? I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do if we break up because I can‚Äôt afford to live on my own and I left school for him and moved home and I just feel like maybe that was a huge mistake and I‚Äôm ruining my life but also I feel like maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic and nothing is happening and he still loves me and I‚Äôm just being crazy. Do you think I‚Äôm just being dramatic or should I trust my gut feeling?? It feels like my world is crashing but everything looks normal on the surface so I have no proof but I‚Äôm losing my mind, HELP ME!! I‚Äôm sorry for my horrible grammar and explaining but I‚Äôm stressed out. Should I text and ask him about it or no and just try to act normal? The thing is I‚Äôve been really on edge too like glancing at his phone when he‚Äôs on it messaging someone (which I don‚Äôt do). We were never like this ever! This is so recent and confusing."
dating_advice,Time waster or....,"I‚Äôve had a bit of a dry spell the past 2 months in terms of dates , mainly because I‚Äôm quite picky on dating apps.

This week I matched with this girl and we had quite a bit in common &amp; she was definitely attractive. conversation was flowing etc so I asked her out and she was keen so we set it up for the following day. Tomorrow rolls around and I messaged her in the morning to make sure we were still on , which we were. It was getting closer and I got home &amp; organised a ride in to town so I could drink etc. then she starts saying she‚Äôs still at work , not messaging back etc so I feel a bit embarrassed or slightly humiliated having organised a ride from my friend who knew what it was for and it not happening. 

She messaged me like a couple hours later asking if I was busy the following night (tonight) and I replied yeah I kind of am , which I actually am I have a party to go to.
at the moment I‚Äôve just left her on read because I am thinking it‚Äôs just a waste of time , or am I just being stupid because of the embarrassment/humiliation I felt last night ?"
dating_advice,Just figured that Im having a fling(F22) with someone who is emotionally unavailable and admits to it (M23). Thoughts?,[removed]
dating_advice,Is she [28/F] interested in me [30/M] or is it wishful thinking?,"I've had this friend since 2014. I had a thing for her in the beginning, but it faded as time passed but I'm still interested. She'd drop (possible) subtle hints here and there but no smoking gun that she liked me back.

Anyway, I built a website for her business. She hit me up out of the blue saying she wanted to talk about some edits she wants done on her site and wanted to meet up today. And to meet her at her house or she can meet me at mine. Now, these edits were simple and she could have just told me over the phone. We rarely see each other so her inviting me was out of the blue. 

When I got to her house, she told me about the simple edits. She gave me a beer and she grabbed a glass of wine. Idk if she was trying to socially lose things up and was expecting me to make a move...or was just wanting an alcoholic beverage. It was a Tuesday afternoon after all. 

Part of me feels like a missed opportunity. But I think it would be extremely creepy for me to make a move in her house when she just wanted some site edits done. So I played it safe. 

We have a lot in common and I'm interested but I'm not sure how to proceed or what other hints I should look for. Thoughts? 

**TL;DR:** Friend invited me to her house to talk about her business that could have easily been explained over the phone or email. Was she trying to hint something at me?"
dating_advice,Had a nice date. Being asked to wait a while for a second. Scared it'll never materialise - what should I do?,"**tl;dr:** had what I felt was a great date, although there wasn't much flirting going on. she said she liked our date and me a lot, but needed some time before committing to a second date, as she was working through some problems and didn't want to jump into something with the first date she had. we're still messaging, and she's been very nice to me so far. but i'm scared that either:

a) she's not attracted to me, but enjoys my company/doesn't want to be mean and doesn't want to outright reject me, or

b) any attraction is going to fade and i'll end consigned to a friend zone if no second date happens for a while.

Are these concerns valid? What can I/should I do to mitigate them?

**Context**: I'm a guy in his mid-twenties who's never had a relationship before, and very few dates. I struggle a lot with mental illness, primarily complex post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result, my confidence is terrible. I also have a lot of trouble perceiving and processing emotions.

**Story**: I went on a date with a girl earlier this week. It was my first non-online date (none of which have been successful), and I thought it went very well. I really enjoyed talking to her, and it felt that our conversation was very meaningful. There was a fair bit of teasing and joking, and we paid each other quite a few complements, but I don't think much flirting happened (which I don't know how to do and feel really uncomfortable with).

It felt like she truly opened up to me, and also wanted to learn a lot about my story. She's a Christian, and is serious about no sex before marriage and looking for something long term. So I wasn't expecting a kiss or anything too passionate (which is probably good for me, as that'd be overwhelming). We held hands on the way back, and I asked her if she wanted to do something again.

During our talk she'd opened up about having gotten out of an abusive relationship last year. I was her first date since, and she said that it had been a wonderful time. But she also wanted to wait before going on a second date, since she didn't want to throw herself in with the first man she saw.

I think she's telling the truth, but I'm scared that she was just looking for a polite way of trying to say no. She's continued to message me since - we've exchanged a few messages a day - so she seems to want us to keep in touch. I'm scared if this continues for too long, I'll no longer be seen by her as date material.

Are these valid concerns? And what can I do - or should I do - to try to improve my chances?

I really like her. And I've been suffering from intense loneliness and mental illness for so long that spending more time with her has come to be the thing I look forward to the most been the only thing on my mind."
dating_advice,What do I do?,"I was asked out on a date by an old friend of mine, and told him I'd think about it.

To be honest I got out of a very abusive relationship almost but not quite a year ago. My friend knows this. I don't go out but have solely focused on work, my kids and healing.  This friend and I go back quite a bit and we are in and out of each others life intermittently. I do have to say, I'm the one who always ""gets lost"" and he is persistent and always finds me. Not sure what to do. He is always lots of fun to be around and I have always enjoyed his company. Please help!"

So my question for the ones lost their virginity at my age or waited till marriage, should I keep it or just be relax and let it go??"
dating_advice,Scared to get dropped,"I (22M) met a girl (21F) on tinder last year in mid-december and was chatting with her every day. On the first saturday of 2020 we had an amazing date and kissed a lot and I felt very connected to her. After this we had like 6 more dates, slept together, held hands and kissed in public. Also she met my best friend and stayed a couple time over night. I think I am in love with her and I also think she likes me.  On the first date I said I‚Äòm looking for a relationship, but now I‚Äòm a bit scared that she isn‚Äòt looking for the same. On the penultimate date I saw she got a match on tinder and I guess she‚Äòll have a date tomorrow very likely. I know I‚Äòm a person who really tends to overthink things but I‚Äòm scared to engage with her and then get dropped. I had a breakup in may 2019 and it really took a lot of time to handle it.  I don‚Äòt want to get in this situation again soon. I think I could just ask her about our future together but maybe it‚Äòs to soon?"

dating_advice,Unsure if my hairdresser likes me or not.,"Been asking a few friends about this and had a lot of the same responses apart from one today, which has put me in a dilemma.

I've been going to her for around 5-6 years. Never really noticed anything in the past until my last visit and it's been playing on my mind ever since. I was sat in the waiting area waiting for her client to pay up, I noticed that she was looking at me in the mirror (seemed like she was gazing/in thought). As soon as our eyes met she broke eye contact and looked elsewhere. Later whilst she was cutting my hair she was telling me how good I smelt and kept repeating it. Lso mentioned how shes been out on a night out and kissed her ex's best friend, unsure whether this is a little ploy to see my reaction/make me jealous. I've also been telling her plans about going travelling and she mentioned about meeting me out there for a few weeks.

I've had an attraction to her for a while but have only realised since the whole mirror incident. It's been playing on my mind for a week but dont want to make it awkward between us. She cuts my dads and sisters hair also but seems to share more about her personal life with me.

There has been a bit of history. I've been out drinking with my friends. Was at the bar ordering drinks and get a cuddle from behind, had no idea who it was. Lasted a while and finally she let go and said hey, asked how my night was going etc. I offered her a drink and she gave me a peck on lips, she had a boyfriend at this point. (This was a few years ago)

I feel as if there is an attraction between us. It's the both time we've both been single. If I had a girlfriend she was single and if I was single she had a boyfriend. Shes recently become single (beginning of the year) so dont want to be a rebound.

I'm from the UK so we don't tip our hairdressers. Tempted to send her a message but unsure as it may come across as creepy and out of the blue.

What should I do?

TL;DR - Hairdresser recently single, looking at me in mirror and looked away when our eyes met, whilst waiting for a haircut. Told me I smelt really good and wouldnt shut up about it. Starting to send some signals but unsure. Mentioned she wants to meet me whilst I go travelling. From UK and we dont too so shes not doing it for tips."
dating_advice,Did I do something?,"Hi I‚Äôm a 24M, and I‚Äôve been dating a 21F for approximately 1.5 months now. We‚Äôve been on 5 total dates. The first 3 weeks since getting to know her, we would text pretty frequently back and forth, through iMessage, snap, and Instagram. Since then, the communication has died off significantly, maybe 10 texts throughout the day between us both combined, no snaps, nothing else on other social media apps. We had sex after the 4th date, which she said was great but after that, the communication and her seeming to care at all completely died off. The last few days it‚Äôs been 1-3 texts total texts between us and she even canceled our date that we had been planning on for a week now (she works about 60-70 hours a week so it‚Äôs hard for her to make time for anyone). She had sent me her schedule a month ago and it had said she was working yesterday a 12 hour shift, however she was posting on her Instagram story that she was out partying. 
I‚Äôve given every effort to want to be with this girl but she obviously doesn‚Äôt reciprocate the way I feel. What should I do? Has what we have run its course? Thanks"

dating is the very same thing. sometimes you will have influences from people who tell you to stop. ""they feel bad for you"", they ""pity you"", that you're ""trying to hard.""  simply smile and know that you must be doing something right to get such wildly assumptive responses, because the response itself is a true sign of your impact.  as for the women who read that in hopes of getting married some day.  just realize that most of those haters are chronic masturbators and video game players, and do not represent the majority of men... even if they say things like ""most people""  - lol they don't know anything and won't learn anything if they're life is revolved around video games and porn.  in fact, you can use that as a form of disqualifying them. keep kicking ass, you deserve it.

dating_advice,Worst Experience Of My Live - Almost Drove Me Into Insanity,"Hey Guys. Before I start rambling for awhile, This took place two years ago and i'm happy to be brought out of the situation. But something came back to where it reminded me of it.  


So this story starts back two years ago when I had just gotten out of highschool. During this time I was lonely, and had been interested in a couple of girls. I got rejected by all but one. For this story, we will name her DFH (Demon From Hell) So DFH is a straight hottie. She is cute, Good sexual features, likes to be close, and is very bubbly. When we had gotten together I thought I had struck pure gold and was lucky! The truth couldn't have been farther. Within a week of dating we had sex and were cuddling when DFH pulls out her phone. I naturally looked at it and it was on snapchat. I guess DFH didn't see me looking because she went to someone she had gotten a snap from and the message ""Rate?"" with a dick pic showed up on the screen. I immediately recoiled and DFH noticed. She started apologizing saying that someone had been harassing her. I asked DFH why she hadn't told me and DFH said she didn't want to bother me with stupid situations. Fair Enough I thought. We moved on and continued the night like normal. About a week later I went to go pick her up from her place after her being a no show to a planned date she was 30 minutes late with. I caught her with her side guy. Now back then I was still pretty new to relationships and was quite naive. I decided to give her another chance. The next bit is going to be in order of what happened.  


1. Cheated on me with one of my friends
2. Friend lied to me about it
3. She cheated on me with someone who was 27 (9 years older than us)
4. She met a guy and dated him, but told me that they were just friends.
5. Dated a guy out of town because he gave her vape pods
6. Got drunk with friends and kissed someone that was there
7. Decided I was going to dump her because it wasn't healthy for me. Took her out on one last date and it was pretty expensive. The whole time she was on her phone texting. She left her phone on the table when she went to go to the bathroom. I looked through it and lo and behold. She is texting not one, but two guys, leading them both on. I swiftly decided to leave and she was stuck with the check (As evidence from her angry messages later, it was $270 and she had to max out 3 of her cards to pay for it)

&amp;#x200B;

Now Recently DFH has tried coming back into my life. She (Yes and this is crazy) has a boyfriend who is hooked on ecstasy and recently got fired from his job for not showing up for a week. (He was looking for ecstasy) She said she realized how badly she messed up and that she wanted me back. (She was just looking for a place to stay and money) And I promptly told her that she'd first have to stop dating all the guys in town. Never got a message back.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Naive boy gets fucked by a cheating girlfriend

Disclaimer: Hey thanks everyone for reading this post. The main reason for posting is emotional support as I am still pretty messed up from this. I have my head straight now but it has changed me into a way different person. i.e I smoke now and even picked up a bad attitude and lack of motivation, as well as an extremely low self-esteem. Just needed to vent and talk to someone. So my relationship advice? If she cheat, she don't get the meat."
dating_advice,What could a girl never mentioning her boyfriend mean?,I've known her about 3 years now (she casually dated my friend for a few months years ago). I moved to the same city as her a few months ago and we've gotten closer since and for the last 2 months we've been consistently talking and I've developed quite the crush on her. I'm fairly certain the feeling is mostly mutual (friends who know us both think she may be interested) but I haven't made any move as she has a boyfriend. I only know this from a social media post months ago and he is in one of her profile pictures. She's never once mentioned him or not being single and I don't know if that's a good or bad sign.
dating_advice,What goes through your minds when you see or try to approach a guy with vitiligo on his face?,"I've decided today that I need to start actually asking women out on a more persevering basis. Because of my vitiligo all over my face and body I never had the confidence to do this in the past. I've just always found it hard to break through that whole dating circuit thing.

I know you are horrified by being approached in public by a stranger and you don't approach strangers neither. Having to make the first move it is like putting yourself in front of a panel for someone to say yay or nay, over and over. All they do is decide if you are good enough for them.

Anyway, one of the main barriers I find to asking someone out is that I'm more afraid that the askee will say ""Yes"" instead of saying ""No"" and that this ""Yes"" will be said out of pity more than anything else, I know I'm tired of the it makes you unique talk.

I've experienced this a few times before, where I'll ask an acquaintance on a date and she sort of winces and says ""Sure"". Then, either she ends up flaking out or I do because I can take a hint. I don't really want to go through a bunch of those again.

I have tried online dating and it is absolutely barren trying to find someone who will match with you and keep a conversation going. It can totally wrecked myself-esteem.

If you said being starved of any kind of positive attention for months or even years on end, then you're correct. Imagine all those compliments and attention you received over your lifespan. Now imagine none if it ever occurred. You now live a life of zero to next to nothing external validation, outward approval, or confirmation of any parts of your life."
dating_advice,Period sex,"I‚Äôm (F20)seeing this guy(M25) I haven‚Äôt seen in two months tonight. We planned to have sex a week ago, but I got my period today. Should I tell him before I see him that I‚Äôm on my period? Or wait until I see him?"
dating_advice,Where do you find people?,"Hi, (M22), I was living my normal life, I recently got out of college, into my first job but just other day, I felt something is missing from my life....  I haven't ever dated anyone, cause I was way too focused on my college and job. 
My question is where do you find people for dating, i mean there are people of female gender in my city, but there is no connection between me and anyone... How do I approach them, how do I ask them out... I don't know if you get what I am trying to say, but thanks"
dating_advice,Board/card games to have around my place,"Hey folks!

Went on a date with a girl, she asked me if we had any board or card games we could play at my place. I have a bunch of them in my old place, but I'm still getting stuff sent to me from there and it's 2,000 miles away. I'm looking for a great 2-player board/card game, doesn't have to be focused on dating, but I'd like to have something at the place for the two of us to do besides watch TV! I could get a generic game like Taboo or Monopoly but I was more hoping to find a game like Dixit or Coup (which is 2-player, I just don't have it with me). Anyone have any board or card game recommendations for 2 people? How about anything romantically-related?"

dating_advice,[24M] Saw a cute girl at a coffee shop today. How do I get her number?,She looked at me a few times and she seemed quite intrigued I feel. How should I approach her? Should I go back tomorrow?
dating_advice,How to start THAT conversation?,"I'm having trouble because my boyfriend and I are hardly ever serious about anything (one problem we have) and I need to talk about... Breaking up.

The more I think about it the worse I am at sticking to my resolve. I know we're not good as a couple but my heart says if he tells me he'll do better then I'll just go with it.

How do I start that talk? Where? Do I edit the ""unsendable letter"" I wrote and give it to him when we talk (I communicate so much better through written word, ngl) or is that weird? I don't wanna be a dick but I've never had to do this before."
dating_advice,Colleagues keep on sexually teasing me (19F) about other colleague (32M),"TLDR: older colleagues have been constantly bringing up other male colleague to me, always asking me to consider him as he has many good aspects, to the point where they make sick jokes of me and him kissing or doing lewd things. not sure if it‚Äôs an indication that he finds me attractive and thus told my colleagues about it, which led to their matchmaking. personally, i feel that this has gone too far.


I‚Äôve been a marketing intern at a ophthalmic company since September 2019, my colleagues (90% are male) are all very friendly and loving. They pamper me a lot as i‚Äôm physically the smallest and also the youngest. I‚Äôve been called cute and pretty by them many times.

Recently in Dec, a financial analyst joined, let‚Äôs name him M. I‚Äôve never really spoken to M often as we are from two different departments even though our seats are right behind each other. Last week was my last week as their intern as they are hiring me on contract in the financial department, meaning I‚Äôll have to sit beside M and work with him. However, about 3 weeks back, my marketing colleagues have been constantly shoving M‚Äôs name into my face when we go out to eat, even making sick jokes about me sitting on his lap when I get hired as a contract staff and that I should consider him. He‚Äôs actually pretty wealthy and is single. 

At first I thought it was a joke, so I brushed it off, but my friend and I realised that they kept on talking about M to me, as if they really wanted me to consider him, even to the extent of playing a game where they didn‚Äôt want to let me end it until I chose to marry M. I then realised that he actually stares at me very often, and would often just steal glances at me every day. To make matters worse, I found out from some of my colleagues in operations today that rumours have been going around that I like M. How could that happen when I wasn‚Äôt the one who asked about him, talked about him. I never once mentioned him to any of my colleagues. 

But all of a sudden they want to match make us, and now people are gossiping that I like him? Do you have any reasons as to what‚Äôs going on? Colleagues in operations have also been pushing me ‚ÄúWhat if he likes you? Would you consider him?‚Äù I‚Äôm very lost as to what‚Äôs going on.My intern friend says there‚Äôs a possibility that M is interested in me that‚Äôs why all these are happening, and that he probably told my colleagues about it. I‚Äôm afraid that this will affect my working relationship with him when I start my contract in March. I‚Äôm honestly pretty upset by all the rumours bc it‚Äôs such a bad start to my full time position."

dating_advice,Meeting new people,"So I just moved to a new city and state and there's tons of beautiful white women here and I would really like to meet some. I feel though I'm not interesting enough to strike up a conversation that'll interest them. I have a tinder and I get plenty of likes by beautiful women but as soon as I start chatting with them  they kind of fall off after a few days of texting. I guess my question is, is what kind of topics do I conversate about that says "" I wanna really get to know you"" without sounding boring. And how do you get a girl to start texting you back again after she's fallen off without sounding desperate?"
dating_advice,I love the girl I sit next to in school and I need some advice because the sitaution is unclear to me.,"So this is my first reddit post so I will probably do something wrong also english is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes and overused words as I don't know all the phrases one would use to make a wall of text more interesting.

So I am 16 years old and I am currently going to school and I have been sitting next to the same girl for the last 3 years and recently I just fell for her.

But I am shy I don't have any friends I am not that socially skilled and I of course know nothing of how the other gender thinks. However I have been warming up about talking to people (maybe that's just the end of puberty). So around 4 weeks ago I started talking to her more but only in class and it is always a little flirty.

And so a week goes by and I love talking to her because it is also always funny. In fact one day I found out that  i am the funniest person she knows. Like she laughs at every joke I tell even the bad ones even when I just agree with her on how annoying that one teacher is.

Now the next week she starts to tease me by drawing on my arm. And bends my fingers in weird ways so i grab her hand to make her stop. And when I let her hand go she does it again and again until I grab her hand again and this time I hold onto it under the table. And I just thought I might as well and started stroking her hand and she returned the favour and she never said anything about it. No remarks. Nothing. That goes on like that for the rest of the week.

And then the next week  she goes in for my hand I grab hers but this time she lifts my hand and places it on her thigh and lets go. And I turn my hand and grab her thigh. And start stroking it. Again she says nothing but when i take my hand off she goes for my hand again and she puts it back on her thigh. That goes on for the rest of the week again.

Now on the weekend I on a website where you can anonymously ask people questions and since she has an account that site I just went ahead and asked if she is currently in love with someone and she replied: no

At that point I started to feel lost I mean you don't just let anyone stroke your thigh do you?

But wait it gets more confusing. Last week things repeat and I have my hand on her thigh this time however I work my way up her thigh over to her crotch and I reach further down. Because she didn't keep me in any way from it so I start stroking her crotch and I went deeper and deeper and suddenly she took my hand and put it back on her thigh. Ok I thought she doesn't want that for whatever reason but I respect it. I didn't want her to be uncomfortable so I pull away my hand from her thigh but she reaches for it and puts it back.

The rest of the week is pretty much the same except for friday.

On friday I just started going upwards from her thigh over her stomach up to her chest and I just ever so slightly touched her boobs about two times but only with one finger but still I am sure she felt it. After that I also went to her back but because of the chair I couldn't put my hand flat on her back so I just started touching her all over her side and went back down to her thigh and as always she never said anything about it.

And now after having explained what kind of weird situation I'm in. I just need to know.

What is going on does she like me or not? Does she just let me do it because it feels good essentially using me or what?

I just don't know what it is and i feel lost because while all this is going on we never exchanged a single word outside of the class room and I don't have her phone number so we don't text. And as I stated above she says she is not currently in love.

If anyone wants more information or wants me to clarify something more just go ahead and ask.

So please someone tell me just what is going on?"

We flirted a bit and threw some funny jokes, in the end she told me the offer 50% expires today I said to be honest I dont think I will be subscribing today because my subscription didnt expire yet at the old gym.

But I told her that her reception and showing me around was very friendly and nice. Then she gave me her number and said she would call me once they have more offers. In my country girls dont do that a lot? Thats what I think? I really like her and want to get to know her, and its the first time a girl gives me her number, but I dont want to look like a fool and embarrass myself, maybe she did it strictly for business and I dont want to seem desperate or creepy... I need help, how do I approach this situation and ask her out?"
dating_advice,Should I bother continuing?,"I‚Äôve been speaking to a guy for 4 months. We went on our first date after two months of speaking. And then our second another month after. The issue is that he‚Äôs genuinely busy. He‚Äôs a full time student, has two jobs which one is his own business and requires travel and also cares for his sick parents. Now he‚Äôs talking about moving to another city for half a week as it‚Äôll be easier for him to run his business. 

He always made the effort to contact me regularly and since our second date we speak every day. I feel like we hit it off very well. I‚Äôm very attracted to him. We have a lot of things in common. He makes me laugh. He also has the ability to talk to me on a deeper level. He tells me he feels the same about me. I have asked him several times when do we get to see each other and he tells me ‚Äòvery soon‚Äô with the kissing emoji. 

Despite only two actual dates, I‚Äôm starting to get feelings for this guy. But I‚Äôm starting to feel very romantically and sexually lonely. He doesn‚Äôt have the time for me and I need someone who‚Äôs going to give me more time. 

Do you think it‚Äôs worth waiting it out to see if things get better in terms of seeing each other more often? I do really like him. Or better cut things off soon before I get too hurt?"

dating_advice,Nervous for first date.,"So I (20m) landed a date this Saturday (tomorrow) with a girl (20f) I've been texting for the past month. Just use two are getting dinner and window shopping at the mall and maybe a movie even.

Biggest problem here is that this is my 2nd first date ever, and my last first date was over two years ago. So I'm nervous as to how things will turn out and what to expect. Like do I ask her if she wants to be dating? Do I try to kiss her? When? And if I don't have the courage to do so then what? Do I tell her that I find her attractive and that we have a lot in common? Do I just let the night carry itself along? Go with the flow? Am I supposed to feel it and act on it in the moment? 

Just dont know the first date roadmap I suppose."
dating_advice,How do you know you're ready to date post break up?,"For a bit of context: my (24m) gf (22f) of three years and I broke up two months ago. I still love her but she made it very clear she does not want a relationship right now and the chances of us getting back together are slim to none. I'm over her in the sense I feel I deserve a lot more and would like to get back out there. 

I've dabbled on dating apps but specifically looking for friends not a partner because I'm not sure I'm ready for that. Recently a friend of mine reconnected me with a girl from my old job I had a huge crush on so I would like to take her out on a date. He let her know right off the bat that I was really into her and called it a date so I feel I'm at a bit of a disadvantage since I wanted to start off as friends and go from there. If we hit it off I could definitely see myself dating her though, she's very beautiful and has a vibrant personality. My biggest fear is I'll be too reluctant because I'm still grieving my past relationship but at the same time I don't want to mess up this opportunity.

So my question is:
How or when did you know you were over your break up and ready to date again?"

dating_advice,[22M] dating a rich girl [21F] I met on a dating app.,"this is not the first time we've talked, been on a couple of dates together and we've only met at public places so far and agree to meet up at a spot etc etc, we talked about our family backgrounds and which neighbourhood we're from (upper-middle class area) and I'm used to having friends who are ""comfortable"" growing up and not think of anything about it.   
Anyway last week we made plans to go out for lunch after my class (i'm in university) so she said she'd pick me up because I don't have a car.     


So right after lunchtime, she picked me up and to my surprise, she comes around in an S63 AMG. Now if u don't know what that is it's basically a really expensive car, like a really really expensive Mercedes. Lmao so I only had 10 bucks in my wallet so we decided to go to a food truck and spent the afternoon with a 4-hour conversation in a park. We get along really well from our past dates and all but it just clicked in my head how different we are economically... so far all our dates we've been going dutch and going to cheap places and restaurants. And before this, she used to tell me she ubers, or just park somewhere far away and actually take an uber.  I don't know how to process this information and I don't want to look like golddigger either. But what the hell? im confused, decent girl though I just don't know if I want to date her... unsure about it"
dating_advice,Should I start a casual relationship with my friend?,"I (21M) have a friend, let‚Äôs call her Allie (25F). Allie and I are coworkers who have become best friends over the past two years. She‚Äôs a great person, and me, her and my other best friend (let‚Äôs call him John(21M)) are like the Three Musketeers at work. We hang out all the time after work and constantly text each other. 

I‚Äôm a virgin, and the two of them are not. In fact, all of my friends are not virgins and at this point, I‚Äôm the only one who is. I don‚Äôt even know if I want a relationship at this point, as I‚Äôm in a constant state of ‚ÄúTalking to a new girl, flirt with her, she leaves and I‚Äôm lonely again‚Äù cycle. However, Allie is more casual: she has had a few casual relationships and she has recently been hooking up with one of our other coworkers (23M) but they don‚Äôt anymore. I wanna talk to her about maybe starting something casual with her (if you‚Äôre gonna ask about John, he is Hispanic and Allie has no preference for Hispanics). I had feelings for her when we started hanging out but I got over them a year ago. Now every so often I think about her sexually and I wonder if she‚Äôd be interested in something casual and taking my virginity. 

So Reddit, should I ask her? And if so, how do I even approach that situation? What do I say?"

dating_advice,"I think I'm in, idk what do you guys think?","I'm in a college program in which there are very few girls, let alone attractive ones. I'm now in my 4th semester in and I was completely shocked when I saw a cute girl sitting in class. Now my class is filled with generally a lot of nerds, so I didn't want to be that guy who just hits on the cute girl right away, so instead I let my presence be known. I sat next to her and basically joked around with my buddy. I did this twice. The next week I got to class early, so I sat where I was sitting before in the same row she normally sits, and left a seat open for her. Sure enough she comes in before anyone and sits beside me. The same thing happened the following class. I took it as a good sign but thought that maybe she just likes that particular seat, so I thought I'd try a little experiment. When I got to class yesterday, I decided to again sit 3 seats in, but the row below the one I've been sitting. Sure enough she comes into the room, and takes the seat next to me, instead of the row she normally sits.

This isn't me overthinking anything or being a Beta, it's just a tricky situation because women have to deal with socially awkward creeps in my field a lot, and making someone uncomfortable is the last thing I want. So normally I wouldn't have to play these stupid games and I'd just flirt right away, but a classroom isn't the right environment for that. So instead I'm just going to befriend her first (I've never seen her talk to anyone in the class yet, so my guess is she doesn't have any friends in our program anyway), and see where it goes."

dating_advice,GF became distant after I told her my true feelings.,Long story short my GF and I have been good friends for a long time then Fwbs and then over the past month or two became exclusive. She's been telling me how much she cares for me and basically explaining to me she loves me. So I told her that I basically love her too and she's my best friend etc. But ever since I've told her that about a week ago she's been slow to respond and we usually hang out a few times a week but we have no plans or anything this or next week. I guess I could ask but then again ask what all I did was tell her my feelings it's not like I said anything bad. My GF is a pretty free spirited women and I've been pretty closed with my feelings with her because to be honest I don't really want to become emotionally attached too much till the butterfly and rainbows are over and were still in that honeymoon phase. So now I'm thinking she thinks I'm needy or something but overall I'm pretty confused. At the moment I've just sort of let her be distant I'm guessing in a week I should probably just ask what's going on.

What should I do? How do I tell her I like her and I want to have a relationship with her? Oh, and btw I never had a girlfriend before."
dating_advice,Should I date her?,"So (30m) I‚Äôve been single for the past 3.5 years. Have gone on dates and fooled around with a handful of girls since then but nothing stuck. After my last relationship I met a (25f) girl whom I‚Äôve been FWB with off and on the past 3.5 years to this day. This entire time I‚Äôve stayed single, but she has not, hence why it‚Äôs off and on. 

When we first met, it was like any new relationship, we went on dates, had sex, did fun things together, I met her parents, all things that would lead to the next level. So after about 2-3 months we decided to make it official that we were dating. 1 week later she dumps me. I don‚Äôt remember her reasoning exactly since it was so long ago but something along of the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for this.‚Äù Okay fine. 

We stop taking and about 2 months later she‚Äôs back dating the guy she dated before me. (Saw it on social media) I‚Äôm like uh okay I thought she wasn‚Äôt ready but whatever. They date for roughly 8-9 months, break up, then she hits me up to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù (have sex). I was in a slump and we have great sex so I said sure. We become FWB again for about 2-3 months, mostly sex, sometimes we‚Äôd go out for dinner and drinks, after sex we‚Äôd sleep over 90% of the time, cuddled, watch movies etc. 

After this little stint, she leaves me again to date the original guy for a 3rd time. At this point I don‚Äôt really have emotions for her, and since it‚Äôs happened before I‚Äôm like cool do your thing. 

Another maybe 8 months go by, they break up again and she hits me back up....lol I know. Again, we have great sex so I‚Äôm like sure. This time it goes on for a little longer maybe 4-5 months. Then AGAIN, she starts dating some new guy, leaves me. That lasts a month, didn‚Äôt work out, back to me for a 4th time. 

In this entire time we were FWB, she wouldn‚Äôt tell me about other guys until she started officially dating them. So she would sleep with them, while sleeping with me, and not tell me unless it became more serious. Me, on the other hand, never fooled around with other girls while we were FWB because she fulfilled all my sexual desires, I didn‚Äôt need to seek it elsewhere. 

Now, we‚Äôre poor at communicating what the ‚Äúrules‚Äù to our FWB relationship was, since she would sleep around and I wouldn‚Äôt. (I thought that was common courtesy not to). We both knew that we went on dates with other people, but I did not know she was sleeping around as well. I just found this out the other day, so I was kinda upset but also understanding since we never really discussed it. 

Yesterday, she tells me she sees more boyfriend/husband material in me than ever before in the past few weeks and is starting to get a crush on me (actual feelings).  I have been trying new things and bettering myself lately, so I can see how that‚Äôs attractive.  I have always liked her as a person, we vibe very well, have great sex, and can just be genuine around each other, always have been over the past 3.5 years. But all these instances of her leaving to date another guy has me very hesitant to pursue anything. She always comes back to me after dating and has never told me about feelings because she thought I was uninterested in that. (Again poor communication between us)

So I‚Äôm wondering, do I try to make this work? 

Obviously, we would need to improve our communication with each other.  But I‚Äôm also scared that if I put it all out there I‚Äôm just gonna get dumped again, since it was easy for her to leave me many times before."

dating_advice,"I found this social media called ""Wawwuly"" using google search, and here are reasons to tap into it's potentials early enough","So I was surfing the internet lately to discover how to make new friends, date and connect with the world. 

The norms is to go through tinder, twitter, IG, FB, snap the regular and popular social media.

Then I came across an article about a newly launched, fun, interesting, trending and top buzzing social media called ""Wawwuly"". I was curious to find out what it's all about. Guess what? On signing up I was not disappointed, in fact I was really impressed, its just like twitter, IG, FB &amp; Snap all in one unique platform. 

You can post words, pictures, videos, status, voice notes, gif, links, polls and so on with no limits. Users are from all locations the world over. 

I have since been optimising it as Wawwuly is giving user verification easily to its active users which of course would become much more difficult with time. 

My account actually got verified in about just a week. Imagine those that tapped into the potentials of Twitter, Instagram, even reddit early enough, they are influencers already. 

The URL is wawwuly. com and sign up is free lol. 

They promise mobile apps are coming soon.

Thank me later"

My coworker (M) and I (F) work in large organization (different city) and met almost every month for work convention. Through coincidence we often stumbled across each other.

When we‚Äôre in the same city, we met for couple of lunch and dinners together (just the two of us) and it‚Äôs half personal convo half work. But the vibes are good and we both are comfortable with each other presence.

dating_advice,"[F22] I miss this and that, but I'm also tired.","I miss being excited. I miss my energy.

Hi. I just really need to let this out.

I've been single for 3 years now, there are times I want to be in a relationship again, but I change my mind after a minute or so; there's this constant reminder that it's draining, emotionally and mentally. I love tenderly and loyally, I guess I'm just afraid to commit again. I feel like, the more I love, the greater the tendecy to be in pain. 

My first and last relationship lasted for 6 months only, it took me 2 years to move on (on and off). Yup, I know. Stupid. I'm judging myself too. But I belive a person's impact isn't measured on time. The experience taught me a lot, I continued to learn to love myself. I focused more on my goals and dreams. My perspective widen etc. I trusted the whole process. But it's also the reason why my walls are thicker and higher. Sure, I can work on letting a person in my life again. But how can I make sure I won't be left building another set of walls again? That they won't ghost me? Or make it look all true, fuel it with sweet words etc. just to know I'm an insignificant love? I guess I just want to be sure we'll put the same effort and loyalty in the relationship, that we're on the same page. The word is ASSURANCE. 

I'm willing to put an effort in meeting someone, but my social life has been dead since I graduated college. My mind is always in the state of: I need to work more, build myself, achieve this and that, get more jobs than I should have, etc. I like being productive, but I sometimes feel I'm missing the fun of life. 

I miss cuddles, having someone to talk to about anything, being excited, being loved and able to give it back without hesitation. I've tried dating apps and man, it's fucking tiring. The whole process of hi hellos, getting to know each other, trying to find that ""connection"", ghosting etc. It's mentally exhausting. 

If you've made it this far, thank you. Just really need to let it out, been stressed these past weeks due to work and this whole frustration.

This post may have or have not made me sound cynical, but I/I'm also:
- VERY INDEPENDENT
- naturally caring and thoughtful (like a mom)
- funny and witty (tHIS IS ACCORDING TO MY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO)
- like to make fun of myself as a copping mechanism when I'm suffering
- VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE :(( can cheer you up in any way possible, as long as you're not being stupid/trying to hurt others/etc.
- sensitive to others' feelings. I always symphatise with others more than I do with myself looool

Probably just a rant, but can also use your helping words. Or send me a message if you're interested in talking, I guess??? We'll see. 

That's just it. To you reading this, I really hope you're well :)x"

dating_advice,Are women that get obsessed bad?,"Hey, so I'm a woman (22F) and I'm wondering if this is a big issue or even red flag to men.

To explain, I'm not proposing during the first conversation or anything, but I have a habit of fixating on men (and people in general, it's just my personality). I've pretty intensely ""cyber stalked"" every guy I've been interested in, often before they even know I exist. 

Obviously I never reveal this to them, so it's not the real issue, but feel it illustrates my personality. When it comes to actual interactions, I worry I go too full on and blunt and it may be ruining my chances. I usually do the pursuing, I've been known to send them pictures I draw of them (I draw cartoons), and I ask a lot of questions about them when we do finally converse. I'm also very kind and generous, sometimes going out of my way to get them food or buy gifts/clothing. Not right away with the gifts, mind you, but a bit further into our friendship/courtship. I also compliment them often, so much so that one commented on it.

I also want to add that I do nothing harmful or manipulative and I accept rejections well. I do not pressure or guilt trip them, nor do I threaten them with either violence or information I may have dug up. I would *never* dream of hurting these men as I believe them to be precious and wonderful. The cyber stalking is mainly for my own satisfaction or to make interpersonal interactions easier. Since I am nervous, knowing many of the answers to questions I ask makes me less awkward overall since I have planned reactions.

Does any of my behaviour sound like it could be a real turn off? I simply cannot play aloof because it would be dishonest and I'm a horrible actor hahaha. Is it possible for me to find someone who loves like I do? It would be ideal to find someone just as intense...but also kind."
dating_advice,Giving up on even trying,"I posted here recently with my unique situation and although people have been kind to give some support in my endeavors I don't see myself being someone who will be able to provide any substance to a relationship. As a guy about to be 27 with my medical issues I'm going to be someone that needs help and care eventually. So as much as I would like to pursue someone, theres always a better choice for her out there in today's age. Women get the choice of the crop and I know I'm at the bottom."
dating_advice,Girlfriend hardly ever initiates anything,"I've been the one to initiate every single one of our dates. There have been a couple of times (literally 2 times) where she has come up with something, but that's after I already established we were going out. She has never actually asked me out on a date once, and it's been nearly 4 months.

I do not have a dominant personality whatsoever, so it feels awkward and unnatural for me to take on the typical boyfriend role; being the provider, caregiver, protector, etc.. The problem is that she is very comfortable in the typical girlfriend role, and doesn't seem to have any desire to flip the script.

There are a lot of things that I've expressed a clear desire for, but she has yet to do. For example, I've told her I prefer being the little spoon, and yet the only time she's been the big spoon was when I practically begged for it (maybe 3 times). Every time we cuddle, she automatically assumes the little spoon position and I feel like I have no choice. She has never ONCE just spontaneously decide to be the big spoon. She never goes out of her way to be the ""giver"" of any physical affection.

I'm hesitating to even make this post because I feel like this makes me seem selfish, but I can't spend my life being the giver and never the receiver. It makes me feel unloved, even though I KNOW for a fact she really cares about me. I guess it's just a mismatch in our love languages.

I've tried talking to her about this stuff and I know she listens and understands, but I think she's anxious or nervous about it. She does have anxiety and has been through a few abusive past relationships, so I can understand why she's hesitant about these things, so how can I encourage her?"

Latter she texted me, ""I can't  date you, I have too much going on in my life right now. I texted back ""I meant to just hang out as friends. I do not date."" She replied with the blank face emoji and said ""I'm good."" I replied ""Sorry I didn't explain what I meant more carefully.""

dating_advice,To Ghost or Not To Ghost,"So: A couple of days ago I signed up for Tinder for the first time. Just wanted to see what the app was about. Literally the first person I talked was this cute, smart guy with whom I had a great conversation. This is something that from my experience doesn't necessarily happen the often.

Yesterday he asked to meet me in person. I'm kind of freaking out, because I hadn't signed up for Tinder to actually meet anyone. I just wanted to chat with some guys. In the other apps I use you can mark clearly that you're interested in ""chat only,"" but not on Tinder. I realized now I should've put it on my bio at least, so that's on me.

So I panicked and told him I'd love to meet him.

Thing is, I'm really not in any condition to be meeting people. I'm dealing with depression, a substance abuse problem I'm struggling to overcome, and just have a bunch of family and work worries. I'm working to get better and put my life in order, but I don't want to meet anyone while I'm feeling like this.

So what do I do with this guy? Do I ghost him? I've considered just deleting my Tinder account, but I wonder if that'll be rude hurt his feelings, while at the same time I consider the fact that we've literally only just had a few convos. If he's at all the mature, well-adjusted person he seems to be, surely he'd be able to shrug it off? Or am I just rationalizing my cowardice?

I think the RIGHT thing to do would be to tell him I don't want to meet him in person at all. But that would require explaining to a near stranger all this shit about where my life is at right now, and that seems kind of ... basket-casey? And a little humiliating? 

So: would I be a total dick if I just deleted my Tinder account with no explanation beforehand? I'd appreciate any advice!"
dating_advice,Have a first date tonight feeling nervous. (Details in post),"So let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm(30m) taking a woman(26f)  I met through a mutual friend out for the first time. I‚Äôve done this dance 100 times and I never really get nervous about it. The caveat is that, this is my first real date since a massive car accident 6 months ago that left me with 2 dislocated hips, a broken heart(my ex of 3 years left me as soon as I was well enough to take bad news), and a new found sobriety. 
I‚Äôm really not the type to get nervous around girls I like after they agree to a date because honestly if someone wants to spend time alone with you, that‚Äôs already a huge indicator that you like each other. The problem is that I‚Äôve always kind of used alcohol as a way to deal with the anxiety before ‚Äúthe big move‚Äù, Without building too many expectations I‚Äôm pretty sure at some point tonight she‚Äôs going to want me to kiss her, I‚Äôm afraid I just won‚Äôt have the guts sober. 
I‚Äôm an art dealer and she‚Äôs and art therapist, we both love reading, and eating out. Everything is cosmically aligned to make for a great date full of great conversation. Why the heck am I so nervous about this thing?? Why do I have this looming feeling that I‚Äôm gonna over play my hand and end up ruining it. We‚Äôre doing a nice night out for ramen and then going back to her place for coconut oil massages. I mean, Jesus, what else could she possibly suggest to make it more obvious she‚Äôs into me. WHAT ARE THESE NERVES ABOUT?!? These are her suggestions btw, and no It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúshe‚Äôs being to forward thing‚Äù I love strong woman that say what they want.

dating_advice,I have been spoiled for any future relationship. How the hell am I ever going to find love?,"I (19f) very briefly dated a wonderful man (19m). We had to stop seeing each other due to a very unusual and unfortunate circumstance that was outside of either of our control. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going through an actual breakup as we didn‚Äôt date long enough to reasonably call it a relationship. But he opened my eyes to a whole new world, taught me that I can have self-respect, and my standards have been forever changed. 

Never again will I date someone I don‚Äôt feel any sort of connection with. 

Never again will I date someone who doesn‚Äôt care about my safety.

Never again will I date someone who seems to have an antagonistic relationship with everyone he knows. 

Never again will I have sex with someone if I don‚Äôt want to, or feel obligated to go all the way because of ‚Äúblue balls‚Äù.

Never again will I date someone who doesn‚Äôt care about my interests, and/or has absolutely nothing in common with me, and/or sees me as just a sexy body to lay with and play with while he watches his favorite movies.

I‚Äôm so proud of myself for setting new standards, but they‚Äôre a lot harder to meet than my old ones, and while I know there are plenty of guys out there who meet them, the process of actually finding one of these men seems incredibly daunting. I don‚Äôt even know where to start.

dating_advice,Mixed signals of both being interested and being super not interested,"(18M) (18F)

Okay so there is this girl I‚Äôve known practically throughout my entire high school experience and I‚Äôve had a bit of a crush on her the entire way through. During my 2nd year I had actually asked her out on a date but in hindsight I can tell that it went pretty bad. 

It was awkward at first but it eventually ended up okay at the end of the 2nd year. From there on is where the mixed signals come in, to this day I always kinda catch her staring at me in class and when I had a girlfriend during the beginning of my 4th year she would look super sad and I can see her avoiding contact with us. And I would send a text to try to get things started again and would go days without a text back almost every time. I would just call myself crazy and stop texting, but even more stares and rarely she would actually text me first before leaving me on read üòÇ  what‚Äôs up with her??

But yeah that‚Äôs pretty much the gist of it

dating_advice,The one that got away?,"Trying something new in coming here for some advice. I‚Äôve (25f) been seeing this guy (29 - I use the term ‚Äúseeing‚Äù loosely) for a couple months. We ‚Äútried‚Äù dating, and since he‚Äôs in med school, the timing just wasn‚Äôt right. We broke it off, but continue to talk all the time and occasionally hook up. 

It‚Äôs brutal. I started seeing someone else briefly recently, but broke it off because I couldn‚Äôt stop comparing him to how I felt with mr. med school. 

I had this crazy connection with my ex, and even though that ended terribly, I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find that spark again...until I met this guy. I‚Äôm reminded of him everywhere  - in a cute dog on the street or a meme on the internet or a funny thing that happens at work. I have a feeling he doesn‚Äôt feel a fraction of what I feel for him, which makes it worse, but he‚Äôs also really hard to read on the whole thing, which makes it double worse. But I also can‚Äôt imagine him not being in my life at all.

What do I do?"
dating_advice,Should I just don't show up,"So we met around three weeks ago at a political educational trip and as we were partying in the evening with some people, I noticed her interest immediately, but I didn't take it further that evening as I wasn't sure.
A week later we stayed at the same place to continue and I was essentially sure, that she was intered, but since I am generally undesirable and ugly and rarely women show any sort of interest in me, I still didn't make a move. 

Another week days later (this weekend ) she send me a message reacting to one of my social media posts, so we began to chat. The conversation went back and forth and I now I was really sure, that she was into me and she reacted to all my implications, made me compliments. 

The next day we actually chatted a little more and she even implied, that she'd like to kiss me and hear my voice again and that she would like to meet, but because it was already late and be both didn't have the time to do something that evening, I called her and we actually had a good conversation. During that conversation I asked her out and she seemed genuinely happy and excited. Afterwards we texted some more, during which she told me, that she missed me and we agreed, that I would come up with something and she would just get the time and place. 

Sounds good so far doesn't it? 

Afterwards we didn't really communicate until for a few days until we were both at the same event on Thursday, but we did not talk at all. It was an event, where it would have been inappropriate to flirt or anything like that, but we didn't even talk. 
On the same day I texted her, where and when I planned to meet her on Saturday, but she didn't answer for a solid day (until now), although I know, that she read it yesterday. 

How am I supposed to interpret this behavior? Up to this point she always seemed to be the one, who was more interested, but now I have the feeling, that she has completely lost interest. Should I even turn up, or admit defeat in dignity and cancel the damn thing or just don't show up at all..."

I‚Äôve never approached a girl and made it clear I wanna get to know her, because I feel to ugly for her to be interested, and I can‚Äôt be bothered to deal with the fallout of getting rejected. Also seems like a weird way to strike up a friendship.

dating_advice,Girl interested or not?,"

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn‚Äôt slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don‚Äôt understand if she‚Äôs losing interest shouldn‚Äôt she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I‚Äôm deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I‚Äôm going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I‚Äôm just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?"
dating_advice,How long should you wait for your date to show up before you can consider yourself stood up?,...‚òπÔ∏è
dating_advice,"The dreaded ""situation-ship"""," So I've found myself in a ""situation-ship"" and am unsure of what to do. I got on the dating apps for the first time ever last August. At first, I was just looking for casual hook-ups. Easy enough. Recently though, I've started to feel like I want more. I met this guy in December. At first, it was like dating. He took me out a couple of times, we hooked up, he brought me food when I was sick, etc. At some point, not sure when, we suddenly fell into this cycle. We text every day and see each other about once or twice a week. He comes over after work, we order out or cook, watch some TV, hook-up and then he sleeps over. So I'd say it's been about a month of that. We haven't gone out-out since like date #3 in December. 

At first, I was cool with it. Honestly, the sex is amazing and we get along really well, but I'm not sure if we could make a relationship work. He's younger than me by five years, which doesn't usually matter, but he's 25 and I'm 30. I feel like that's a five year age gap that matters. And there are other tiny personality clashes (ex: he's a personal trainer/health nut who sometimes has a bad habit of getting on me about working out more or what I'm eating aka advice I didn't ask for nor do I need). We haven't really talked about what we're doing or where it's going. I think the closest we got was that he said he appreciated that I was so easygoing and didn't put any pressure on him.   
I still browse the apps, and I think he probably does too. I stumbled across one of his dating profiles the other day and saw he updated the bio. Anyways, I said fuck it and went out on a date last weekend and met this man who I now have the biggest crush on. We've been out twice and I have no idea what he's looking for or what he wants, but I sort of want to see where this goes. So now I don't know what to do about my situation-ship with this younger guy. Am I wrong in thinking it even is a situation-ship? Are we dating in his eyes? I know I won't know unless I ask, but I gotta assume the fact that we've been just hanging out at my place and hooking up for a month means he's not interested in anything more...we could be going out on dates, but we're not. 

Should I just have a very candid conversation? Should I ease off and see what happens? I got myself into a pickle (and really only have myself to blame). 

TL,DR: Been in a situation-ship with a younger guy (coming over after work, ordering food, sex, sleeping over) for about a month and a half, but met another man I really, really like. Not sure what to do."
dating_advice,I like first dates and hate that I‚Äôm expected to go on a second one,"Can anyone relate?

I like going on first dates especially when they go well, but I hate dealing with the aftermath. 

Even when a date goes well, I have a good time and I kind of like the guy, I generally don‚Äôt want to see him again. Or at least not immediately, maybe after 2-3 weeks or so, depending on how he handles the situation. 

I‚Äôve had guys get angry at me for not being interested in going out again soon, some calling me a ‚Äútime waster‚Äù, or saying that I was playing games, because they don‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt want to see them again since the date went well. Obviously this has helped me filter out entitled/ insecure guys, and I‚Äôm not mad about it. 

But I‚Äôd like to know that I‚Äôm not the only one who needs quiet time after a date to find interest again. And maybe understand the psychology behind it?"
dating_advice,Age difference or not just into me,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have met a wonderful woman a few months ago but things have grown to what I can only describe, for lack of better words, as being weird. I am in my mid-thirties and she‚Äôs actually 10 years younger than I am. So far, the age difference hasn‚Äôt seemed to be an issue, at least not for me. We can hold discussions with one another, she can understand my references as I can understand hers and we laugh a lot while being together.

Problem is, all signs seem to point that she‚Äôs not really into me. Here‚Äôs what I mean.

The good signs: She‚Äôs always very expressive when talking or writing to me. Shows a lot of excitement when planning to do things together, and when I offer to meet on a day that doesn‚Äôt suit her schedule, she always provides 2 or 3 other options when we can meet. And when we do meet, we usually spend a whole day together.

The bad signs: Lately, communication has been slow. I always have to initiate contact and she takes several days to answer me back. We have come to see each other about once a month due to our mutual hectic schedules. I have a feeling that I may be more into her than she is into me. So far, we‚Äôve only cuddled together. Haven‚Äôt reached first based yet.

Am I too old-fashioned to expect quicker replies or should I take it as a sign that she‚Äôs not really interested in me?"
dating_advice,Should I text him after a week of no contact?,"I'm (25F) dating this guy (28M) for 2 months now, we met up around 7 times. We were always really honest with each other and kept bringing up wanting to date for a longer time and also wanting a relationship. 

Our texting was always quite weak but he would have send a message everyday at least. He invited me for dinner 2 weeks ago and kept apologizing that uni is being super stressful and he has some personal stuff that is bothering him. So, as I didn't want to bother him any more, I told him I'll understand and we'll just see where it goes. Now after this dinner he did text me right after it and we exchanged some brief texts. 

Then, 4 days later, nothing at all so I text him if everything is okay and he just sends me a long message with what he has done this day and asked me how I have been. I respond but then tell him that I'll let him focus on his things and wish him a good night. No response after that and this has been a little over a week now. 

Should I just let it go? Or should I tell him that this behaviour is not okay especially as we agreed on being always open and address everything. I mean not talking to someone for over a week isn't okay or am I being too dramatic about it?  

Would love to hear your opinions on that!"

dating_advice,First Date Red Flags?,"It was out first date. Met this guy from tinder, he seems very charismatic and like an awesome guy. 
However, there were a couple things which surprised me. The first thing was towards the end of the date he was mentioning that he was an ‚Äúass‚Äù man and that he wasn‚Äôt asking for ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and went on to describe the features he likes on a girl. 

I laughed it off, not thinking too much of it. 

Then he kept telling me how he hasn‚Äôt got that much money and that most of it goes towards his house etc, which was interesting for me to hear. 

As the date was nearing I decided to pay the bill and he thanked me with a tap on the shoulder. Finally we went for a walk and spoke about our past experiences and he said it... ‚Äúmy ex was crazy‚Äù; she lashed out on me, had bipolar, was ill etc.

What are your thoughts?"
dating_advice,My relationship is heading towards insanity,"I am a Male of 16 years of age who has been in a relationship with my girlfriend (15 years of age) for a little over a year now. 

We met in middle school and she was in an abusive relationship at the time with a girl who had many issues mentally, this essentially skyrocketed my girlfriend (let's call her J) into a depressive state and while in a relationship with her J as well as the girl would often cut and argue, sometimes things getting violent. J, being 13 at the time and the girl (let's call her h) being 15 explains all of this slightly, since although it is just a 2 year and some difference, in early years of life even 2 years of difference between two people makes many things incredibly varied between the two(psychological maturity, physical maturity, emotional maturity etc.) 

Both J and H had been through a lot of tragedy and trauma for people so young and in turn had become more mature than others their age. However there are always problems with individuals who fit this description (childhood trauma forcing them into a position of more maturity, feel isolated due to their anxieties, intelligence, or what they have been through. They often have a very hard time relating to kids their age and usually end up dating one another rather than mixing in with dissimilar kids.

I fit the bill of this description as well and though I will not be listing any of the things that have happened to me or anyone else mentioned in this post, upon request I will give any information that anyone may find necessary. 

So, to get to the point.

J and I went over to each other's houses, flirted etc. Until I left that summer and moved away. I would often try to help her with her relationship with H although often this was to no avail. We both admitted at this time we found each other very attractive but the most we ever did was excessive kissing.

Skip to October the following year and I start talking with her, now living a couple hours away. 
Before moving I started talking with a friend of hers, (We'll call her B) B and I dated for a couple months before me breaking it off with her due to the fact I could probably make the drive once or twice a month to see her, but her parents would never allow it. 

After we break up I start talking to J again and immediately we hit it off. Talking for hours and hours on Skype everyday, sleeping on the phone together, etc. We confided our problems and solutions in each other and both noted it proved to be extremely therapeutic. Then in January I make a trip to her house since her dad is very chill and spend the night. We end up sleeping together and within a couple weeks she breaks it off with her abusive girlfriend H. At this point H and I hate each other and I despise her for everything she does and she the same to I.


Like I said, I don't want to write too much right now, but if anyone asks I will provide more details.

Fast forward to now, she has cheated on me with H three times but we have worked through it. However after living with her for around 5 months in total we know each other so well it's hard not to feel like there's nothing left to discover or explore or learn about each other. I am also online schooled and this isolates me heavily. I love her very much but this whole thing just feels crazy to me as it feels like no one else our age is able to keep a relationship this long or get to know their s/o as in depth as us. Please leave any advice below."
dating_advice,He still loves another girl.,"I‚Äôve been seeing this friend of mine lately and we both like each other, but he was in love with this girl who wasn‚Äôt interested in him at all.

dating_advice,Ghosted before first date,"Throwaway account, because I'm honestly kinda embarrassed on how hard I'm taking this. 

M32, matched F22 on OKC. We hit it off really well, had an awesome conversation over the course of an evening. Talked on OKC for a couple hours, then moved to Whatsapp. We scheduled a first date within 3 days. She's a medical intern and I understand the workload and schedule that comes with it, esp. in this country (UK). 

I thought she was amazing. She was beautiful, gorgeous even, in that imperfect, girl-next-door kind of  way, not the usual instagram-filter-and-makeup vibe. She had an amazing sense of humor. She was smart, caught all my references, and we kept the conversation going without any effort at all. She was ambitious, but humble, and discouraged me from booking a fancy restaurant, saying she'll go to those once she earns the money to do so herself. She made the conversation sexual later on. I never ever go into the freaky stuff first when meeting someone new, but I didn't exactly resist. Should I have? 

I had indicated early on that I was looking for something serious, and her profile said the same. We talked about our expectations and what we're looking for, and agreed we were a very good match in that department too. 

She was absolutely fucking charming, so we agreed on a time and place for a date. I did my best not to be pushy or needy, but she seemed to reciprocate, so I was excited. She told me she was packing an overnight bag ""in case the date goes well"". I was so fucking stoked... I left it alone for two days, knowing she's on shifts, only messaged her once during that time with a picture of a meal I'd made (she said she liked Mexican). On the day of the date, nothing. I let her know it's not a big deal,  that I knew this happens sometimes, esp. with her profession. I'd left her a few Whatsapp messages last night and today morning, all on the same note, explaining to her I'm not angry or upset in the slightest, and trying to strike up a conversation.  Left on read. At this point I'm pretty sure I'm ghosted, and I have absolutely no idea why. I generally struggle to meet people I click well with and I was really into this girl. What do?"
dating_advice,"I really don‚Äôt want to do this anymore and I feel hopeless, it‚Äôs all futile. I need help","I don‚Äôt want to date anymore, and apps and even in person interactions are making me feel depressed and lonely. 

It‚Äôs futile, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll meet the right person ever and online dating makes me want to either vomit or rip my hair out.

My last relationship really hurt me bad,  and that ended last March. My anxiety and depression have been flaring up on and off for months and I just can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt have the charm and charisma I used to have and I‚Äôm not even 23. I don‚Äôt feel like talking to women when I go out and even when I attempt to online date I either get ghosted or I just don‚Äôt have the motivation for any of it. I have no motivation for any of this anymore and it‚Äôs dragging me down and depressing me 

It does make me sad and I feel like I will be alone because I don‚Äôt know if I can handle it anymore. It‚Äôs just become to frustrating and depressing."
dating_advice,Advice to the person who hasn't dated for years ?,[removed]
dating_advice,"I think I‚Äôm ready, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.","So over the past 2 month or two i‚Äôve been doing a lot of self-reflecting and thinking. Working on myself, so to speak. Loving myself and accepting who I am and what I need. All that stuff. So now I believe I‚Äôm finally ready to get into the dating and romance scene. Over these past 2 months, I‚Äôve turned down every girl who shows interest becuase I just wasn‚Äôt ready, you know? Yeah i‚Äôve made some new friends and gotten them digits and whatever, but nothing more. People have told me they like me, I‚Äôve rejected. People have flittered and complimented me and clearly wanted me to do something, I didn‚Äôt. But as I said, I‚Äôm loving myself now and am ready to try it. I mean i‚Äôm only 20. What could possibly go wrong??

Problem is, I have no idea about any of it lol. Yes I now have the confidence to flirt and get numbers and all that but the actual dating stuff, I‚Äôm clueless on. Girls don‚Äôt intimidate me. They USE to but not anymore. Rejection doesn‚Äôt scare me. God knows i‚Äôve had plenty of that. So how do I start as a 20 year hold who‚Äôs never done this before, in a society that bashes people like me for being ‚Äúbehind‚Äù? Do i just go with the flow and not worry about details? Or are there important things i need to know before starting? Help a brother out here! 


Just a little bit more details, Yes I am quite attractive. And i have the right to say that becuase young and old girls and boys have told me that, family or otherwise. I‚Äôm not jerking my ego off either. Come on now we are all humans we know this stuff is what it is."
dating_advice,Would I be stupid if i asked her out via postcard (details in the description)?," I met this girl last semester, and started to get to know her around november of last year. We really start chatting when we start studying together for the final. In december, around christmas, we meet up twice ""as friends"" for dinner and walk around stores chatting for 2ish hours. We do this before i leave for an out of town internship 10+ hours away. Before school got back in for her we texted, snapchatted a decent bit as well as a couple phone calls and video chats. Some more needed info, she recently broke up with her boyfriend, but she had been planning on doing that since late november early december. Since school started back two weeks ago our conversations went from fairly frequent to about once a day but she is taking a full load of classes as well as a second class in a series she struggled with the first one. I was able to confirm with a mutual friend that the girl in question thinks she likes me.

Now to the actual question. I asked a completely separate friend what I might do and she suggested sending a postcard, and saying something like ""I know we have not known each other for a long time but I am looking forward to being back in birmingham so that I can hopefully spend more time with you (insert girls name here), would you be interested in going on a date when i return?"" I would probably change the wording to make it sound as casual as possible but is the general idea a good one? I also need to add my internship wont end until march 30th roughly so i would not be back home until early april. So would that change when and if i did this?"
dating_advice,Should I make a move,"Sorry if this is long and doesn‚Äôt make much sense but English isn‚Äôt my first language.

So I used to frequent this coffee place that has a really cute waiter (or who I thought was the waiter) since I used it a lot to do homework I stayed there for hours and after a month or so we started to chat a bit I ask for his name and he ask for mine, he asked me what country I was from and stuff like that.

I‚Äôll share some of the exchanges we have had 

-One day after I haven‚Äôt gone to the coffee place for a week he asked me where I have been and after I explained I have given a friend a tour of the city he ask me if I had had fun and was trying to keep the conversation going, on this day he asked me what I was going to do on winter break and I explained I was going back to my country and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna go back I really like it here‚Äù and his reply was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go back, please stay here‚Äù.

- I was with a friend at the coffee shop and we help a group of student do an interview in Spanish, after they left, he waited for my friend to go to the bathroom to talk to me, he wa surprise English wasn‚Äôt my first language (I swear my spoken English is wayyy better than my written) and how smart I most be to be able to speak it so well even tho is not my first language. He did this a lot, every time I went with a friend he will wait for my friend to move away to do small talk 

- Before leaving I went say goodbye to him and his mom (his mom also was very nice to me, by the last few weeks before I left they both kept giving me free coffee, they wouldn‚Äôt let me pay for my usual order) I said goodbye to both of them inside of the coffee place but he walked me outside and said he will miss me and he will count the days until I go back. ( I told him there was a possibility of going back on May but I wasn‚Äôt sure).

So, I actually am going back, but I‚Äôm not sure if he is interested, (I am) like he is really bad at replying my texts, sometimes he takes days or he doesn‚Äôt reply at all. 

I told him I was going back last week and his reply was that he was very happy I was really going back. And today when I started out convo after he left me in read he told me ‚Äúyou will be back in about two week!‚Äù 
 Like aside from those random comments and exchanges he never really has taken initiative, I was the one to ask for his social media and phone number. 

I really like him but I‚Äôm worried I might ruin a nice friendship if I do make a move and he was just being nice.

Edit 
I did notice him not using the phone much or at all while at the coffee shop and I do know he is very busy most of the time..."
dating_advice,Your first love...,Guys of reddit... Is it typical to keep in touch with a girl you once genuinely loved when you have found someone else? How does it make you feel when you have a girl you used to love and a girl you‚Äôre equally attracted to in your life ?

dating_advice,First date hasn't messaged me 24hrs after our date?,"So I'm a 24 F and he's 22 M. We met over a dating app called bumble and basically we hit it off well and he asked for my number and moved over to WhatsApp pretty quickly.  Our replies before 1st date was very slow on his part but this was due to his work and busy life with his hobbies which I understand completely. I didn't ever think anything of it. He asked me for a date for drinks so I agreed to it and we went to a pub and had 3 drinks and it was around 3hrs long the date. 

We talked the whole way through and we laughed and smiled and there was no awkward silences. I could tell he tried flirting but I sort of didn't due to being really anxious and nervous so I feel like my body language might have been off. I had my arms crossed kept twirling my hair but I was so anxious that I broke out in a rash ( I suffer from social anxitey by the way and this was my first ever date)


 I know he said he had a bad date before and said he only had 1 drink because he didn't wanna be there. So if he had 3 with me and 3 hrs must be a good sign right?

But after the date he gave me a hug and walked me to the bus station and said we should do it again and I said yeah I had fun and he said he is glad I had fun.  Yeah since then nothing. 

It just feels so shif because I really wanna what he is thinking about it. I know the not messaging could have been due to working, or doing his busy stuff as he gets up 5am every morning, and I know our messages are not short they're very long.

I don't wanna message first incase he didn't like the date or thought I was ugly or not as good as my pictures, and I look stupid and clingy and desperat.  I don't know what to think or feel the whole situation is making me so anxious.

I think one reason why I want him to text me is for validation more then anything. What are your guys thoughts? Any advice is appreciated"
dating_advice,Help: I couldn‚Äôt keep an erection during first time with new super kind and attractive girl,"I‚Äòm a 26 male, slightly above average T levels, quite sporty and not overweight. Recently I met this new girl (23) and we‚Äôve been dating for a couple weeks now. She is super kind, extremely sporty and fit and attractive to me. What makes her even hotter is that she is a fucking genius. 

During our 7th Date it basically came to intercourse but my boner vanished shortly after putting the condom on and being inside of her. 

I‚Äôve been fapping for most of my life and I pretty much mastered edging (can go multiple days with hour-long edging sessions daily) without cumming. I also tried some moderate sounding but stopped doing that. During masturbating I always noticed how I had to grip my dick quite hard in the beginning to stimulate it enough to get to the first edge and then all I needed was moderate stimulation. 

Anyways, I haven‚Äôt fapped or watched porn since 8days but still couldn‚Äôt keep it up with her. Could this be a mixture of performance anxiety and some porn induced ED? The girl was super understanding and all so we tried again a little later that night but as soon as I was supposed to do something with my dick the erection vanished. What can I do about this? Stay away from porn and masturbation I‚Äôd guess and try to relax more before and during the act?

So then this january I decided to answer one of her stories and again some small talk about upcoming tests. And some time later I finally decided to approach her irl (she always has her friends around so I had always been afraid to) and again we did some small talk.

I texted her once since again (you guessed it, small talk) and yesterday it was her birthday and I went and said happy birthday to her.



I really like her and some advice on how to start dating her sometime would come in very handy ^^"
dating_advice,What's a good place to go on a first date?,"I (female) asked my friend (male) out yesterday, i've liked him ever since i first saw him (almost 3 years ago) and only had the courage to confess to him about my feelings and ask him out yesterday on the nearby park (turns out, he liked me too and was just too reluctant about it because he didn't want to ruin our friendship if i didn't feel the same). We decided that we'll go on a date tomorrow and will plan it out today, but i don't have any suggestions lol. What do you think's a good place to go on a first date? 

any advice/reply will be appreciated, thank you \^.\^"

dating_advice,Is there a switch I can flip?,"TW: of depression and suicide. 

Using a throwaway since this is gonna contain some personal details of both me and him and I don‚Äôt want it linked to my main account. 

It‚Äôs a long one, I‚Äôm both venting and asking for advice. If you want to know context read the whole thing, if not just read the first paragraph below this. 

So I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any ways that can help me get over this seemingly amazing but ‚Äòbroken‚Äô guy? I (21F) just can‚Äôt flip that switch yet in my brain to stop thinking about him.

We got introduced by a mutual friend through message, as we were going to the same NYE party. The platonic chats turned into more and within a week we‚Äôre calling and FaceTiming for hours, messaging nearly every second of the day. We really connected on another level, he told me about his depression, and his recently attempted suicide. He‚Äôs only told his immediate family about this, no friends at all. I‚Äôm the only one not related to him other than his therapist who knows. During the time whilst he was talking to me he got discharged from crisis watch and seemed to be so happy and thanked me for helping him do it. We even said that we loved each other as people. 

I was in Spain on holiday whilst we were talking and he drove 3 hours to pick me up from the airport and then drove me back to my place to then stay with me before we went to the NYE party a few days later. 

The first time we met was amazing it felt so natural and lovely. We had a great first night and spent NYE day together. However during this time we looked at the distance between where we both lived and our work lives which are both beginning to get a bit crazy and decided that we would enjoy the time we were spending together and remain friends afterwards since something could happen in the future. I won‚Äôt lie I was devastated, but was just keen to carry on enjoying our time together before he left to go back home since he was leaving on New Years Day. 

Fast forward to midnight we have our kiss and everything is great at the party, then later on I see him upset and staring off into space. I take him round to our mutual friends house since they live next door to the party. I tried to talk to him but he wouldn‚Äôt let me know what he thinking and when comforting him he kept saying that he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äòhurt‚Äô me and that he was going to ‚Äòruin‚Äô me. I was assuring him that wasn‚Äôt going to happen when he got mad and left the room. I spent about half an hour crying waiting for him to come back down. When he finally did I told him that I was going to be there for him no matter what and that I was worried for him. He told me to stop caring about him as he didn‚Äôt deserve it and he‚Äôd only mess me up. 

He then said we should get back to the party. I said that I didn‚Äôt feel like being there anymore and was going to get a taxi back to my place, that he was welcome to join or if he wanted to go back to party and come back to mine later thats fine too. He refused to let me leave alone and came back with me. After sleeping on it we both apologised in the morning and talked about it and he left mine on seemingly good grounds. 

Since the weeks that we last saw each other we‚Äôve been messaging a lot still. Not as much as before but still often. For the first week of messaging it was still very sexual, until I said that if we were going to be friends we can‚Äôt be doing anything else. Which he agreed to, we followed this for a day or two and then went back to our old ways. I brought it up again after two weeks and we‚Äôve now been just platonic.

Throughout these weeks where we‚Äôve been platonic he had another mental health relapse and thought about killing himself again, he didn‚Äôt try to this time thankfully and got himself checked into a hospital. I again other than his family am the only one who knows this. He got back out after a day or so. As well as his mental health relapsing, he also recently relapsed with drugs. He took cocaine the other night, which I‚Äôm pretty sure I only know about. Whilst messaging him I haven‚Äôt been getting a lot of effort from him and am having to message first a lot of the time. I brought it up and he responded saying that he‚Äôs putting all of his effort into surviving right now.

I‚Äôm so worried for him, I‚Äôm trying to check in to make sure he doesn‚Äôt do anything stupid whilst still trying to figure out what he wants me to do. But as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve guessed I still really like him romantically and still want there to be a potential future even though I doubt it will happen. It would be so much easier if we just cut all contact but I still want to know him as a person even if it‚Äôs just as friends.

At this point I can‚Äôt see myself being able to cope with all of this if he doesn‚Äôt let me in because I‚Äôm just constantly worrying about what he‚Äôll do next and whether I should message first or give him his space, blah blah blah. What do I do? Is there an easy way to help you detach from romantic feelings? I think if I didn‚Äôt have them it would be a bit easier to deal with this whole malarky since I‚Äôd just care as a friend rather than something more."

dating_advice,Am i setting myself up for failure?,"These past 5 months of college have been the one of the most confusing period if my life so far. Im (21M) and met this girl (20F) who caught i serious feelings for.

Ive had little to no experience with girls before i even came to college and so this was all pretty new to me.  Then met this girl in my class, she‚Äôs gorgeous, funny and kind, i didn‚Äôt think of it too much i was just like oh fair, just a small crush. But as the weeks progressed we‚Äôd get matched up in groups, basically formed a little group of friends from our class who‚Äôd we‚Äôd hang around with, we both got elected class reps and just spending more time with her in general. This was when i seriously started to catch feelings.

Now we‚Äôd also constantly go out to clubs every week with our group of friends and one night we were just dancing and out of the blue it was just me and her, we got talking and next thing you know we were kissing, bam. I was in fucking ecstasy when this happend, i was just happy. But at the end of the night she was feeling sick so i just walked her home, got a takeaway, held her hair when she puked and put her to bed and went home.

Now this was when things started to be a little confusing for me, i did tell her i liked her, we had a conversation about it, we had a proper DMC and i found out stuff about her she never told anyone, she also said that she just got out of her first serious relationship which was pretty toxic and didnt know if she was ready for commitment again and that was okay with me because she needed space, i didnt want to force anything or break our friendship so we decided to keep it neutral between us.

But now every night out now, her other friends would bombard me with stuff like ‚Äòyou should get with her‚Äô and ‚Äòstay right here im gonna go get ‚Äòher name‚Äô‚Äô. I dont really pay much attention to it because i know where me and her stand, but recently, the girl im talking about would tease me and get with me on nights out again and say stuff like ‚Äòi feel selfish because you want a relationship and i don‚Äôt think i could‚Äô, but would continue to get with me on nights out? But i just cant do it, I‚Äôve realised I‚Äôm not the one night stand type of person and she knows that, when she does this, it kind of just fucks with my head it would seriously bother me. I know its wrong that i keep getting with her as well but fuck, i‚Äôve got serious feelings for this girl it just overrides my thought process.

Am i just gonna fuck myself in the long run? What should i do in this situation, call her out nicely on it? Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated."
dating_advice,Too scared of letting something happen,"So, the title sums it up pretty much.

I am 18 years old, female and totally inexperienced when it comes to guys and the whole dating thing. I‚Äôve gone on some dates when I was like 14-16 years old but I‚Äôve never had a relationship because it never worked out at all.

Now that I am at university, I talk to even more guys who are my age or slightly older than me and it‚Äôs cool! I was mostly friends with other shy and inexperienced girls at high school and we never really went out to meet new people or anything like that, so when I hang out with my new friends I often feel like I‚Äôve missed out on a lot.

I am too awkward and kind of anxious when it comes to (subtle) flirting and I wish it would stop. I really want to be more chill and confident but I don‚Äôt know how to change that about myself. I already got approached by several guys at university and clubs but I couldn‚Äôt really go further than that because something was always holding me back. 

Whenever a guy approaches me, I feel like he‚Äôs only kidding or maybe he‚Äôs just being nice, so I didn‚Äôt really show much interest back.

Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you!"

dating_advice,Do I [30f] follow up on interest from [m18],"As the topic states. Sorry for bad formatting, on mobile and throwaway.
Little wall of text- Sorry!

So I (30f) work in a hotel/bar and one of the younger lads (18m)  from the kitchen has shown more than a friendly interest, we get on well and have a few things in common, gaming and some tv series, etc.  Both have had a pretty bad (most recent) ex and have kind of bonded over that too.

I know it's a huge age gap and definitely at different stages in life. He lives with parents and I own my house and live alone..

To put in comparison my dating life has basically been the real life version of the movie Good Luck Chuck- so far without the ending lol! 9/10 of my exes are engaged/married/living with the one after me...

I've had a rethink about what I want the last year or so and I've come up with the conclusion that I'm not going to try and force myself into the ""this needs to be a relationship"" mindset.
Each time theres a night out with the work group (ages 18-40,) we both attend and generally have a good night, there has been more flirting recently, have known each other for about 7 months now.

Just looking for a bit of reddit advice on what to do, cause I keep going round in circles.

Tdlr: m18 colleague showing more than friendly interest, we get on well, hes cute but wayyyyyyy younger than me 30f. Do I break that barrier?"

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn‚Äôt slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don‚Äôt understand if she‚Äôs losing interest shouldn‚Äôt she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

dating_advice,What do I do if all of her friends say if we look cute and would make a great couple?,"So I play tennis, and I play with girl. She looks good, though I would never think of her as anything more than friends. But I get consistently get messages on social media from heaps of her friends saying that we would ""look cute"" and ""make a cute couple"". Whilst I would usually, ignore no that and think of it as a joke, it's not one, not two, but five of her friends telling me that. And it wasn't just a one time thing. I get it one a weekly basis. So, I am think that my friend from tennis has told her friends something that has got then to suggest that. Am I being to dramatic or am I being realistic?"
dating_advice,LDR plan could fall apart?,"The plan was that I'll get a scholarship, at least university in Florida. That's where she is, but I'm in England. I'm 18 years old, and I love this girl more than anything. I would do anything for her and the thought of her or being with her has always brought such a euphoria to my mind.

I applied to 3 places so far, and I received my first rejection. I've been rejected from 3 high-end universities in the UK so far and I don't know how to feel: whether I should prepare for the worst or hope for the best: as I have been doing for the past 1.5 years. We have a whole life planned.. I don't have SAT results, or the money to get my grades evaluated so that cuts a lot of my options, especially since ant new applications are regular decision or rolling admissions.

I'm applying to more universities in the US, and calling or emailing countless places. But if university isn't my ticket to a life with her in such a beautiful place then what is? How else can I get there, and make this work?

I can't stand it here. I hate my city with a passion, and the rest of the country generally doesn't fit me, it hurts to feel trapped here. My family is awful and I need to escape, it's a whole new life out there and I want to start it with her, as does she.

Surely there must be another way, right? If it's not university, what can it be? How long must we wait?

I'm sorry for how sporadic this post is, I'm just really emotional and tired right now. Thank you so much for reading, and I really appreciate any advice or hope."
dating_advice,What do you do when you think you might like a friend romantically?,"I‚Äôm (21f) starting to catch feelings for my really close guy friend (20m), after being friends for 4 years and his (physical and emotional) glow up over the last year. Every now and then I think I‚Äôve picked up on flirting or mixed signals, but honestly not totally sure. We‚Äôre both super reserved people so it‚Äôs a guessing game at the moment. 

I really really enjoy his friendship though, and am scared to jeopardize it by a romantic relationship. Right now I don‚Äôt know if he is even attracted to me and am scared of letting myself like him to only get rejected. (I‚Äôve had an unlucky streak of being turned down by the last 3 guys I‚Äôve developed feelings for)

How do you approach these situations and determine if you‚Äôll move forward toward a romantic relationship? How do you get past the scariness of it all? I‚Äôve only ever been in one relationship and that was when I was 15."
dating_advice,Opinions on partying while in a relationship (w/out your significant other)?,"I‚Äôve been on &amp; off with my current boyfriend for about a year now &amp; partying has always been an issue , I was just wondering what your guys thoughts are on going out with out your partner as I personally think I should be able to go out with my girlfriends with out having to argue about it every time."
dating_advice,"Vent/Confessions: Hoping to rekindle an old flame in the near future, while being sure to remain realistic of my expectations/anticipations.","Jumping right to it. For starters, ‚ÄúR‚Äù (25F) and I (24M) fell in love the fall of 2018. We had the most dream-like time together for just a few months before she left the country for a year-long work contract, which was regrettably, already a plan set in stone before we met. 

Looking back, especially after having had a year to reflect on myself and our relationship, there are things I would‚Äôve done differently while we were together such as:
1) not being so camera-shy when she wanted to take or post photos of us on social media because in a way it was a love language of hers, and at the time I hadn‚Äôt 100% healed from a previous heartbreak that left me hesitant to be more open about a fun little thing as that, 
2) not being so outwardly critical of the relationships in her life, particularly friendships that I saw were somewhat toxic, because the decision of choosing who we keep in our lives is solely our own for our own reasons,
3) being EXTRA careful, cautious, and conscious (even more than I already had been) of how past traumas affect her to this day‚ÄîR was molested as a child and we sometimes had difficulty being intimate because of it. I always made sure to console her or just hug her real tight when she‚Äôd have an episode of anxiety or was triggered. 

You can see, these things I would‚Äôve done differently are all over the spectrum in gravity from super-serious to lighthearted.

And the list also goes on, because I‚Äôm flawed to the core and a year later my biggest regret is not having made my affections for R as unconditional as I possibly could have. 

After we broke up last August due to long distance and neither of us doing well with our inner selves by that point (a long winded story in itself) I rebounded, or made the mistake of allowing myself to latch onto another soul without having fully healed or had time to completely reflect. My ego let me think that I was so fine without R, that my past was behind me and life should begin anew. 

Obviously at that point in time, it hurt R to know that that was my mindset at that point in time, that I was fine without her. I had been wrong about everything, about thinking that I was fine or even better off without her. I tried to ask for her back, but we agreed to give each other space until she returned, which probably made the most sense because of the ongoing long-distance. 

So the last several months I‚Äôve spent reflecting have made me realize that R is the one who I simply, just want to *do* life with. I miss everything about her. I think we balanced each other out very well, like that old saying that goes ‚ÄúHe becomes her strength, while she becomes his weakness.‚Äù She definitely makes me weak. Her wide smile, her laugh, her softness.

I am prepared for her return at the end of next month, and plan on being completely transparent with telling her everything that has happened, how I fucked up by latching onto someone else who I ended up hurting anyway in the end because I hadn‚Äôt fully healed, how I regret initiating our break up, how I was a sick fool to believe that we were better off not being together. I‚Äôm not trying to be self-deprecating, but honest with my regret, sorrow, and guilt. 

I suppose we may meet again when she is ready, or perhaps she may never be willing to see me again. But I have to be okay with and understanding of that possibility. I don‚Äôt know where her mind is at this point in time, because we haven‚Äôt spoken. But she‚Äôs coming back. Hopefully, she‚Äôll come back to me.

Thanks for reading. I haven‚Äôt had much time to vent to another human being lately so I‚Äôve felt some relief just spilling it all to you lovely people.

Wish me luck. I shouldn‚Äôt like to think my chances of getting her back are very high."
dating_advice,my brothers friend stole my girl,"for context: im 22, my brother is 13 and my brother‚Äôs friend is also 13.

this girl came to my house and my little brother invited his friend over to play Mario kart. so im in my room with this girl watching Netflix and this kid comes to borrow one of my joy cons and sees this girl and me laying on the bed.

anyways, he starts giving me a hard time, talking shit about the show we were watching. We were watching this documentary and he says I know yoda_pimp chose this show because only nerds watch documentaries and she started laughing. Then he said make a damn move already right in front of her. she starts giggling really hard and I say have you even held a girls hand yet. So then he walks over to my girl and holds her hand and says like this? I Reach over to take his hands off her and he pulls their hands away, kind of like when someone is handing you something and they pull their hands away before you grab it. 

so after a couple of times I go to reach her other hand to pull her away to leave the house, but shes resisting me. I start walking towards the door and I say come on let‚Äôs go get something to eat, but she keeps on lying in the bed while holding his hand. He looks at me and smirks and asks her if she played Mario Kart before. She giggled and says yeah but only a couple of times. then he says he‚Äôll teach her how to play and they go downstairs. 

I‚Äôm furious right now. I left the house because I‚Äôm so mad. I‚Äôve been lifting for a year and I thought I‚Äôve been improving but then this crap happens. What the hell could I have done?"

dating_advice,Should I make a move ?,"Sorry if this is long and doesn‚Äôt make much sense but English isn‚Äôt my first language.

So I used to frequent this coffee place that has a really cute waiter (or who I thought was the waiter) since I used it a lot to do homework I stayed there for hours and after a month or so we started to chat a bit I ask for his name and he ask for mine, he asked me what country I was from and stuff like that.

I‚Äôll share some of the exchanges we have had 

-One day after I haven‚Äôt gone to the coffee place for a week he asked me where I have been and after I explained I have given a friend a tour of the city he ask me if I had had fun and was trying to keep the conversation going, on this day he asked me what I was going to do on winter break and I explained I was going back to my country and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna go back I really like it here‚Äù and his reply was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go back, please stay here‚Äù.

- I was with a friend at the coffee shop and we help a group of student do an interview in Spanish, after they left, he waited for my friend to go to the bathroom to talk to me, he wa surprise English wasn‚Äôt my first language (I swear my spoken English is wayyy better than my written) and how smart I most be to be able to speak it so well even tho is not my first language. He did this a lot, every time I went with a friend he will wait for my friend to move away to do small talk 

- Before leaving I went say goodbye to him and his mom (his mom also was very nice to me, by the last few weeks before I left they both kept giving me free coffee, they wouldn‚Äôt let me pay for my usual order) I said goodbye to both of them inside of the coffee place but he walked me outside and said he will miss me and he will count the days until I go back. ( I told him there was a possibility of going back on May but I wasn‚Äôt sure).

So, I actually am going back, but I‚Äôm not sure if he is interested, (I am) like he is really bad at replying my texts, sometimes he takes days or he doesn‚Äôt reply at all. 

I told him I was going back last week and his reply was that he was very happy I was really going back. And today when I started out convo after he left me in read he told me ‚Äúyou will be back in about two week!‚Äù 
 Like aside from those random comments and exchanges he never really has taken initiative, I was the one to ask for his social media and phone number. 

I really like him but I‚Äôm worried I might ruin a nice friendship if I do make a move and he was just being nice."

dating_advice,Sparking an old relationship with a girl i never dated - is it worth it?,"I just finished high school last month and decided to hit up one of the first girls i ever really had a crush on. I met her towards the end of middle school leading into high school. we would talk every day over snap and text, but she wasn‚Äôt in any of my classes and i rarely saw her in person; Making the situation hard to manage. We eventually stopped talking once high school started since i moved away for a year. When i came back she had a boyfriend and seemed to have moved on. It made me upset because friends were telling me she really liked me and so on, but i was always too nervous to make a move. Therefore for the next 3 years i moved on as well. But out of some inkling i decided to give it another shot, and it‚Äôs been going well so far. It‚Äôs as if we never stopped talking in the first place, it feels great. She doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend anymore so i was wondering if my chances of success r high now?"

dating_advice,Girlfriend hide me from her friend.,"Me \[28\] wants to know her\[26\]. However she refuse to even mention me to her bff which stays in another country. I tried to dig around for clues.

Her friend had another friend who got a girlfriend and she complained to my gf that when her friend started dating, he ditched her for her new friend. I feel like my gf is scared that she will feel the same way about me.

About two weeks prior, we had discussed the option of sharing a bed and sleeping and he said it wasn‚Äôt a good idea because we wanted to take things slow. Things that gotten somewhat physical about a week ago, so I figured it would be okay to sleep with him. That was 100% my intention. But, then he got hard spooning me and things went very quickly.

He didn‚Äôt seem like he was even going to kiss me goodbye (unlike him). He was extremely tired. As was I. The car ride felt a bit awkward at times. We haven‚Äôt talked much today as he had school and then work. But he did mention to me he wants to talk.

dating_advice,Where and when to meet women?,"I'm a decent looking guy \[33m\], 150lbs, 5,9, with a great shape, well  defined muscles, low body fat, that dresses well but I'm not photogenic  and I don't have nice photos so online dating and that kind of stuff  doesn't work at all for me. I don't go to bars/clubs because I don't  drink and due to certain circumstances I lost/cut contact with the  people I used to go out with. When I went to bars/clubs the music was  just too loud so talking was really difficult and it was overcrowded. I  didn't have a good time and it was probably evident. I live in one of  Canada's largest city and it's pretty cold so stepping outside for a  chat is a hassle as you have to get your coat, then outside you get  shivery, etc. I really don't know where to start. When I see a woman I'd  like to talk to it's mostly on the public transport and I'm a little  shy...

I see this girl almost every day in the school cafeteria. I want to talk to her, but I‚Äôm not sure how to go about doing so. If she were sitting alone, I think I could do it, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to happen at all. How can I talk to her while she has friends around? My first instinct is to just walk up to her and say something like ‚ÄúHey, I see you here all the time and I just wanted to let you know that I think you have the most amazing smile‚Äù. Potential problems with that are: I may be coming on too strong, I may be just making a fool out of myself with that, and if I were to say that, what do I do after? Do I just say that and leave? Stick around and wait for a response? Ask for her number? I‚Äôm just lost here and would appreciate any advice y‚Äôall are willing to offer. 

Thank you in advance."
dating_advice,Girlfriend asked to be choked,"Not to long ago my girlfriend and I were getting ""frisky"" to say the least.

Me being a male raised by a strong single mom, and hearing all of her teaching on how to treat women, I have never thought of the idea of choking anyone during sex.

dating_advice,Why does it feel like women aren't interested in me?,"Hey y'all. I (24m) recently graduated college and while there I found that although people found me generally pleasant enough, few women seemed interested in me romantically/sexually. I'm not sure if this was a commuter student thing or a class thing (I went to a middle class centric university and I'm lower middle class). Maybe it was just bad luck. I'm good looking, take care of myself, dress reasonably well, in good shape, have a good haircut (hope this doesn't  come off as a humble brag), and I'm 5'11"". Also, I'm reasonably interesting (at least as much as the average person) and I have good social manners. 

However, I've found a good amount of women I've interacted with and hoped to ask out/was interested in never seem to view me that way. I'm not the greatest at flirting but I'm not terrible either and I' certainly made an active effort over the years to meet women but I've often gotten the vibe that they're no interest in me.

Could anyone here please provide me with some insight or advice on how to do better and be seen a viable sexual option by women? Rn it seems like I'm bound to be a pleasant acquaintance. Maybe I'm just stupid though"

dating_advice,How do I distract myself from finding a relationship?,"I'm a junior in college (straight female) and I know that the next few years of my life will be turbulent and being single will make things easier. My brain knows this, but my heart doesn't seem to quite get it. 

I have a full life, with two part time jobs, an internship, and full-time course load. I engage in community service when I can and have a lot of friends. I go to the gym four times a week and am very proud of my figure (25% body fat, regularly curl 20lbs and do cardio and all that). I schedule regular ""me"" time, since I seem to have a high libido. 

However, I still have this yearning for a relationship. Is there any way I can get rid of this, or do I just have to deal with it? It's so hard when people around you have people they love romantically and you don't.

dating_advice,Why was it so painful to break things off with a friends with benefits?,"I (20 F) just broke off a friends with benefits-type relationship (20 M) and I‚Äôm really hurting. We had both gotten out of two and three year relationships in September and started talking in late November. We started seeing each other consistently for the entirety of January and I was super happy with him. We met on Tinder. We slept together on our first date and we agreed that we felt an instant, genuine connection. He said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship on our first date, but I took it lightly and thought he could change his mind. We‚Äôre both in college, so he went home to another state for a 3-4 week long break and we still talked ALL the time. We became each other‚Äôs best friends in snapchat, we FaceTimed multiple times a day and were always texting throughout the day. I started to become attached and he was too. Then, as soon as school started up, he said he wanted to create more boundaries and said we should talk/see each other less and I was hurt because I got attached and got too comfortable. 

Cut to today. I felt like we had reached the ‚Äúwhat are we‚Äù stage in our situation, so I wanted to have a serious and honest conversation about where we each saw this going. I wanted a relationship, he didn‚Äôt. He said he wants to be single for at least another year.  What made this so hard is that he was sending me mixed signals the entire time and it confused me a lot. We agreed that we can definitely leave the door open for a relationship in the future in the unlikely chance that we‚Äôll cross paths again (we go to different schools in the same city). I guess this is so painful because we had such an intense connection and were intimate for such a short amount of time. Why am I hurting more than when I broke up with my ex of 2 years? Now I‚Äòm starting to think that I want to be single for a while, as I haven‚Äôt been truly single since I was 16. 

Any advice for how to move from this and not immediately get into another relationship?"

I know she had some rough teenage years and used to smoke weed and tried other things, but says she hasn‚Äôt in 4-5 years now. I am worried about someone trying to steal to get drug money.

He is very empathetic and if I‚Äôm completely honest, he‚Äôs one of the only people that I feel genuinely respected by.  Recently however, I‚Äôve been feeling a lot stronger towards him. This could be because of two reasons, I recently turned eighteen and am feeling a little bolder, or because weve been spending more time together because the sport I‚Äôm in that he coaches just began. 

I was s**ually a*used in the last relationship I was in a few years ago and haven‚Äôt been in a relationship since. I am slightly worried that this crush might be me chasing after decency and disguising it as attraction. But when he‚Äôs showing us a certain lift and I can see his back muscles through his shirt, or when he puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes after a hard workout, or smiles at one of my jokes... I can‚Äôt help but think about how much I care about him and how much I enjoy his presence... 

He has never been inappropriate towards me, or anyone else for that matter. I would never try anything at school because I wouldn‚Äôt want to jeopardize his career. And Even though I most likely will not make a move, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him...

dating_advice,How should I [22M] move forward with [20F]?,"Hello, I‚Äôd appreciate some advice on how to move forward with an interest of mine.

For context, I‚Äôm a senior in college and she‚Äôs a junior. I met her two years ago through a campus group, but we didn‚Äôt begin to seriously talk until about two months ago. We ran into each other at a party a couple of weeks ago, and we had a drunken conversation in which we agreed that we should hang out more. A few days later, we hung out and played some video games in my room, we had a nice conversation but nothing romantic was addressed. I invited her to a party last weekend, but it had a weird vibe so we went back to my room again and watched some Netflix. We had a very deep conversation in which she discussed her family and some of her anxieties, but again, nothing romantic was discussed. Part of this is my fault, as I never explicitly told her my expectations from the start.

We text occasionally, but she takes an hour or two to respond and our text conversations tend to be pretty short.

I invited her to a movie tomorrow, and she accepted.  I want to try to move things forward in a romantic way if the movie goes well. I really like being with this girl, she‚Äôs really genuine and funny. 

How should I let her know about my intentions/invite her on a proper date?"

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go as far as messaging her very soon even if she accepts, but I still am concerned that I‚Äôm crossing some sort of boundary.

dating_advice,Post first time anal,"So, my GF who is much younger than me and I got really drunk the other night. We had talked about neither of us doing anal before, but nothing really happened for months.  I didn't bring it up or push the issue.  Mainly because I told her I didn't think I was into anal.  Basically, I didn't think I would be into it and she claimed she never did it for the same reason.  I did buy some lube from amazon (astroglide), but that was about as close to discussing it as we went.

Anyway, last night, we got pretty trashed and I suddenly thought it was a good idea.  She said yes and we had anal sex.  Honestly, it was more fun than I imagined and I think it was because of a taboo feeling.  Afterwards, I asked her and she said she was surprised that she liked it, but then the next day complained that it hurt.  

So, I'm still on the fence as to whether or not I'm a fan of anal sex.  However, I think I would like to try it out while not totally drunk.  I've brought it up casually a couple of times today and she ignores the question.  

So, do I just go silent and wait for her to bring it up?  I think so.  I think since last night was my idea I should wait for her to suggest it next time.

We hit it off pretty good and we talked about when im coming down to visit family for Christmas. We hung out a lot and i asked her out a couple days before i had to fly back with the knowledge of me moving back with my mom when social services get it all sorted. When we started dating she told me she doesn‚Äôt really like long distance relationships but she would date me because we both thought i would be moving back within 3 months. After i got back i found out i wouldnt be able to live with my mom because of my sisters probation violations (shes 14). I havent told my girlfriend this yet but she was saying that she loved me (im homeschooled so we talk almost all day) and she would wait the 6 months for me to be 18 if she had to. The thing is is that i got drunk one night and called her talking about she would probably leave me if she had to wait the 6 months and she said probably bit i dont know if she was joking or not (we both have a really weird sense of humor) but a couple days ago she was telling me she would wait. How can i make her happy throughout these next 6 months? Im honestly tempted to tell her she can have sex with other dudes if thats what it would take as it wouldn‚Äôt bother me if it was just sex.

dating_advice,Why am I having second guesses on this guy?,"I had a great first dinner date with a dude I met online. He was extremely kind and we had great conversation and a lot in common. Just about flipped when I found out he was a pot head like me too.

So when he planned the next date out, I kinda wanted to get high with him so I invited over instead and we skipped the date. Long story short he got extremely high (almost like he never smoked before) and was just very socially awkward/nervous and not fun to be around. He felt like a different person to me. We ended up going to a movie and it was very awkward... he tried making a move on me in the theater and it failed miserably. Then at the end of the date we made out a little outside my house and he didn‚Äôt try to advance it further.

Overall, I‚Äôm just left feeling like the chemistry we had was almost faked on the first date and it showed on the second that we aren‚Äôt truly compatible...but at the same time I really liked the time we had at dinner. Don‚Äôt know what to do now, I‚Äôm very confused."

dating_advice,Strong initial connection with bumble date but now distant before nice double date. What should I do?," 

I (24m) had a really strong connection on bumble with this one girl (24f). We went on a first date that went really well, we got food and drinks, then went to an arcade and played some VR games. I felt a strong connection and felt comfortable with a nice second date.

She was enthusiastic about a second date and even got involved in planning. My friend and his wife were going to a nice standup comedy event so I bough two tickets next to them and we planned a whole evening for the 4 of us.

This was a week out and our date is now in two days. I‚Äôve noticed that our texting has become infrequent and a lot shorter than our conversations initially. We‚Äôre down to a few texts a day.

So since we‚Äôre going to spend an evening at a show and a nice restaurant, should I send her a double text or something to see what‚Äôs going on? Maybe to ask her what she is using bumble for? I don‚Äôt want to go into the night thinking this is going anywhere if she‚Äôs already lost interest."

&amp;#x200B;

We've been on 3 dates and he invited me to his friends house party so I've met some of his friends. We've kissed a few times (granted we were very drunk) and twice we've cuddled up listening to music till the early hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I feel like he's all I can think about and I've stopped looking for or talking to anybody else which makes think I might be falling for him.

dating_advice,How to get over a girl I asked out but had to stop being friends with?,"I asked a girl out from work that I see everyday. She told me she has a boyfriend. That's cool so I backed off. But she wanted to be friends, so I reciprocated. This was stupid of me because I just developed feelings for her and wanted to ask her out more.

At this point I decided to tell her I can't be friends with her. She has the right to not to reject my date offer, just as I have a right not to accept her friendship.

In that sense, everything is fine.

She is clearly pissed off that I told her we didn't want to be friends. She won't even look me in the eye. We cross paths frequently and she just puts a stern look on and looks straight ahead, purposely making sure not to look at me. Which is totally OK - she doesn't owe me anything.

But everyday I almost break in and apologize to her and tell her we can still be friends just so I can talk to her again. I know that will just put me back where I started though, in a frustrating position that I cannot do anything about. The thing I hate the most is knowing that I hurt her.

‚ÄúHey, you asked me if I was ok earlier. I am, but I just got on Zelda Breath of the Wild. Thought of XXXX, and I‚Äôve just been staring at the floor after I turned if off. She would text me while I spent 200 hours in that game. I don‚Äôt say I feel sadness, I feel nothing. I just don‚Äôt get the point of forming romantic relationships with people anymore. Why risk caring about someone so much, just for them to leave with another dude they were talking to for four months? I just don‚Äôt see the risk-reward being worth it. I wish I was a psychopath who couldn‚Äôt feel empathy or attachment. I already fear losing YYYY and its only been a month since we met. I fear losing you. I fear losing everyone. But why do it if the risk is self-inflicted emotional harm? Idk, this is what I meant by sorting out things I haven‚Äôt thought about in a while. Thank you for always being there for me bro. I still want to go clubbing, or to a bar sometime üíô‚Äù

So why have romantic relationships? Why do YOU have them?

**TLDR:** I‚Äôm struggling to justify forming romantic relationships to myself. Why have them? Why do YOU have them?"
dating_advice,Just want to vent and ask for advice,So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and 8 months about. We've recently just kinda got a point where we realized we have nothing in common.  And Shes not really into anything other than work. Shes never had hobbies or anything shes enjoyed. Now this was a problem in the beginning too. But she said she'd work on it as well. Buttt here we are. I'm feeling shitty cause I do not want to wait for another year just to find out oh yeah we dont work. But i really do like her. And I would be extremely sad if we broke up. I want it to work. So recently she said shes going to try again. To find stuff she enjoys or hobbies or anything.  So we'll see. I guess more of a rant and a vent. Has anyone else experienced this? Or have advice? (Also extremely new to this place on the internet. ) Thanks people.

dating_advice,How is the best way to a girl to hit inherit crush?,"First I would to apologize for my English as it is my second language! Also, I‚Äôm on mobile.

So, I met this guy in my college. He is cute, friends with some friends of mine but, other than that, I have 0 contact with him other than some ‚Äúhi‚Äôs‚Äù here and there.

I already had some interest in him but nothing major to the point I would do something about it. It was like more of a ‚Äúif I ever get a chance I will not let it pass‚Äù.

December last year we went to a party and my chance came! We ended up hooking up a bit, just kissing. 

But let me tell, I will never forget this kiss in my life. It was just like the way I like it.

So now, obviously, I want him. Like, reeealy want him. So much. But still, we do not started chatting after the party.

A little bit of context. Since I‚Äôm from Brasil, it‚Äôs kinda of normal here for you to kiss people without being in some kind of pre-relationship or whatever is the word that i can‚Äôt remember right now.

My class will start on 10 of February and I would like to know what would be the a nice way to get to know him more and maybe see if he would like to go on dates and that‚Äôs stuff!

Important information it‚Äôs that we do not go to classes together as I‚Äôm in a more advanced semester than him.

Other important information is that I‚Äôm a big coward in my life. But I‚Äôm willing to put myself forward and give it a shot, not nothing suuuper major like declare myself as soon as i ser him.

Please help!!!"
dating_advice,"Do I reach out, and how?","I (23M) got a bumble account the other day as suggested by my best friend (28F). I thought/ think it's kinda dumb, but... I was swiping through and saw a friend (23F) of mine from several years ago. We flirted here and there and talked some back in the day, but I couldn't ever get ""close"" enough to her to try and make a move because a d-bag I know kept getting kept intentionally getting in the way because he thought he had better chances with her than I did and he was trying to snuff me out. She eventually ended up moving away for college and I never saw more heard from her again. Well, I saw her on bumble today. She moved back, but I have to wait and see if she stopped me and we match.

dating_advice,I don‚Äôt know if this girl likes me or not and I really want to make sure I know so I don‚Äôt make a bad decision.,"So I am fairly young (M 14) and I really like this girl. I have been trying to build our relationship recently, and just the other day we had a class field trip where we had lots of interactions and most were us teasing each other. Obviously this seems like a tell tale sign but at school or around certain people she seems less social or just talks to me less. It seems like when we‚Äôre alone ig she is very interested in me, but i‚Äôm just stuck up on the fact that she doesn‚Äôt talk to me as much during school. She also hangs out and talks to a lot of other guys and idk if i‚Äôm the only one so its tough for me to decide."
dating_advice,She (17f) stalked my (17m) twitter and found out that I called another girl hot,"Few months ago, I came across a tweet that insulted the daughter of one of the famous guys in my country. I replied to that tweet ""The girl's hot"". But if you'd seen the girl you'd decide she was objectively good looking. I love my girlfriend, no other female is attractive to my eyes. And even in the future none other will be attractive to my eyes. Attractive and looking good are two separate things. So, she got jealous and sent me pictures of guys she finds hot. The guys were literally top tier male models, and she sent me a picture of a guy that does some Instagram modelling and called him ""the most handsome kid in our country"".

 Now, I've done modeling in the past and still get offers, and in real life standards you could say I'm an attractive guy who had zero problems with his looks. So, that was not a problem of mine, and I told her ""want me to send you a picture of a girl that's really hot?"", she said yes. And I sent her her own picture. And she asked me ""okay, and do you want me to send you pictures of a guy I really find hot?"" I said sure, you can send me pictures. And she kept sending me pictures of another guys. I wasn't really disturbed or jealous, but my heart hurt a little. Not because of she found those guys ""hot"", that would be something I'd be disturbed about in the past. But I don't know why, it just hurt man. What should I do? I love her a lot, am I just pretending like I'm not seeing the red flags? Or would you have done the same she's done? She has no problems with her looks, she doesn't look bad and has no insecurities about it. But me calling another girl hot offended her I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

P/S: I don't know if I should include this but here we go, I have a hidden picture album in my phone. This album consists of male models like Francisco Lachowski, David Gandy, Jordan Barrett, Sean O'Pry, Jon Kortajarena, Atesh Salih, Lucky Blue Smith, Matt Bomer, Jeremy Meeks. Whenever I get bored, I type in the password and get access to the album, and I look at their pictures while being amazed of how aesthetic they are. Might this be why I had no problem by looking at the pictures of hot guys she sent me?"

dating_advice,Should I try online dating?,"So I'm 19F, and I've never been in a relationship. I got close around a year ago, but we were in the talking phase for a few weeks and I realized it wasn't gonna work out. I know I'm still young and that it's not the most abnormal thing, but my family looks at me like I'm a hermit. I really don't have any friends, and I think that's a big part of the problem. I work full-time and go to school full-time, so I really don't have much of a chance to get involved on campus and make friends. All of my high school friends dumped me for some unknown reason halfway through senior year. In my situation, is it worth it to try online dating? Who knows, maybe I just need someone to talk to. I'm just so freaking lonely all the time. I've asked my therapist about this and all the advice he had to offer was ""Well, you should be proud of yourself for working so hard"". Having pride in what I'm doing doesn't change the fact that the only thing I have to do on a Friday night is homework."
dating_advice,Fear and anxiety over girl wanting me?,"24m. So I recently entered the dating pool again and started getting matches on tinder and bumble. I hit it off with this girl and we have fun texting, and she keeps saying we should hangout, she really wants to take me out and also expressed interest in having sex too. Every time I get her texts I get this anxiety and fear.

I have no idea why, like Im gonna fuck it up or be too awkward or not know what to talk about or not be good enough or something. I'm pretty insecure about my inexperience with sex and women in general and hate to disappoint people, it makes me so nervous.

Like anyone would be stoked to have a girl so obviously interested in them, and in theory i was, but now that its happening its so daunting. I cant stop feeling this way and I dont know why. Im not scared of commitment or anything, in fact I really want a girlfriend, which makes it even more confusing."
dating_advice,How do I flirt/pick up on flirting as a guy?,"I cannot pick up on flirting whatsoever. A girl could literally probably come up to me and kiss me and I'd still probably think she's just being nice. Whenever a girl does flirt with me I freeze up and just get awkward and don't know what to say or do. How do I pick up on hints? On a side note, how do I flirt as a guy? I am really socially awkward and it feels like I have no ability to flirt. Like I said I just freeze up and don't know what to say or do, and have a tough time getting beyond small talk in almost any conversation with anyone except my close friends."
dating_advice,I'm nervous around men I'm interested in,"Hello men! Can you guys tell when a woman is nervous around you? Competent men make me nervous at times and I really wanna break out of that.

Sometimes ill stumble over a word or lose my train of thought, ugh. I just wanna be more confident around guys that are attractive to me, ya know? I'm really attracted to this guy right now and he's tried to talk to me but most of the time I retreat to this timid shell. I'd appreciate it if any of you could give some advice. Do you like when girls share their life stories with you or is the mystery more interesting? Do you like when girls initiate first? Anything helps! Thanks!"

dating_advice,"Why would my heterosexual male friend say to his trans friend ""we'd all have a happier life"" instead of ""you'd have a happier life""? What does ""we"" refer to in this context?","His trans friend: Obv not applicable to LGBT situations irl but smth I've been considering, discourse wise, is the flaws in the gender-based attraction model.

His trans friend: If we're establishing that presentation =/= gender, then we've created a contradiction in our own language we use to describe orientation

His trans friend: I see a lotta posts saying how regardless of stage of transition cis gay men shud still be Attracted to trans men

His trans friend: but its also naive and literally wrong to think attraction is just... ""oh youre a guy? im attracted to you now"" ???

His trans friend: when you see ppl irl yourr attracted to Features

His trans friend: So if gender isnt related to physical features then why are we still defining attraction that way?

dating_advice,I believe I am partially responsible for attracting insecure attachment types. How do I being to attract healthier partners?,"I seem to have an issue with attracting anxious/avoidant types who are one-sided. It's funny because they say when you let go of finding love, it comes to you. So I did that. I told myself, I'm just going to be myself and love who I am and if someone magically connects and we form something, then it'll happen. The day after I did that a guy approached me and asked for my number. It turns out that he was seemingly interested however exhibited some red flags early on such as after only texting for a few day,s wanting to meet immediately that weekend and when it came to sharing information about each other he would always refer to his life and barely acknowledge mine.  I always try to show interest and follow up with genuine questions about  what he shares however he only had one word responses for mine . 

In my own personal friendships I used to have superficial basic relationships where we lightly knew each other, but it's because I  didn't let people in and had issues trusting people. I felt that people wouldn't want to hear about my life or what I had to say wasn't good enough. So I  took a test and discovered that I'm more of an anxious attachment type with a slight avoidant side because even though my mom was emotionally and physically supportive in my childhood, she was emotionally dismissive sometimes therefore forming my preoccupied personality.

 I  sometimes care a lot about how a person perceives me, how the relationship is going, what they're doing and the avoidant side is when they want to know something too deep, I usually quiet down. However, that's slowly changing  I'm becoming more secure in myself and displaying confidence and sharing with people regardless if they think im good enough or not. 

Anyway, how this relates to relationships is why is it so hard for me to find a guy  who is reciprocal and interested just as much as I am in him. I do equally show the amount effort while dating, but I still find men who want to take me out on dates but mainly are one-sided when it comes to talking about ourselves and establishing a connection. Could that partially be my fault? I do have some issues opening up at times, but I am increasingly getting more emotionally vulnerable and confident but still some guys only want to talk about their lives. How can I find a healthy, secure guy who cares about me just as much as I do about him?

And for those of you who would say are a more secure attachment type and have dated secure men, do you tend to attract all the different attachment types or only secure?"
dating_advice,I don't like to pursue girls because I feel like there is too much competition. Am I alone on this?,"So I (M20) have been having a bit of a tough time with dating (obviously from the title). I wanted to give you all my thoughts about this pursuing girls. I feel like girls are being thirsted on by many guys. Some of these guys are going to be better looking then me and more popular. But I feel like if I pursue a girl, then I'm automatically in competition just like every other guy in her DMs and messages. This makes me feel like I'm playing a losing game, because I never know if she's leading me on while talking seriously to another guy. This makes me feel kind of bad because a girl should like me for who I am if we click and are attracted to each other. But I feel like I have to compete against the other guys in her DMs who might be BETTER than me.


A friend of mine posted on his snap story that said ""you may be in her DMs, but I'm in her guts"". I know that sounded douchey as all hell but it made me wonder what if that's how girls are? 

Are there any other ways to pursue a girl other than to be like the REST of the guys who are failing to get with her?

*I'm not trying to offend anyone with this post. Please, just cut me some slack. I'm only 20 years old and I am not experienced in the dating world due to the overwhelming changes in the dating world like social media and dating apps. If you don't believe me, there are PLENTY of posts on reddit that prove my point that dating is tough these days.*"
dating_advice,Good no move?,So I (31M) was at a bar tonignt (BWW).  This very attractive woman sits down with one chair between us. My buddy tells me to go talk top her but I noticed than she never even glanced my way.  I made no move because basically I don't even feel like she knew I  was there.  It is kind of eating at me a little.  It was a good no move right?
dating_advice,How can I persuade her to go on the date with me?,"So long story short, I met a girl in class (college) seven days ago. We've been texting each other every single day, and talking (with a lot of light flirting) in class maybe three times between last Wednesday and this Wednesday. We make sure we show up to our class at the same time (individually paced class) and I walk her to her car when she leaves. We're at the hugging stage, and our hugs are going from simple friendly hugs to more affectionate hugs. I asked her if she would consider dating me and she did say yes, but she wants to take the relationship thing a bit slow for now due to a bad past relationship experience. We couldn't go out last weekend because she had to work all weekend, quite literally. We've been on a lunch date during the school day, but during the weekends she legitimately does work all day AND night throughout the entire weekend. She is in a bit of a financial struggle. Our plans last weekend didn't happen because she had to work, and she was extremely apologetic of it when we met in class on the following Monday. This weekend she has to work pretty much the same, but she gets off of work at 7 PM on Saturday. She says if she's not too tired she would love to go out with me and do something, but she said she is usually very tired after she gets off.

Is there something that I can say or do to try to persuade her to go out with me after she gets off of work on Saturday whether she's tired or not?"

dating_advice,Should I give up on dating/trying to find a girlfriend?,"I'm 29 and all my life throughout school, college, and even work life I never had a single girl interested in me in person. Not once. 

Now approaching my 30s, my looks are definitely going away, hairline is starting to mature/recede, and gray. Wrinkles setting in. It's only downhill from here.

Should I just give that fantasy up?"
dating_advice,"Never really attempted to date before, advice on where to start? (23M, gay, details in post)","To preface this question, just putting some details below:

Spent all of high school closeted/not really accepting the fact that I was gay, but once I went to college I gradually became more comfortable with it. However it took me until almost the end of senior year to ""fully"" come out (as in to like all my old friends from home and a few family members). Through the duration of college, since I was still slowly learning to accept myself I never felt ""ready"" or interested at even the thought of dating. There were a few instances where guys would show interest in me (especially a notable incident where my one gay friend from back home took me on a ""surprise"" date) but I would always get really nervous and back away from their approach. On top of that, (since high school) I was dealing with a (relatively speaking) moderate case of cystic acne which made me feel really insecure and baffled the few moments where someone was attracted to me. 

Nonetheless, it's been almost two years since the end of college and I feel more confident in myself than I did back then. I was on Accutane towards the end of college which thankfully stopped the acne issue, and regarding my sexuality, I have no issues with it and am actually pretty open about it. Now that I have more time on my hands (working is so less time intensive than college was, thank gosh) I've recently grown more interested in the thought of being in a relationship, however I'm unsure how to really go about this whole dating thing.

I downloaded a few dating apps over the past months, but admittedly I haven't used them as much as I probably should... In the beginning I actually felt anxiety on them because I'm still kind of insecure about how I look (have some acne scars left post-Accutane, aren't really that prominent in my photos so I always worry that people will be bothered by them if I happen to meet them IRL). I use just one (Hinge) a bit more now but it feels so hard to keep a conversation going. I'm pretty friendly and I try my best to give thorough responses but usually people give very succinct ones back and it feels like I'm always the only one putting in effort to carry the conversation... I think it might be because I kind of start off the conversation with 'light' things (like TV shows, what we do for work, blah blah) hoping the other person will bring up the more 'dating' aspect of the convo since I'm not good at flirting and whatnot.

I should've mentioned above that I actually have gone on one date sort of recently - Basically someone who found me on OkCupid when I was using it a few months ago, added me on another social media, and we started talking via there. At the end of the week of talking, we had a date in person that surprisingly went well (I can be shy at times but the conversation went smoothly). Unfortunately things didn't really continue afterwards because right after I left, he started blowing up my phone and getting upset with me for not responding when he wanted me to (which freaked me out, among other red flags throughout that week that I turned a blind eye on until that moment which I won't get further into for now...). So since that brief situation's done, kinda back to square one.

Sorry for the ramble! This felt a bit cathartic, hopefully someone manages to read through my lengthy essay to provide feedback or if you're in a similar situation I'd be interested in hearing how you went about it. TLDR: 23 year old gay male, not much experience in dating due to self-confidence issues that I've sort of overcome, more interested now but not really sure how to drive conversations in dating apps in an ""efficient"" way."

dating_advice,The Guy That Wants To Marry Me vs The Guy That Doesn‚Äôt Know My Name,"Hi all I also posted this in r/askmen then realized this would be a good thread to get advice from too! Back in October I matched with a kid on tinder who I thought was cute, but didn‚Äôt think of it as anything but just another tinder match. I‚Äôm a freshman in college btw. One of my girls in my sorority saw me in his matches and the three of us knew each other and didn‚Äôt even know. This guy and I never even snap chatted during this time, but my friend wanted me to hook up with him and get with him but I just didn‚Äôt want to. Seeing him in person made me realize that I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him and the physical MATTERS. We went out for Halloweekend and dancing around him just felt awkward. Fast forward to end of November I needed a date to my sorority cocktail and he ends up taking me, but again the dancing around him felt awkward. He‚Äôs a sweet guy don‚Äôt get me wrong. Now that we are back in school he‚Äôs just told me that he had a girlfriend the entire time but they were in an open relationship, but she dumped him and he is now heartbroken. 

On the other hand, my main friend group and I were having a girls night last week just talking about guys and one guy came up in the conversation who is a sophomore on campus and he is just a different breed, like no other guy I‚Äôve seen before. I really want to pursue this guy and  get to know him. Anyways, I expressed this to the kid who took me to my formal just to get his point of view as a guy because I do consider him a friend. He literally goes ‚ÄúDate him so that he breaks your heart and we can get married.‚Äù Like what? We just get back on campus and this kid is telling me how he wants to marry me and it just makes me slightly uncomfortable and questioning. I‚Äôve known him since October and he knows nothing about me and won‚Äôt stop talking about how he wants to marry me. He also made me help him choose new pictures to add on his tinder bio and tells me about his most recent hookups.

I feel that he is still heartbroken from his ex which he admits and wants to use me as void. I want to pursue this other guy who is in my class because I don‚Äôt want to look back on this time and wish I didn‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt know how to and feel conflicted and somewhat guilty."
dating_advice,How to know when to stop trying/give up?,"I‚Äôm going to leave this fairly vague because I don‚Äôt want it coming back to me, etc, etc. but I (18 F) have been close with a guy (19 M) for almost two years now. We met through mutual friends, but he lives very very far away and rarely get to see each other (like once a year). I told him how I felt very early on, but he told me that he did not see me in that way. Ok, life sucks, I kept the relationship going because he is one of my best friends. My only issue is that I don‚Äôt believe him. He is very logical and bad at expressing his emotions. When he does express his emotions, it is very closed off and confusing. I have to ask him questions and dig before he‚Äôll tell me how he really feels. He had a bad experience with a girl many years ago, and stopped dating. I‚Äôve heard it ruined the concept for him. I enjoy writing very much, and so he has written me a few letters. We FaceTime whenever we get the chance, and the last time I saw him I gave him a piece of jewelry matching mine that we both constantly wear. He never talks to me about any girls, and always wants to see how I‚Äôm doing/what I‚Äôm doing/interested in my life. These may not sound significant, but knowing him makes these things a very big deal, as he doesn‚Äôt ever do stuff like this. Our mutual friends have all commented that he treats me differently than everyone else, and I see the way he looks at me. I know we may not be able to date right now due to the distance, but I don‚Äôt know if I should stop trying or keep fighting. I genuinely feel like this is the person I am meant to be with. At what point do I take his word and just move on?"

A few weeks ago we broke up.. he said that he had too much going on and that he didn‚Äôt have the emotional capacity to care for someone else.. but we‚Äôve still kept in contact.. he said he isn‚Äôt looking for anyone and needs to be alone.. yet he‚Äôs following all of these girls on social media and followed his ex almost immediately after.. he texts me but takes hours to reply.. we met up to talk as we hadn‚Äôt seen him eachother in awhile and I thought this would provide some clarity. The conversation went in circles and he kept saying he loves and cares about me but wouldn‚Äôt give me the answers I wanted.. I left feeling more confused then ever and we haven‚Äôt talked since.. I feel the urge to text him constantly but it seems like he doesn‚Äôt care enough to reply.. and when he does it‚Äôs hours late and he says he was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù do I move on or do I give him space and try to work this out?

Also, these people are the type who have no problem talking and going out with girls or boys, I'm a fucking introvert compared to them (and I dated and stayed at parties, but damn, it's not even close to what they did already did).

dating_advice,Feeling dumb and rejected,"For the past few months I (F34) have been casually chatting with a guy (32M) at my gym. Both of us are married.
I have never openly flirted with him, although did complement him about his gym skills a few times. He doesn‚Äôt flirt with me either, but I did catch him a few times ogling me. 
Today I asked him if he‚Äôd be up for grabbing a coffee. He said Maybe. I asked why ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù? He said it depended on what‚Äôs behind my request and said he is a married guy. My response was So am I! 
Anyway, I txted him saying that there was nothing behind my request. I said I like chatting with him and don‚Äôt think there was anything inappropriate in grabbing a coffee since we both are married. Then I added that it didn‚Äôt seem like he was into the idea and said not to worry about it. He didn‚Äôt reply. 

I feel dumb, embarrassed, and rejected. Did I act inappropriately? He was always nice and chatty, why such cold reaction? 

We always workout at the same time. How do I act around him now?"

dating_advice,Confusion? Baggage from past relationships?,"My mind has been racing the past couple of days. I‚Äôm not sure if past relationships have negatively effected me. I feel happier when I‚Äôm single. When I‚Äôm not talking or dating a guy, there isn‚Äôt a weight on my my shoulder. I‚Äôm not constantly worrying about what the guy is doing or who he‚Äôs with. There‚Äôs no need to update anyone (aside from my mom) about where I am or what I‚Äôm up to. 

My heart is confused right now. From mid-November to mid-January, I was talking to a guy who wanted a relationship. He never told me that he was seeing other people until I asked him. From that moment forward, I always wondered what he was doing when I didn‚Äôt hear from him in a day or two. He told me he that he had feelings for me and wanted to see where things go. But he told went on dates with other people. I started to question his word to me. To be frank, we weren‚Äôt official so I guess it was okay for him to see other people. We never ‚Äúdefined the relationship‚Äù. That ‚Äútalklationship‚Äù soon fizzled out. 

Afterwards, I met another guy from Bumble and we immediately hit it off. So well that I got scared and let my guard up. This guy told me that he‚Äôs interested in a relationship and could see us turning into one. Maybe me putting my guard up scared him? Maybe he‚Äôs just not a good texter? He told me that he‚Äôs been hurt before. A lot. Maybe he‚Äôs scared too. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should continue to pursue this guy. He seems like such a good guy and I don‚Äôt want let him go. But how can I love someone when I don‚Äôt love myself? I have flaws and insecurities, some of which I‚Äôm working on. The second guy knows that I‚Äôve been hurt and that I‚Äôm scared of love. He doesn‚Äôt want to move fast and I don‚Äôt think we should. 

Thank you if you‚Äôve made it this far. Thank you for any advice that you have to offer."

The only thing is, I think this guy is definitely crushing on me (I hope he just wants to be my friend) and he doesn‚Äôt know I have a boyfriend because that just hasn‚Äôt come up naturally in our conversations (mind you ive only known this guy for 3 weeks since classes at my university have started). 

I am worried while we are having coffee hes going to say something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù or something like that and actively start flirting. Or maybe he‚Äôll ask me if I have a boyfriend. Like, what do I even say to that? 

Should I tell him before we go to coffee that I have a boyfriend? I just feel like telling him that would be awkward because what if he just wants to be my friend? Then I would look like a self absorbed jerk.

dating_advice,Is it weird to reach out to ex-boyfriend's friend?,"I have a random question- I was in a long term relationship with my ex who has an abusive alcoholic for 4 years. After I left him, he has continued to contact me this last year and beg for me back but I haven't gone back, even though it's been hard. We recently went no contact- a year later, and I haven't talked to him in two weeks.

While we lived together, he was unemployed from Oct. 2017- Jan, 2019 when I left. During that time I had suspicions that he had cheated on me (phone on silent, putting it in a weird place while we slept, always on it, going to bed at a different time than me) and I found mascara in our apartment that wasn't mine. He always denied cheating, but changed his story about the mascara and settled on the story that he must have picked up from outside when he was drunk one night.

For closure's sake, would it be super crazy to contact his friend to see if he had ever cheated on me? I just feel like I want to know for sure. I'm in the process of really trying to move on now, and it's been difficult for me."

We planned to meet the next day, but then we couldn‚Äôt really meet up because of classes. During the first few days we were pretty close, mostly talking and bonding.

We planned to meet up on Tuesday but somehow she wasn‚Äôt able to get back to me until way later than the time  I first planned to meet up.

dating_advice,Should I add someone I met for a date on snapchat?,"
So, there‚Äôs a guy I went on a date with. We worked together, different departments but worked together nonetheless. I don‚Äôt ever hookup with anyone, but it was quite obvious the intent was to hookup eventually as he was moving out of state soon for a promotion. Well, the date went well (at least I think), we had dinner, obviously there were a couple lulls in conversation, it happens. He said once or twice ‚ÄúYou can tell me to just shut up, haha‚Äù because I was just nervous and it maybe looked like I wasn‚Äôt enjoying myself. But we overall laughed a bit and talked for like 2 hours after we had dinner. Good sign, I think? Anyway, his moving date seemed to come up quickly and he left like a week after that. He texted me right after the date to make sure I got home safe which I thought was sweet, but we didn‚Äôt talk at all after that. I saw him at work after that a few times and we barely spoke a word to each other, not that we did before (he asked me out via dating app). I found out he was trying to hookup with the girl in my department, but was super upfront about it. I thought it was strange he took me on a nice date and then left, but told this girl he wanted to hookup before he left over text. Anyway, I saw him in my quick add and thought hey, he might be back in town at some point and I want to make it known that I‚Äôm interested in possibly something physical. Is that weird? I tend to let things happen rather than make things happen, and I don‚Äôt know if I should take the initiative here.

dating_advice,What to do after a first date?,"Hey!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 30-something girl, and I went out a couple days ago with a guy from Tinder. I went straight to his house, we made dinner (or he did and I helped a tiny bit), we had wine, talked A LOT and had sex. I spent the night, had breakfast with him (which he also made) and left.

I texted him the same day in the afternoon, saying that I loved spending time with him, and that I had forgotten something at his house (which was a true accident). He said well, you'll have to come back and get it, and a winky face. That was yesterday.

I really want a second date with him, but I don't where to go from know. 

I know that's really silly, but I'd love some advice on waiting for him to say hi/ask me out or texting him (and what to say)."
dating_advice,I [18M] didn‚Äôt get any contact info. Feeling regretful.,"So I attend college and in between classes I have a huge gap. I decided during that gap that I wanted to buy some AirPods at the nearest Apple store. 

A girl my age helps me out with the transaction, all while we have some very light and mildly flirty conversation. I was planning on trying to get some form of communication as the transaction finished, but she gave me what I came for and said enjoy.

I left and grabbed a bite and while eating I thought about going back to try and grab a number. Since I didn‚Äôt purchase AppleCare for the headphones, my plan was to try and return to the store to add the AppleCare to the headphones with her again, and this time I‚Äôd (hopefully) be successful.

As I walked back to the store, I noticed she was speaking with her manager at a table near the cafe. I assumed it was something about her job, so I waited and waited close to the entrance of the store, since I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt something that was potentially important for her. The convo between her boss and her lasted a while, but never saw an end. I had to get back home, so I decided to leave it at that.

I‚Äôm pretty much regretting it now that I‚Äôm thinking back on it, why I never got her number. It was a tough situation to be in and it‚Äôs just very difficult in general. Any tips on what to do in a tricky situation like this? I thought about going back to the store same time next week to try. But I wanted to see how to deal with this regret now."

dating_advice,Weird situation with girl,"Almost an aita post but not really. I am (17m) this girl (17f) hated each other for quite a bit (she mostly didnt like me and i just didnt care), then all of a sudden, around last november, she started talking to me. I had had pretty rough night, and we were standing in a circle listening to a guy tell stories and she just came up behind me and wrapped her arms around me the rest of the time. strange change of pace but whatever, i didnt think too much of it, maybe she felt bad for me cause i had a bad night yk.

Well, she started texting me all the time and i started to figure she likes me. Ok, so she asks me to lunch, i happily say sure (at about 9 am or so) and then lunch rolls around and she says she can‚Äôt all of a sudden because she has to run errands for her mom (keep in mind we are still only in high school), but then texts me saying she‚Äôs debating going and seeing friend (m) at work, which, maybe im wrong but completely invalidates her excuse from before, but i just dont see why she would lie to get out of something she brought up??

After that, essentially i stopped talking to her and stopped caring after a while because she seemed to be super interested in me over text, but whenever i saw her in person always seemed like she didnt feel like talking to me. Whatever, cut my losses and move on.

Fast forward to january, texts me and says she misses me, i respond and ask her about how her break went, tells me a bunch of shit along with the fact the she got rejected by her crush, i basically left it there, she texts me again with something to the effect of ‚Äúi love you‚Äù i may have said something snarky but still brushed it off since i had basically stopped caring. Texts me yet again, i give her the benefit of her the doubt and go along with it.

She basically said some shit like ‚Äúi realized i liked that one night (at beginning of story)‚Äù, i go along with it (kinda feel like this is bullshit because of crush she had i mentioned earlier), but i play along here. I know we have a common interest in ice skating, so i suggest we go do that. ‚ÄúOh for sure, my mom has her birthday this weekend, so i cant on saturday, but maybe sunday or next weekend‚Äù, can‚Äôt sunday cause her family is still in town. text her a bit between now and then, follow up today with ‚Äúhows this weekend looking for you, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt friday cause im hanging out with friend (f), can‚Äôt saturday cause im going prom dress shopping, and my parents don‚Äôt let me hang out with people on sundays‚Äù. Fair enough, but based off of what she had said before with ‚Äúmaybe sunday‚Äù and multiple social media posts of her hanging out with people on sundays, i think thats bs.

Anyway, kinda call her out on her possible bs, says something to the effect of ‚Äúthats why i said maybe‚Äù and then says ‚Äúmaybe we just won‚Äôt hang out if your gonna be like that‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really give a fuck at this point, i just want a straight answer one way or another. i dont feel like iata here, but im not really sure. Anybody who bothered to read all that, i‚Äôd really like to hear your opinions on the situation."

dating_advice,How to Undo Colorist Tendencies and How to Better Act on Desire," I am realizing I have a problem where I never pursue the people I am most attracted to, but the ones I am most attracted to out of those who have expressed interest. This seems logical but I am also feeling that the most successful relationships for me have been ones where I am enamored with everything about a man. This isn't to say I'm superficial because I have been in many long term relationships with people based largely on their personality with attraction at a close second or third priority, but I feel like that attraction is what makes me most organically affectionate and loving the way most people want to receive it. Without that passion, it feels like dating on paper alone.

It's frustrating to bring up because I know how steeped in antiblackness dating preferences are. However, I have only ever had that tingle that encompasses my whole body when looking at brown and lighter skinned men. Darker skinned men absolutely turn me on, but it's not as much of an initial visceral response. I have been in long term relationships with darker skinned men who I find undeniably attractive and have had no problems expressing that. However, it's never been the same as what I feel seeing a Latinx, Arab, South Asian or brown to light skinned Black man with a square jawline. I have tried to actively unlearn these things, to retrain myself to react the same way when I see white or darker skinned men. It's this ""middle"" that excites me most, and I think it relates to the image of a partner I had growing up as a young gay boy generally being Carlos Solis from Desperate Housewives, but also from the fact that I am light skinned and there are many studies that suggest humans are attracted to people we look like. 

I generally don't date the people who I feel passionately about because of those ""date someone who's more into you than you are them"" sayings, as well as the ""Black men only like light skins/Black men don't date Black men,"" which I know are flawed logics but that fear of judgement guides me. I've only dated Black and Latinx men, from dark skinned to pale light skin. I'm only speaking to my sense of all encompassing desire. I know some people think attraction shouldn't be high on the priority list, but I've found that I am someone who expresses affection best when I want to brag about how sexy I think my partner is. Not just when I think they're beautiful in their way or super cute.

Does anyone have any advice for this beyond unlearning what is attractive? Or maybe specific unlearning approaches you've enlisted that worked? I would like to have my passion follow me wherever I find love, but I have relegated passion to the side because I think my passions could be considered colorist. I also can't just say ""fuck what everybody thinks"" because I believe in community and want to be held accountable for my ignorance. 

Also, how does one act on their desires for someone they think is 100/10? Besides befriending them and seeing where things go, that is. 

Thanks for any suggestions!"

I do like him and would wanna keep things casual as well. So, if someone can advice how the whole casual dating works? It will really help me. Thanks."
dating_advice,"Asked the guy I am seeing what he wants, his answer does not reflect his actions. Do I just end it?","For a brief background:

I (24F) have been hanging out/hooking up this guy {24M) for almost 2 months. Texting every day. He‚Äôs taken me out a couple times. Hooking up pretty much every weekend. We‚Äôre keeping it nonexclusive because he is moving across the world in a few months, so thought we might as well enjoy the time we have together.

Lately, it seems like he was losing interest. We hung out last Friday, but then he ignored me Saturday night when I asked him to hang and then again on Sunday was being super vague when I asked him again if he wanted to hang out. Texts have been less and less and more brief.

I figure: I gotta just straight up ask him what he wants.

So, I asked him, I said ""hey do you want to keep hanging out or not? I rather know now than let it fizzle/slowly fade out. No hard feelings, please be honest.""

He responds, ‚Äúyes for sure! I‚Äôve been having a blast with you and would also like to stay in contact when I leave.‚Äù

Not the answer I was expecting, I thought he was gonna end it. Yet ever since then he *still* hasn‚Äôt texted me much or asked to hang out or make plans which he did a lot before.

like..

Does he just want me to stay wrapped around his finger?

Does he want me to just be available to hook up when he wants to?

If anyone can give me some sort of outside perspective on this, it‚Äôd be helpful. Dude is driving me crazy."

dating_advice,Your input on dating single dads?,"i am in my late 20s and he is 43.  i have no kids and plan to have 1-2 kids in the future.  the guy i was seeing had 3.  ages 4 and 5.. 2 of which are twins.   not to mention he is financially taking care of his ex baby mama (they werent married) and has the kids 50/50 of the week.  i started to feel like i deserve way more than what this guy could offer because its not like he has much to offer to me. 

I am honestly starting to feel like I am worth so much more than dating a single dad and should make it a rule to not date single dads anymore unless I'm benefiting so much out of it that a dad is worth it. 

has any of u been in the same situation?  what were the pros/cons?  i want to hear from those who can relate. 

of course i take partial responsibility in my own decisions, but I felt like I learned this the hard way."

dating_advice,Should I ask him out or not because he hasn't asked me?,"Hi all

Ok quick backstory - I met this guy when we rented a boat at Disney. I thought he was cute and managed to find his instagram to see if he had a girlfriend, it didnt appear he did. So I messaged him a week later after trying to decide if I should or not and was just like hey hope this isnt weird I just so happened to find your instagram as I had mentioned in a story I had a guy called (fake name) John as my boat captain and someone who follows me knew who you were. He replied saying he remembered us and that he had actually asked his coordinator how old she thought I was because he found me attractive. He actually mentioned a couple times he found me very attractive. For context, I do social media and youtube full time, I have a lot of instagram followers so in his reply he mentioned not knowing I did that job. I'm 26, he's 23. I graduated uni a couple years back and have a good full time job doing this, whereas he is still in uni about to graduate, my mum mentioned maybe he's intimidated but I dont know if I believe that.

He wasnt the quickest replier in the world but we talked a little and I was hoping he'd ask me out especially since attraction was mutual - but 6 days later and he hasnt. Maybe 3 days ago his replies started taking longer, took him a full day to reply to one of my messages despite being online. I replied to him yesteday with a message that he could easily have just not responded to as there wasn't much to say back. But instead he sent me a message about something irrelevent telling me what he did that day which he didn't have to. So it's like he wants to talk to me but not enough to reply quickly? Last night he replied to me quicker again and first thing this morning, but nothing all day now. And he hasn't asked me out. I was also pretty honest with him a couple days ago and said I actually sought him out because I liked him and found him attractive, he said he thought it was funny I did that and smart to have found him and that we all stalk people but nothing from that. i thought maybe he'd see I liked him and ask me out but didnt. 

I also put out an olive branch to him and said I wanted to go to Epcot but needed someone to go with...nothing. So I'm thinking that he just isn't really interested. Half of my friends say to move on the other half say to ask him out myself in case he doesnt want to seem too forward. But the lack of messages and fact we havent had a proper conversation yet because he's not responding to me much doesn't help. Maybe I could slyly somehow give him my phone number? We still talk on instagram messages.

Am I wasting my time? What do you think? I'm wondering if maybe he's watched some of my youtube videos and it put him off? I dont know, it's my job lol thanks"
dating_advice,Girl is being very confusing,"Long story short, this girl and I had been dating previously but she ended it due to her not being able to commit herself to a relationship. He wanted to stay close however and maybe a friendship. We talked for a few weeks and it kinda fizzled off naturally. Fast forward a month or two later. She sent a few long texts saying how she was thankful for me being there for her and a bunch of other stuff. We‚Äôre both in college and spring semester is upon us. So I suggested we should grab a bite and catch up to which she happily agreed to. I also suggested we start up a streak to keep in touch. After about a week she ended the streak and just recently she unfollowed me from Instagram. Idk what to make of this since just a week ago she reached out to me and we both agreed we wanted to get together and catch up and everything. Just makes no sense"
dating_advice,I want to break up with my girlfriend of 2 months but i know I will feel sad at some point because I invested myself into relationship,"After 2 months of relationship things got a lot clearer for me, we had few arguments between each other, nothing major but enough to give me space to think about everything.
I realized I was trying to show her affection and invest into relationship, but she is passive-aggressive type and refuse to talk about anything regarding us, she just want to let it fly even if we argue every other day.

There is a lot more stuff about her that show me major red flags and give me enough reason to brake up with her. I want to do it in manner that I won‚Äôt feel like I owe something to myself or her, like I was a bad person, because I still left piece of my love in that relationship. But most importantly I don‚Äôt feel like I love her in any way and she doesn‚Äôt show it either.

Shoot me with suggestions and make it pain free."
dating_advice,Leaving is getting harder,"Me again, I posted earlier about how to break up. I know I‚Äôm determined to, but I‚Äôm battling myself to keep the courage to do it. I‚Äôm already crying trying to figure out how to start the conversation.  I love this man so much, but the facts are facts and they are stacked against him. I‚Äôm prepared for the after math abd ready for a new beginning, but I‚Äôm not ready and I don‚Äôt think I will be."
dating_advice,"Things are going great in person, but he's not texting much?","I (27F) have been seeing a guy (29M) for a couple weeks, we met on Bumble. We both established that we are looking for a relationship as an end goal.

We've been going out on dates (or hangouts) consistently and things are fantastic when we are in person. He shows a LOT of interest and always makes future plans with me. We have a great time together. I even met a couple of his close friends.

My problem is, he doesn't text me as much as when we first started talking.. and with way less flirtation too (in the texts). Idk why I read into texting so much but I do and don't want to! It makes me wonder if he doesn't like me.

Do you think this is any reason for me to worry/doubt his interest or intentions with me? He will always reply to me if I have something to say but just doesn't seem huge on texting. We touch base at least once a day.

Also - I want to read from his cues and not worry about texting HIM too much - but I always worry that if I don't text a guy, he will think I'm not interested lol (I don't mean not replying - I mean not starting a conversation or whatever if he didn't reply back to something) 

Is it okay for me to not text him (eg. double text) to allow him to reach out a bit?"

dating_advice,"Can someone help me prove my buddy wrong, or correct me if I‚Äôm wrong?","So one of my homies and I got into a pretty long debate about something so simple, women on social media. My buddy made a comment saying that women typically share and ‚Äúlike‚Äù what actually applies to them in real life on social media. So for example if a woman liked a post about a girl saying she went out with 4 different men just for the free food, then the girl who liked it probably does the same thing.

At times when I ask him how he feels about me he will change the subject, or say things like ""I don't do words of affirmation"" or ""I don't want to make your head too big.""

dating_advice,"Going on a date whit my crush, help!","So me and my crush are going on a date tomorrow! (ik omg.) it's not our official first date tough cus we was kinda on a first date whitout calling it a date. But now it's officially a date!

OK so this is what I need help whit:

1. How do I make myself more interesting?
We have a lot in common and he is a talker, and I'm more of a listener, which makes the whole conversation rely on him pretty much, how do I make myself more interesting to talk to?

2. Wtf do I wear?!
We are going right after school so no time for big changes cus we are going on a bus. It's also really cold outside and we are planning to fool around outside before we go to the cinemas. So I need something to keep me warm and not sweat and drown everyone watching the movie. Wtf to wear? I'm thinking of a pair of jeans and a black skintight sweater, too plain or in perfect range. We are not together tho. We are seeing if we match emotionally first, so the mentallaty is kinda friends.. Maybe?

3. What scent does guys like in perfume!?"
dating_advice,"You look into their eyes and you see their whole entire mind, soul, and yours reflected right back to you...... or you look into someone eases eyes and see safety, a comrade, whats better?","I'm not sure if everyone has experienced this in their life, but do you know when you first meet someone and by the end of the night/day/date whichever, you just kinda know that you are totally 100% into them? No doubts, just in your gut you felt that serious in-explainable, undeniable, crazy connection / chemistry, and every time you hang out with that person again and again the bond is unreal and grows for both of you? They are immediately  your best friend and understand everything about you without out you saying a word. I know a lot of people will say this is just lust but deep in my soul i ended up loving this person more than i had loved either of my other, prior very long-term partners in life. It wasn't just an attraction.

Now lets say that doesn't work out w that person. You try your best to move on, years go by and finally the pain subsides but you still cannot forget that connection and how it made BOTH of you feel. You move on and try and date but no one compares. Do you think it is possible to find that connection again? Also, what if you meet someone who meets all of the qualities you want in a person? Smart, open minded, fun, likes a lot of the same things you do, you even find them to be really attractive and good looking,  BUT that intense chemistry / connection seems to not be there.  Does this mean they are just not for you ? It feels like something is missing and you think that it is that high / chemistry.. does this mean that you shouldn't force it and cut it off, so that you can live your life happily alone until that person that gives you that un-doubting feeling?  Or is it ok to take something slow, lead someone on, just because you enjoy their company and their attention in hopes that you will eventually fall in love with them? Feeling conflicted, anyone have any advice? Anyone know what i mean? 

summary: can you fall for someone without real connection / chemistry?"
dating_advice,Ghosting: When is it appropriate?,"Before the new year I was dating this girl I was absolutely crazy about, she's awesome. We had only been dating for like 3 months and we had only been exclusive for a month or so of that time, so the relationship was super new. Anyway, one day she stopped texting me and eventually got back to me to explain a super serious and surprising death in her family. She subsequently never answered me again and went on to block me at some point over the holidays. We still have not spoken and I am still blocked; it's been about a month and a half now.

So, I thought this was inappropriate ghosting. Over the past few years of dating, I have ghosted dozens of girls and one or two were probably a little morally ambiguous at best and I've been ghosted as well. However, I never ghosted anyone that I had even a slightly defined relationship with. Also, if the girls ever texted me more than a few times into me ghosting them I would simply text back and tell them that I didn't think we were right for each other but that they are great people who will meet someone for sure.

Just wondering where other people are on this issue. Obviously, we can't be expected to afford every person we go on a date with a personal breakup. But how deep do we have to be until that is necessary?"

dating_advice,Is asking to hang once a week too much for someone you met from tinder,"So I (21M) feel like a lot of the girls I talk to from tinder eventually loose interest, and I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs because I seem needy or too available. Usually what I do is I‚Äôll hit them up with a question like ‚ÄúWho was your first celebrity crush‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat is the riskiest thing you‚Äôve ever done‚Äù to get the conversation rolling then I ask them out. Then I usually do something like that the next week. 

It‚Äôs not that I have a lot of free time but I usually have like a day or two per week where I can afford to spend time with someone and I obviously would rather hang with a girl then be by myself. So is once every other week usually better when you first start seeing a girl or is it something else I‚Äôm doing?"

dating_advice,Jealousy pushing me away.,I love my boyfriend. We have been together for a couple years now and things were great at first. It was effortless and I really thought he was the one until recently things started changing. I got a new job as a cop and its been tough on him because as a woman in this field Im surrounded by men. Hes been very jealous lately and it is pushing me away and Im starting to look at other guys because I feel so suffocated. I don't know what to do. I have talked to him and told him his jealous is too much for me and he acknowledges that he needs to stop being so jealous but I haven't seen any changes. I love him but I can't spend the rest of my life constantly explaining myself and having to reassure him that I would never cheat on him. Any advice?
dating_advice,"If someone likes dating you but wants to be friends, what is the best way to take this relationship/friendship?","I think a women‚Äôs point of view would be better in helping me understand things which otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be possible. 

I‚Äôm finding it hard to understand girls and what they need or really mean when they say something. For instance, if you‚Äôve seen the first few episodes of ‚ÄúThe good doctor‚Äùseason 2, this girl likes the guy, they date and spend time with each other and even move in together but the girl constantly insists that they stay friends and avoid any feelings for each other. Please note: if you haven‚Äôt watched those episodes, the guy is autistic. So in one way it makes sense for that girl to behave this way but in real life, with normal people this has happened for me and also for other people I know. In my life, I‚Äôve had a girl say she has a crush on me, I liked her so then we dated for a year, talk over phone all night and mostly fall asleep without hanging up. She always says she feels better after talking to me.. even when she cries or couldn‚Äôt sleep she‚Äôd call me.. over the year I liked her enough to ask her out on valentines but she got really angry and says she wants me to be friends. Every time we go on dates or even to the movie, I feel loved and fulfilled with her and she‚Äôs admitted she feels the same way but as friends. How do we deal with such things in our lives? Is it a common thing? What could it possibly mean? And how to avoid any complications?"
dating_advice,I [M 28] am confused by girl [F 32],"Ok, so this is the most generic title.

In December I've met her two times. First time we met for coffee and second time we went to the movies. I had the feeling we pretty much hit it off.

So I asked her to if we wanna see eachother before Christmas. Initially she agreed but declined in the morning of the day because she had to work.

Ok whatever. No big deal I thought. In this month I asked her again with the same result. She was making excuses why she couldn't meet up.

So at this point I'm thrown off by her behaviour so I straight up asked her: ""Hey, if you don't want to see me again. Thats ok, but just let me know, so I won't bother you anymore.""

Her answer was that she's sorry and that she is really involved with her work and she does want to see me again. Then again she slips that she's talking about me with her mother and so on. She gives me the vibe that she does want to see me again.

My gut tho tells me that she's not really that interested. Should I listen to my gut and just leave her be? Should I wait for her to make further moves? I'm really clueless. I think actions are more important than words and if she really wanted to she would find time for me.  Or am I too demanding??"
dating_advice,"guys need to cut the BS. if you're old enough to drink, you're old enough to get married.","guys in the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù culture think they just want to stick their meat in holes. enough! sex is all the same feeling.  you should pick a girl and get married already. the whole point of dating is to find someone, get married, and have kids. kids are you only route to immortality.

i was corrupted by the whole ""pickup culture"" so trust me i know. i thought mindless fucking was the answer to life. who could blame me, music, movie, tv, and youtube and IG ‚Äúmodels‚Äù make you think random sex is the end all, be all.  It's not. It's pointless and a waste of time. and i managed to break the hearts of some wonderful girls, and it was for nothing, you don't even remember the ones you have sex with anyway. you remember more the ones you almost did.  it's all been bullshit and lies. 

yes, i concede, that if a girl clearly isn't right for you, then fine, be upfront, cut it off, don't waste her time and find someone else. some guys are looking for new women just to keep having sex, but it's for nothing. it's just for genital spasms, but no one else cares, and they care as much as they do to hear you jerked off today. LOL

freakshows:
after going to seddit, i met a lot of guys who have intimacy issues are start going ""bi"" just to get their rocks off. they'll do anything with anyone just to do it, and they are miserable deep down. i'm not saying you'll start sucking dudes off out desperation (LOL), but do you want to lose control to your issues like? including therapy and the whole nine yards? i dont think so. 

i also talked with girls with lesbian friends who eat them out, even though they don't like it.  and i ask would that be ok if a guy did it to you. and they literally said ""i wouldnt put myself in a compromising position like that with a guy.""  and it's like they are getting taken advantage of by these lesbian girls and rationalizing it that they are friends. this kind of stuff is common, and they are like it's not a big deal.  but if a guy did that - he'd be in jail! shit is crazy out there.  It's not easy being a woman, they need a guy they trust to help them feel more secure. it's the balance in nature, and ""culture"" horribly undermines that. 

energy levels and motivation: 
if you are a virgin M25+, you should jerk off and learn to explore your sexuality, and be ok with it. sex is important and rewarding in a relationship with your important lady.

if you are not, M25+ virgin, than you need to STOP jerking off. dudes, are fucking themselves aggressively, vigorously, and NEEDLESSLY. stop being a wierdo about that, and you'll have all this energy, that it would be almost impossible not to approach someone you like and want.  so, stop jerking off and you will motivate yourself to get out of your house. when i hear of having no energy, the first thing we want to look at is if you're yanking yourself too much.  I'd say there's a good chance we're talking about you.

your journey:
I know you have dreams you want to work on and on THAT journey, you'll run into some nice girls. some girls will be more appropriate for you than others, a and that includes: height , interest, and personality. as you talk with her, and you feel you don't know how to capture her interest or deeply connect with her, then i can help you.  and i'll send you information about how attraction and connection works. proper instructions are NOT taught in school, and i had a friend try it and it blew his mind. it took me a long time and note taking to put this stuff together from REAL Life experience. he said ""rocky you have got to let people know about this stuff, it can change their life!"" so im doing just that.

stop wasting time:
i understand we have desires and want to explore those desires, but without marriage, you're just unfairly wasting both of your lives.   so enough with the ""I'm too young to think about marriage""
life will never be perfect for anything, but ask anyone, and they will tell you ""kids change the game and add so much meaning.""  and instead of making her a single mother where she has to say ""im a strong woman"" - (i get it some women have no choice) but that is NOT  a position of strength, and every man agrees with me on that. women respond to good leadership and if you don't betray her, you'll have an incredible companion to help you reach your dreams.

So, when you find a nice girl who can tolerate your bullshit and doesnt mind making you a sandwich, and enjoys the idea of staying home with the kids while you kick ass at work and buy her whatever she wants and needs, put a ring on that chick‚Äôs finger. the culture of no family is in my belief a population control mechanism, and this post won't undo that, but it definitely can MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER. 

if you want to know about how to generate attraction and capture her interest. I invite you to PM you‚Äôre email, and you‚Äôll join my modest inner circle of friends who take advantage of  my Q+A‚Äôs, where you get massive value on generate attraction and how to capture her interest in deep way. they will NOT teach you this in school, so this becomes even more necessary.  Because, on your journey to making your dreams come true, it can be a long, lonely, and frustrating, but you don‚Äôt have to go at it alone.  often times, guys have to delay realizing their dreams and most desired goals precisely because they don‚Äôt have that great chick on their side.  after all, behind every great man, there is a greater woman, am i right or am i right?  think about what i‚Äôm saying and take action now."
dating_advice,She asked me out then said she was talking to someone else. What would you do?,"I (m30) met this amazing girl (f26) at a large gathering of friends, we spent all day together and developed an amazing connection. We texted for a couple days after and she was hinting that I should ask her out, so I did, and she said yes, but... a day later she said she has been talking to an old friend for a few weeks and agreed to go on a date with him in a couple weeks, but it is not serious, and she could not morally talk or date two people at the same time (we are both devout Christians). She cancelled my date and asked if I was willing to give it a try if it didn't work out with the other guy, and of course, I said yes because I think she is amazing and could be the one. We both talked at length how we never experienced a connection like this before, but she already agreed to go on a date with the other guy and had to honor her word and give him a chance in person. Needless to say, I am an emotional wreck right now sitting in limbo and she doesn't want us to talk until after she figures out what to do because it wouldn't be fair to anyone to maintain two relationships.

He complimented my tattoos and my taste in perfumes (what I was buying). He asked how long I‚Äôd be in the city and poured me out sample bottles, telling me to come back and tell him what I thought of the sample perfumes.

Now, on paper, it sounds like he was flirting with me but I still think that maybe it‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs at work and has to be complimentary and nice to get customers back.

I don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable at work if I go back and ask for his number or something. I hope it get easier to navigate this stuff?"

dating_advice,It's so very difficult,"It's been about 5 months that I've gotten out of my 6+ year long relationship, we still talk the same and we still meet up every week on common days off. But the realisation of not being in a relationship always hits me when I see her, it hurts bad, so very bad! I don't know what to do and how to move on. I don't feel like making a move and I know for a fact I have my walls up now.

dating_advice,Serial second-date canceller... How do I stop?,"(F 26) So over the past two years I've gone on a few first dates, but only one second date. I get all excited when I meet someone and get all hyped for the first date. Then there's little or no chemistry and I dreadfully end up sending that ""I'm sorry but it's not going to work"" text within the next day or so. I kept telling myself it's because there just wasn't chemistry, and if I don't want to go, why force it? Well my friend pointed this pattern out to me and that I've been pretty judgemental probably because I overhype the first date and then am disappointed when it's not that ""special.""

So now here I am, a day after a nice first date with a guy. Yes it wasn't perfect and I didn't feel that ""spark"" or chemistry, but I'm forcing myself to see it through on this second date (tomorrow). Can't deny that I feel miserable about it and really really don't want to go, but what else am I to do?

Anyone else out here a serial second-date canceller or failing to find that connection in online dating?

much appreciated"
dating_advice,Looking for some advice about my relationship,"I feel like if I vent to him a lot and tell him about everything that is going on and whats making me stressed, he'll listen but then he will feel that I am not giving back to him. I also said no to him to hanging out with him because I was busy and he said it is fine but he afterwards told me that it was a turn off that I said no right off the bat. He also has a problem with the way I look sometimes. I have to be presentable to him (not like top - notch gonna go out) but enough to make me look decent.

&amp;#x200B;

(TL,DR at the bottom BTW :) )

So the deal is sometimes during my last semester I got to know this girl since we started having the same classes together. Our class was small so we had a lot of study group meetups and I got to know her more through that. Outside of the study groups I actually found out she works at a little store on campus so I started coming by often to talk to her and get to know her almost every other day. The first time I went I ended up talking to her for like 2 hours and it was a pretty good conversation. She's probably the only person and girl for that matter that I genuinely enjoy talking to. Let's fast forward to the end of the semester because I don't want this to drag on for too long. At this point we considered each other close friends, but I slowly developed feelings. At first, I told myself it's probably just a crush and I'll get over it, but I'm still writing this sooooo. I decided at the end of last semester to tell her how I feel, which was so relieving to get off my chest, and she told me that she was very stressed from the semester and was not ready for a relationship with anyone  at the moment, but she did appreciate the fact that I came and told her. Now I find that those feeling still haven't gone away. I've gone to lunch and stuff with her sometimes this semester and still stop by her job which I'm probably gonna do today. All I can say is that man I still really like this girl. Probably even more than before. I could list a ton of stuff I like but that's for another time and this getting really long. I thought telling her would fix everything, but now I still can't stop thinking about her. I feel like I'm silly and stupid for being so into her and part of that is probably thanks to my social anxiety, but I just have no idea what to do with my feelings. Any thoughts?"
dating_advice,Does she have feelings for me or is she generally a nice person who has a flirty attitude?,"This might be a teeny bit long....

So I'm a junior and this sweet girl who‚Äôs also a junior in high-school has been giving what I think are hints and I'm not sure what exactly her goal is. We both work at a local store and we talk a lot whenever we're around each other. Some potential signs I've noticed are that she stops what she's doing to be near me. 

There's been times where we're supposed to be ringing people up and if there is nobody present, she'll go towards me and make conversation - this has happened more than a few times. 

Another sign I've noticed is that she will make sure I know she is there, like this one time I wasn't ringing anyone up and I looked up and saw her basically looking in my direction. I didn't realize she wasn't calling for one of our managers because I just stared then looked back to see if she was waiving at me. I thought she genuinely was in need of help, but I missed that signal and we both just laughed it off (she was on register 8 and i was on 3 or something that isn't very close to her btw). 

Third sign ive noticed is that she will be in a playful mood and we'll play around a lot. I make her laugh a lot but I've seen her with other guys, and I'm not sure if she is doing the same to them or not because she seems to have a happy smile with them aswell. All of the other girls who are around my age and I work with have never played around and physically touched me except for one or two, but one of them is just playful with me, and the other is generally a nice person who enjoys conversating with me. 

This girl is the only one I've talked to outside of us working. There's been times where we'll be talking nonstop when we walk to clock out and walk out of the building. There has also been a time where I was walking out and flipped up the peace sign to signal that im leaving, and she asked me to come back and she did the peace sign aswell, but her fingers touched mine and she just smiled... Nothing ive experienced before with a girl, especially when I signal im leaving. 

She is complimenting me on my style and things like that. I wore Christmas sweaters around Christmas time and she said she liked them, but she also said this when I wore a basic chain. i had somewhere to be and she told me that a Spanish speaking woman said she thought my jewelry looked beautiful. I find it weird because why would she be picking up on something someone said about me? I feel thats a strong sign, she also said she wanted to check out the car I drive (we joked around because she couldn't drive before me and I jokingly made fun of her for it). I remember her saying she was gonna watch me walk to my car and pull around to check it out, which I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was being serious because her parent was literally right there in their car. 

I also recall her seeing a friend in an isle and talking to her while she essentially was out of my sight, but i knew where she was. They whispered for a brief moment and im not sure if they were talking about me or not, but i don‚Äôt believe anyone else was on a register at the time. It may have been the same friend, but recently a girl who was with a group of some other girls yelled really loudly and she said my friend likes you, but i was unfortunately looking down at the time so I wasn‚Äôt able to tell if it was directed towards me or not. This girl i like was there btw. 

There are a few more signs I‚Äôve noticed, but these are probably some of the biggest. I just want to know what I should do, and if she is actually into me or not. Im definitelynot the most attractive looking guy but i can definitely be confident even though i used to be a major introvert with a resting b**** face. I always feel like when we are near each other, we have some feelings that I don't see in any other relationships. If you do think she likes me, what would be the best approach to this considering I dont want to ruin our relationship. I'd like to atleast still be cool with each other even through rejection. 

TL:DR
This sweet girl I like thats a junior like me has been giving me what I believe are signs. We joke around a lot in a playful manner, she notices things about me and my style, clothes and makes it obvious she is there. She also stops what she is doing to talk to me or joke around, and will go out of her way to find me sometimes. We talk a lot and she always makes sure to say hi or goodbye if she's near me. I believe her friends have tried to give me signals as well, but I'm not completely sure. Her personality is great, but I want to know if she is into me or just is a nice person."
dating_advice,Is she gay?,"I (M29) like this girl (F26) very much. We‚Äôve been friends for about 3 years now, we talk almost daily. When I first met her, my intentions were ‚Äúromantically‚Äù, many friends told me not to waste my time because they think that either she‚Äôs gay or asexual. I still tried ‚Äúin a way‚Äù and i fell directly into the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù like many others. I like her so much as a person that i don‚Äôt care to be just her friend because we have so much chemistry. But lately I‚Äôve been having feelings for her and I want something more besides being ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù. 
She‚Äôs  very attractive, girly, never had a boyfriend, she doesn‚Äôt drink, and many have tried to make a move and she refuses and blocks that person out of her life. 
I‚Äôve never tried to make a ‚Äúmove‚Äù because im afraid to lose her like apparently, many others. 
She‚Äôs very drastic and cold with her feelings and behaviors. Even though I believe we have a good relationship, I don‚Äôt think she would care to ghost me forever. 
Every time I try to bring out a topic about x‚Äôs or dating she try‚Äôs to change the topic fast. 
Do you think she‚Äôs gay or just very picky? 
Should I try to make a move regardless of the outcome? 
Should I just try to talk it out?

What do I do?,So I‚Äôm a 16 year old male and I‚Äôve asked out a girl before but she kindly declined the offer. This did not bother me but my looks did. The fact that I have a big nose has destroyed the way that I look at myself and this has caused me to think that I‚Äôm probably the ugliest person in my grade and I began comparing myself to others. Now I‚Äôve had this crush on a girl for a while but I don‚Äôt do anything to try to become friends with her mostly because I‚Äôm the kid in all of the regular classes and none of the advanced ones but she is in a lot of advanced ones and just find myself to be ugly and just not smart to date her. I‚Äôve also been over thinking everything such as her talking to other guys and her looking at me. What can I do to change my ideas and just become at least friends with her?
dating_advice,"My (19) FWB (18) wants a relationship, but I don't anymore?","Okay, so I met this girl on a dating app about a month or so ago. I was originally there for dating, but she hit me up, we hit it off and when we met we just had sex and decided to go for a FWB situation since thats all she was looking for atm. 

Now, she's changed her mind and has said she wants a relationship with me because I make her feel good, treat her right, am nice, etc, etc. 

However, now that I've got to know her, shes actually really cool and under normal circumstances I would totally pursue a relationship with her, but her amount of sexual partners has been a massive turn off and makes me have little interest in pursuing further.

According to her, shes used tinder for around 6ish months and has had around 8-10 (cant remember exact number) hookups or other FWB's during that time. On top of her previous relationships (3 but I'm not sure if she had sex with them).

Is there a way to let her down gently or possibly salvage the relationship?"
dating_advice,What is going on?,"[20M] So, she's [18F] a friend of mine but I've liked her as more than that pretty much since I've known her. I spent an entire semester of university flirting (and imo she gave a lot of mixed signals), but I never made a concrete move because she had a boyfriend for most of that semester. Now, there was a time when I stepped back completely (which was followed by an uncharacteristic text from her basically saying ""we're supposedly friends so we can work things out""), but I basically just went back to normal and gave things another go.

Now, by the end of this semester I figured: Okay, she's not into me and I need to step away from this to deal with my feelings, since I see her everyday. I figured I'd send her an audio message so she at least has some context. The jist of it was: I'm into you, I need some time and space to deal with my feelings, I'd say this in person but I don't want to ruin the upcoming trip (we had a big trip with a ton of mutual friends just a few days after I sent the message).

She replied: ""Ok"". I figured that was that. On the trip though, I quickly found out that: 

- She showed or at least told a lot of our mutual friends about the audio (which imo rubs me the wrong way, feels like trying to turn my friends against me).

- She was apparentely not doing great? One of her closest friends pulled me aside and said I was a jerk for doing what I did and that she wasn't doing well. 

Now, I feel like I'm in the right here. I never noticed her ""not doing well"" (she was pretty cold towards me, which I more or less expected) and she never mentioned it herself or tried to talk to me about it (and honestly she could have just replied to the original message instead of acting like everything was okay). I talked to some of my friends and they think what I did was reasonable, but now I'm completely torn and it did end up kind of ruining the trip for me. I feel like she's in this for the attention, almost like I had the responsabilities of a boyfriend without the benefits of one, and that she's more upset about that. 

It's now the week after the trip and we continue not to talk, although every time I've seen her she hung near me and looked happy. Hell, ""too happy"" compared to her usual self.

dating_advice,I (m26) habe feelings for a coworker (f29) and I think it‚Äôs Mutual but she‚Äôs very hard to read.,"So I‚Äôm in a for me strange situation. 
I have feelings for a coworker and it started when I was still in a relationship - she‚Äôs single. We are pretty close and completely on the same wave length. She‚Äôs stuck in my mind since the first day I saw her. She was dropping hints, small things that gave me the impression that the feelings might be mutual. Recently I broke up with my girlfriend and it made me and my coworker even closer I think so there might really be a chance that we could be together. 
She‚Äôs a complex person though and sometimes so hard to read for me. 
It‚Äôs a back and forth kinda. Small touches here and there, texting with each other etc then another time she seems more distant again. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm overthinking some reactions especially the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù ones but overall the situation is messing with my head because at this point I feel like I want to be with her so bad. 
To me it seems as though she‚Äôs waiting for me to make the next crucial step and I feel like if I don‚Äôt talk to her and tell her openly what I think that she might lose that spark again. I don‚Äôt want to miss a chance. 
There‚Äôs so many examples that I could list - signs from her that seem to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm attracted to you!‚Äù but I‚Äôm bad with dealing with emotions. Sorry English is not my first language. 
What do you guys think? I think I should just talk to her about it but it‚Äôs tough to find a good time and place outside of work..."
dating_advice,To disclose or not to disclose?,"Hi Reddit!

I (25f) ended my LTR last year and started dating someone (24m). We had a nice fling for a few months, it ended, and now I‚Äôm dating again.

I went on a few lackluster dates, and then I clicked with someone new (24m). I kind of like this guy.

My problem: He is in the same industry as the last guy doing the exact same thing. Literally, they‚Äôre both touring musicians playing the same instrument. I‚Äôm wincing just thinking about it. My attraction to them has nothing to do with what they do for a living; I genuinely like them as people. And I‚Äôm also a freelance creative, so we can relate to each other on that level but aren‚Äôt in direct competition. 

Anyway, these guys don‚Äôt know each other, but it‚Äôs a close-knit industry. There are people‚Äînot many, but definitely a few‚Äîin their respective circles who overlap.

This brings me to my question. Should I tell the new guy about the last guy so that he finds out from me rather than someone else? I just don‚Äôt want to seem like some weird groupie with a fetish for guys who play this one instrument. 

Thanks for your input."

dating_advice,Should I let him go?,"(UPDATE, and long text warning, and sry englisch ) 

&amp;#x200B;

So I wrote here a while ago and asked how I should do with a guy I met at the gym. Most of the time we just watched each other and smiled before we actually dared to talk to each other. I always go around daydreaming so I noticed him when I was between sets and felt watched, looked up and met his eyes. When we started to speak he was very cautious and was sometimes unsure of what to say. He asked if I was competing in fitness and that he would like to do that to but he didn‚Äôt have the time for the moment.

To be perfectly honest, both were pretty nervous, I think. He didn't even take the treadmill next to me but let it be one in between when he would come and talk to me at first, then it became quiet now and then as we looked for something to say. He came and talked several times a little shy before asking if we could do something someday. I explained, just because I wanted to be honest, that I had just finished a relationship and that it was too soon. He interpreted this completely wrong and said that I could grab him in the gym if I changed my mind. So the next day I went to him and said that we can come up with something to do in a couple of weeks.

He seemed happy and when I asked what he wanted to do, he shrugged, looked at the floor, looked at me, smiled and then suggested a walk so we could get to know each other. Which seemed to be a great idea, as I dont want it to go too fast.

Then I left him alone and on the way out I swung past the receptionist, I have seen him talk to her a bit, don't think they have anything going on when he walked up to me right in front of her but I still wanted to check with her if he was ok, just so I knew if I could trust him not to be a jerk and that he would not try anything, plus I wanted to see her reaction if he have been flirting with her as well or something.  But she just smiled and said I didn't need to worry. 

It was now 5 weeks ago. And we didn't change numbers or anything as I was convinced he would show up at the gym again. And he didn't give me his number either. Or name‚Ä¶.

So I asked Reddit what to do and got suggested that I should talk to the receptionist to find out, or get a clue where he went. So I talked to her today and just asked were this guy went. She didn't understand which guy first and then just looked at me .... maybe skeptical (?) and asked if he didn't give me his number when he asked me out. 

I replied that he didn't,  she shrugs and replies that there are more guys ... Nothing if she has seen him or not. And I have a little trouble judging whether she hiding something for me or not. So I left it there because she would have told me if she wanted to.

But should I just let this go him now? We looked at each other for months before we started talking and I have never met anyone this way before that I actually wanted to go out with‚Ä¶. And now he just disappeared? Everytime our eyes have met I have sort of got stuck in them‚Ä¶ and I cant get him out of my mind? He doesn‚Äôt seem like a player when he has been very kind, before we got to talk he just swung by in the gym a couple of times in the middle of a set I could hear a question ‚Äúare u using this?‚Äù ‚Ä¶.and I would see him there looking at me with a  gym equipment or something in his hand,  ‚Äúwhat ? oh‚Ä¶ no u can take it‚Äù and then he would go away. That happened a couple of times. Maybe he just wanted those things I don‚Äôt know. But there were other people there he could ask but he only asked me if I were using the gym-things (sry englisch). 

And now I am also worried that the staff at the gym will talk behind my back ... the receptionist seemed so off towords me? Or maybe im just imagining ?  

So it might feel akward to go there again but it may also be lack of my self-confidence.

Now what? Im just letting him go ? or I wait? Continue to workout and he might show up?"

She's like a sister to me, I consider myself a brother to her.

The thing is, when you have a beautiful young girl hanging out with you.. Sometimes things evolve in an unintended way. I acted as the adult: we talked it over, cleared the skies and we resorted to radio silence till the thing blew over.

We've been back in touch for a couple of months now. But every time I mention an interaction with a female, my friend tends to throw comments like ""Wow, she must like like you!"" or stuff like that. Every. Single. Time. 

It's just not that, when I mention that I've even talked to one of the GF's of my own friends, she tends to get jealous and starts flinging comments about how my friends shouldn't let their GF's talk to me.

A while back I had an old friend over for dinner, also a female. We were sipping wine and watching terrible movies like we did back in the days. Nothing romantic, just friends having fun. My lady friend had some kind of make up event at a store she went to and sent me pictures throughout the entire day. When me and my old friend were getting quite hammered, the doorbell rang. It was my bestie, coming to show off her make up. I literally had 50 selfies of her face already. It felt like she was there to size up the competition.  


I'm not going to lie. Every time she pulls stuff like this, I feel like she's trying to reignite the flame that took me some real effort to put out. 

Is there another way, other than just dropping her entirely, to get this stuff to stop?"
dating_advice,Should I be concerned,"I started dating a girl 3 months ago. I think I really like her and she likes me too. When we got more intimidate then she told me about that she used to smoke cigarettes but she left it and now she does vaping occasionally. It was very unusual for me cause I don‚Äôt smoke and I am probably concerned about her health, I requested her to quit vaping and I even told her that if you need any help I would help you. But whenever we talk about smoking and stuff like that it makes me feel very worried about her. Should I really be concerned or no? Cause I know she is a adult and has her own life even out of me but I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm very worried about it!"

dating_advice,How do you get to know someone from your professional sphere?,"Recently I (26F) have been noticing a cute guy who doesn‚Äôt work at my same company but works at a firm that assists my company on various projects. We‚Äôre about the same age and we have a nice rapport the times that we have worked together, but we don‚Äôt see or know each other outside of this context.

dating_advice,When will the hurting stop,So about 2 months ago my gf (been together for about 3 years) broke up with me and we both go to the same university. Today I saw her walking down the street and I almost broke down crying. Why does it still hurt to see her? I would appreciate any and all advice. Thanks
dating_advice,I don't know where someone (27F) I'm dating and I (28M) are at right now,"Hey guys, so I'm not sure where a girl and I are at right now.  I want to consider us dating, but I'm not even sure if we are dating at the moment.  I'm a little insecure and don't know how to live in the moment, instead I live for the future when it comes to potential relationships, and I can't predict anything serious coming out of this right now though she DOES say she wants something serious eventually.  She just doesn't want it right now, she'd rather get to know me more.

The first couple of times, she seemed really into me.  It didn't seem like anything was going to get in the way, like other guys.  Always complimenting me on how good looking I am, how exceptionally self-aware I am, always saying she wants to cuddle or make out.  Now it's a little different (maybe because we're more comfortable with each other)?  We've known each other for about 3 weeks and we saw each other 3 times, I'd like to call the 3rd time a date.  Now that we've had sex, she says that she's enjoying our time together.  Not about missing me, wanting to cuddle or kiss or hug.  She loves attention, and I typically give her that, so I don't think this is a case of severe smothering.  I know she's usually busy with work or busy with a previous job that she does from time to time over the weekends.

What I want to know is how can I get on the same page as her but also know what the outcome of all of this will be so I can avoid getting hurt and explore my options on the dating scene?  Is she just looking for the ""next best thing""?  Because right now I'm only talking to and seeing her.  Thanks!

dating_advice,I (18M) like girl. Girl (18F) likes me. What do now?,"I‚Äôm 85% sure she likes me. She lives at home. I‚Äôm living at university for the next 2 months, before moving back where I‚Äôll be way closer. The wait is agonising. I‚Äôm not going to see her much, if at all in the next two months. We text a decent amount. Do I tell her I like her? If so, how?"
dating_advice,"Should I be holding out hope? She wants to call it off because bad timing, thoughts about her ex, and Kobe Bryant.","
I (30M) met her (28F) through mutual friends a few months ago. I ended a 3 year relationship in September. I knew she had also been in a relationship recently but didn't know details until this past Monday.  

By December, we were firmly on each other's radar as we would both go to a mutual friend's house most Sundays to watch football. One night, the 4 of us (me and my friend, my friend's fiance and her) went out. We had some drinks but nothing crazy. We both crashed there but initially in different rooms. She knocks on my door and comes in saying she ""feels bad"" I got the worse bed. Of course we both know what's going on, she asks to cuddle which we do for a while and eventually make out a bit but not much more. She sleeps in the bed with me that night.

I ask for her number in the morning and text her later that afternoon. We text on and off for a couple weeks and then i see her again in a public social setting where we talk and that's it. We go on a few dates, and start hooking up. Only she's actually a virgin, so we get naked and cuddle and do everything PIV. World class BJ's.

So things progress, we have a great time this weekend. I get a we need to talk text Monday afternoon. She comes over, says she can't continue to date me the way she has because she is still dealing with the fallout of her last relationship which ended at the end of October. 

What changed?

Kobe Bryant. Her ex was a huge Lakers fan and had met Kobe through work and introduced her to a few players also. They were together 6 months but friends/on and off for 3 years. Basically it was kind of an underlying thing she felt was under control and then Kobe's death just rattled her so much that she feels like it's a mistake to get serious when she's feeling this way.  

She's says she's into me but the timing isn't right, I believe her but have to think she wouldn't be pulling back if we were on the same page.

We ultimately decided she'll take a week without contact and come over to tell me where she's at. I don't if it's a good solution. Not expecting a great outcome.

Oh also we're in the same wedding in 3 weeks. So that'll be interesting.  

I really like this girl and even though it's technically a rebound for both of us, I can see a future with her. I'm in a holding pattern until Monday but I have a bad feeling I know what will happen.

Should I just back away emotionally as much as possible and prepare myself for it never happening? I want to hold out hope but don't want to end up being even more hurt by it."
dating_advice,What does it mean??,"A guy (50m) has been showing interest in me (46f) lately by showing up to places where I'm hanging out socializing with friends and texting. He's handsome, funny and very complimentary to me and has seemed to be very open. Last night we were at a live music jam and again, he was very sweet but that turned into a lot of sexual talk, things he wants to do to me and such. While I'm flattered and will be totally down in time with the things he's talking about, I started to wonder which path he was going down, one night stand/FWB/relationship?. I tried to feel him out on it and he said ""Don't overthink it"" and basically cut me off by not talking about it, just saying ""Don't overthink it"".  (Now I'm obviously overthinking it!)
What does that mean??"
dating_advice,"Great date from my perception (29M), but she wants nothing further (27F)","Hi everyone, so I recently went on a date that I thought went really really well. I‚Äôm usually quite nervous on dates and I distinctly remember thinking to myself mid-date ‚ÄúYou can officially stop being nervous, this is going great‚Äù. Which, for me, is a somewhat uncommon thought to have mid first date. So okay the date happens, I‚Äôm over the moon in many ways as one usually feels after a good date. I go home, wait a bit, and then text her the ‚ÄúI had a great time, lets get together again, etc‚Äù line. And she responded with telling me she had a great time but does not see this going any further. Okay, thats fair and I appreciate the straight forwardness.

Now, I understand this is life and I'm not here to try and formulate a theory of what went wrong. If dating has taught me one thing it‚Äôs that you can never fully trust you‚Äôre own perception of things. But I‚Äôm really having a hard time identifying the problem area with this one. She seemed interested, we laughed, we even talked about how most dates are awkward and this one wasn‚Äôt. So I guess my question is for you women out there, can you actually enjoy a date as an interaction alone (that may in some way simulate interest) but not want anything further? Or was it all an act you think? I think I‚Äôm just paranoid that I‚Äôm totally delusional considering my take away was that it was a success. Does this make sense?"

dating_advice,Am I the dick in this situation?,"Broke up with a girl who I had dated one hear and had a very rocky relationship. This was the second time we had broken up and I ended it.

Started seeing this new girl straight away. Very lovely. She really likes me so I told her although things were over with my ex, I didn‚Äôt want to get into anything serious right away and she was ok with that. Very understanding. Two months in, my ex reaches out and asks I‚Äôve been with anyone else. I tell her, it destroys her, I feel awful, and I end things with new girl to go back to my ex who I still love.

Here was the conversation with new girl:

Me: Hey I‚Äôd like to take a break, I‚Äôm sorry. My ex just asked if I‚Äôve been with anyone else and I can‚Äôt lie. I‚Äôve torn somebody‚Äôs heart out and I just want to hide for a while. Thank you for being lovely, this is something I need to work through internally.

New girl: I don‚Äôt know what to say...do what you need to do to feel ok again

We don‚Äôt talk for 5 days. New girl messaged me to ask what‚Äôs happening and that she is feeling hurt by all this. So I end things with her and tell her to move on. This is the part where she got real upset:

Her: I‚Äôm really struggling with this. Not because you‚Äôve ended it but because as soon as your ex doing out, you completely shut me out as if it was all a big mistake and my feelings didn‚Äôt matter. It made me feel so small. I know you‚Äôve hurt someone you care for but I don‚Äôt think you realise how much you‚Äôve hurt me in the process.

Me: I‚Äôm sorry :( I tried to be honest about my situation so this hurt could be avoided :(

Her: You just missed the part where things were unresolved between you two. Whenever I asked, all you told me was that you ended it, you were working through it and these things take time. Had I known, I never would‚Äôve shared the things I did.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say and she messaged me again the following day

Her: I‚Äôm not going to be angry just because I‚Äôm hurt, it doesn‚Äôt achieve anything. I put myself here and I‚Äôll own that. I wish you happiness and I hope we can still leave things positively. 

Me: Hey, sorry I haven‚Äôt known what to say. I‚Äôm sorry for how things turned out. I tried to be honest but I guess it didn‚Äôt work somewhere along the way. Yes I still want to be friends.

Am I the dick in this situation or is she overreacting? I never promised her anything"
dating_advice,Do you think I had an appropriate response?,"A classmate texted me out of the blue saying I have good pictures on my dating profile. So I texted back maybe she should have liked them so we could have matched. 

In person she complained about a terrible date she went on, so I put 2 and 2 together and assumed she was flirting. Do you think I was wrong or right?"
dating_advice,Does anyone else have trouble finding what to talk about with people through tinder versus meeting someone organically ?,"Hello reddit! Im a 20f female and I recently downloaded tinder and has gotten a few matches. Im more of a relationship gal and I made it very clear on my bio and with my matches just so I dont waste my time and theirs. 

I recently matched with this really cute guy, absolute stud, hes former military, currently a personal trainer, very sweet and did i mention really REALLY cute? ... 

anyways we‚Äôve been messaging on tinder and we moved to snapchat which is a good sign right! However I find it kinda difficult to actually make conversation. We already did the slight small talk of where you from, do you work or go to school blah blah blah... 

we have a date up in the air just because our schedules dont link up currently which is fine Im a patient girl. Now my worry is Ive only met all my last relationships through school and it was more organically obviously because we had something in common already (school) versus meeting people online where its literally randoms and its first based off looks. 

I dont know what else to say to this guy? Do i have to snapchat and talk to him everyday till our date or should I just wait till we actually meet in person? Is it a bad sign that i dont know what to talk about with this person? I mean i dont know his humor yet or interests so I dont wanna come off weird or just go in not knowing anything? Am I overthinking? 

I will add that I got out a very serious (and toxic) relationship about 6 months ago. Dont get me wrong the relationship has had a toll on me but I absolutely 100% dont want that person back, i guess i just miss having someone who was my best friend and the intimacy included too . :/  anyways any advice i would love. How do you go about online dating? Do you talk everyday with a stranger till your date or do you actually wait for the day of meeting in person? Im just a confused girl who is probably thinking too much"
dating_advice,I am valuing myself more,"Recently I found myself in a situation where the person I am interested in was tired of waiting for me to close the distance. We were never exclusive but we seemed to reciprocate in our emotional investment of one another. I was going to visit his city and had a job interview scheduled, but he told me he's started to date another girl. That's fine, we can be friends, but he said when I move to his city he'll drop the other girl. 

At first I was flattered, but the more I thought about it the more I realized I don't want to date someone who doesn't like me enough to wait and needs a placeholder. 

I'm glad I found out now and I'm proud of myself for recognizing that I deserve more and I'm not going to settle for this type of person."
dating_advice,I(21F) found a guy(20sM) I met in my fb recommended but I'm too shy to reach out.,"I met this guy on the bus one day, about a month ago now. We got caught behind a train and we just struck up a conversation. He seemed nice, and we clicked I guess. As we were approaching his stop there was a moment of visible hesitation, but in the end we just said bye and that was that. Now he's popped up in my fb recommended and I'm not sure if I should just leave it or say hey. I feel like reaching out would be creepy at this point, and my wanting to reach out is only based on one conversation. And I'm aware that there are plenty of options out there, so it doesn't just come down to him. But then again, what if I regret not trying at least. What should I do? And what should I say, if anything?"
dating_advice,Don't worry about a second text coming across as clingy/needy.,"So I went out with a girl twice so far and we had a great time, kissed goodnight on the first, had dinner at her place and made out on the 2nd date and cuddled while watching shows. However she isn't the best at texting. Even before our first date when I was confirming plans I shot her another text a day after to see if she was still down and she replied. Texting in between dates frequently had her taking hours and even days to reply. 

So fast forward to setting up our 3rd date and I asked her on Monday if she was still interested in getting together this week after she she hadn't replied to my previous text about something mundane (We had talked about it at the end of our 2nd). She replied 5 hours later saying she would like to. Then I asked what days she's free. She took almost a full day to reply that she's only free Thursday. Then when I propose a plan and say ""Sound good?"" on Tuesday night she hadn't responded up until now (almost 48 hours). 

I was upset and angry yesterday about her not responding and feeling like I'm about to get ghosted, and had to resist the temptation to text her something curt and confrontational about her lack of investment. Then I remembered we had only been out twice and she didn't owe me an immediate reply.

Today rolls around and still no response so I figured it was over, but I figured I might as well send a text before the end of the work day since I have nothing to lose. So I sent ""Looks like I'm going stag tonight! Lol"". Not even 30 seconds later she responds ""Nooooo, I'm sorry I'm a poophead. Wow.

So just goes to show if a girl is being very slow to reply, don't get angry and send a mean text. Be patient and send her a follow up a day or 2 later if you're feeling it. Had I sent what I was feeling yesterday, she would have backed out. 

I realize this doesn't look good on her either with the terrible communication, but at least I have the chance to see her again tonight and I will talk to her about future communication. 

Cheers!"
dating_advice,Should I sleep over?,"So I (20F) have been seeing this boy (22) and we had 2dates.
For 3date he suggested that I go and stay over at his place and he cook for me. I am a virgin and I want to wait till I get comfortable enough with someone and trust someone to have my first sex with them. 
So my question is do guys only invite you to stay over for having sex or doing something more than just cuddling/ kissing? ( he knows I'm a virgin and want to keep it with untill the right moment)

And should I accept his invitation?"
dating_advice,34yoF x 35yoM. I think I fucked up bigtime. Should I pursue him?,"I have a history with a friend. We dated and it failed. He told me he loved me and took my rejection badly at first but we stayed friends. 4 months after getting to know the guy slowly, I fell madly in love.

I got up he courage to tell him one night. Tragically, he also told me the same night he had hooked up with a friend on a vacation and they were going to go live together halfway across the country. He ended the conversation with ""otherwise youre amazing and I'd date you."" Ouch!!!

I took this really hard. I'm still 100% in love with him and although he told me to ""come back as a friend"" once I'm ready, I'm traumatized at the idea of being around him without being in a committed relationship with him.

Ive since stopped talking to him out of self-protection.

1 week ago a good mutual friend told me that his fling fell though 1 week ago. He's single again.

I still have intense feelings for him and keep daydreaming and hoping he'll walk through my front door.

My question is- whose court is the ball in?

I've been unable to be friends with him and stopped being close due to my intense feelings. I would love nothing more than to be with him, and last time we spoke, that was very clear.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. He KNOWs I am into him and at least in the beginning he was very much into me. Should I break the silence or wait for him, and if it's in my court, how do I even start???"
dating_advice,Why does he seem so cheap?,"So this is going to sound bad. But I‚Äôve been seeing a new guy (both early 20s) for the past few weeks. He is super into me and heavily pursued for a while and we finally went out.

The first date, he didn‚Äôt pay or even make a move to the wallet. I was really irritated considering he pushed so hard for the date. But I liked him so we went out again. Second date, he paid for the first round but seemed very subtly bothered. Kinda like the check came
and after it sat there for a bit he put his card down. After that, we alternated back and forth for the rest of the night. Third date, we sat at the bar for 10 minutes before I prompted that we should get a drink. When it was time for the second one, he was weird about it again so I ended up buying them.

I don‚Äôt understand this at all. He‚Äôs definitely into me. And he works in the same industry as me except a slightly more high profile job so he has to make the same or more. His apartment is super freaking nice. He also never dresses up on dates. For someone who is pursuing hard, this behavior confuses me.

I‚Äôm a modern woman and clearly patient considering I keep going out with him. But I want to be treated once in a while at the beginning stages. When we are in a relationship, I‚Äôll go halfsies and venmo all day. But this makes me not want to go out and eat, for instance, because if he asked me but then expected me to pay the bill for a dinner I‚Äôd be annoyed."
dating_advice,"Based on social media, how can I know if someone is interested in me [29M].","Hello everyone,

Let me speak a bit of myself: I'm a 28 years old man. I'm doing a PHD in mathematical-physics and i have been professor in a small university in my hometown for around a year. I recently (1 month approx.) break up with a girlfriend. We had a 2 year relationship of the break and comeback type. After the fourth break up, I started to go to therapy and visit a psychiatrist in order to move on from that relationship.

Now, the subject: 

There is this girl (K) and we follow each other in instagram. We are from the same town so we have seen each other a couple of times but we limit ourselves to do eye contact and keep walking. The past two weeks I haven been uploading stories on instagram. Basically, every morning I post a photo of me as I meditate with some song in the background. But, essentially, is almost the same picture of my every day. 

I started to notice that ""K"" watches my stories everyday but she does not interact. This is, she does not send me a text or a reaction. I usually like their photos but not instantly. 

Does it mean something if she sees the story every day even if it is a boring one?

Should I say ""hi""?

Remark: we just know each other from instagram. I do not know her lastname or if she's a student of if she works somewhere. We are kind of strangers who follow each other silently.

Thank you, in advance, for you kindness, support, and positive vibes. 

This community has helped me through a lot, and I hope to some day, return the favor to you.

Yours,

./Vic"
dating_advice,How does one *be* an interesting/exciting person? Because just doing interesting and exciting things doesn‚Äôt seem to cut it.,"Title. I‚Äôve taken the oft-given advice of take up hobbies and interests to make my life more fulfilling and give yourself more things to talk about. For me, that included getting into racing cars on track, joining a community orchestra, learning cooking and taking up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (and even winning my first tournament!)

In terms of fulfillment (and keeping me busy), that‚Äôs been a rousing success. 

That hasn‚Äôt translated to me myself being more interesting or exciting. Still don‚Äôt seem to inspire any sort of ‚Äúbutterflies‚Äù or ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù, or w/e. I‚Äôve got lots of stories to tell, but they always seem to fall flat. I used to be a journalist, so I‚Äôm pretty good at active listening and asking follow up questions too, so it‚Äôs not as if I‚Äôm just waxing a soliloquy at them. 

Unsurprisingly, this results in me getting some initial interest, but not being able to hold or build on it, and getting told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an awesome guy, I‚Äôm just not sure we‚Äôre compatible‚Äù. Frustrating, mostly because I don‚Äôt really understand what I need to fix, never mind how."
dating_advice,Am I making a mistake hurting new girl to go back to my ex?,"We dated for one year. Within that time we went on quite a few breaks, and broke up and got back together. We broke up for the second time two months ago, when I ended things.

I started seeing this other girl almost straight away. A girl I‚Äôve known for quite some time. We‚Äôve always had a special connection and there‚Äôs always been something different about us. I told her I wasn‚Äôt in a place to get into something serious right away and she was ok with that. At first it was really great. I absolutely love her company...she‚Äôs clever, funny, kind, mature, just to name a few. Everything you‚Äôd ever look for in a girl. But I obviously still wasn‚Äôt over my ex. Though our relationship was rocky, it only just ended and I still love her. Every now and then I‚Äôd feel these deep feelings of regret and sadness for ending things and I couldn‚Äôt tell if these were just normal feelings after a breakup.

Last week, my ex started talking to me and asked me if I‚Äôd been with anyone else. I couldn‚Äôt lie so I told her and it absolutely tore her heart out. I felt so awful. I felt so so awful. I told the new girl, who had been so lovely to me, that I wanted to take a break and a few days later I ended things with her to go back to my ex. She was so hurt. Got really upset and said I should‚Äôve told her things were unresolved with my ex before she shared the things she did. All I could say was I‚Äôm sorry but I never promised anything. I‚Äôm a dick, I know.

What is going on here? Should I really be going back to my ex or is it just guilt and sadness pushing me back to her? Am I making a mistake ruining something good to go back to an unstable relationship? It‚Äôs only been two months since we broke up and I‚Äôm worried that I haven‚Äôt allowed myself the time to work through it properly. Are my feelings clouding my judgement? The last thing I want is to fall back into the same pattern and end up going through the breakup all over again.

I know this might all sound stupid, but it‚Äôs hard to get out of your head sometimes and see things objectively. Just looking for some advice. Thanks guys.

TL;DR: Broke up with GF of one year who I had a very unstable relationship with. Started seeing a lovely girl straight away. Two months later, told ex, broke her heart. Feel awful. Still love ex. Ended things with new girl to get back with ex. Am I going back to an unstable relationship for the wrong reasons? Is two months apart enough time?"
dating_advice,What does a mean if a guy says his dick is all mine?,"Im seeing a guy casually right now. I've known him a couple of years. He just got out of a divorce a year ago and he has 4 kids, so he said that he wants to keep it casual and low expectations and we will just see how it goes. We have hung out a couple of times. I just saw him last night and we had sex. Before we had sex I told him I loved his dick, and he replied ""well, it's all yours!"". Does that sound like it means he's only having sex with me. Or that I'm free to do what I want with it? I like him a lot, so if that's what he meant I don't want to date other guys and ruin things. He said he doesn't like to play games. I don't either. Im 31 and he's 36. Opinions? I probably won't see him for a couple of weeks bc we are both busy and I'd rather ask him about it in person. So im just curious what it could mean."
dating_advice,Dental Hygiene,"So, I think after all the time I‚Äôve spent dating this past year the most important thing for me is their dental hygiene. 

I‚Äôve gone a few dates with guys who are great, cute, we have chemistry, good job, etc. But nothing kills all of that quicker than having yellow teeth with plaque. Honestly it is the biggest turn off. Recently I went on a great date with a guy (3-hour first date!), scheduled a second and that‚Äôs when I noticed the plaque on his lower teeth. 

And that was it..... completely turned off, nothing else mattered at that point I was so grossed out. So, needless to say, I‚Äôm not seeing him anymore. 

Does anyone else share this opinion? Or am I just being ‚Äòweird‚Äô.

sometimes he tells me that he would think about his ex even though they broke up more than a year ago. i also just broke up with my ex a few months ago but i managed to slowly move on from him.

he tells me that he is not interested to be in any special relationship in the meantime but his actions speaks otherwise. sometimes he would act clingy like how my ex used to be. we never meet yet but i hope we will soon. it has been almost two months since we've been talking but i dont want to waste my time like this, without having any relationship going on.

does he really want to be in a relationship with me or it's just nothing? any advice will do! sorry for my english as it is not my first language :("
dating_advice,Girl i‚Äôm seeing went to amateur night at a strip club..?,"So i‚Äôve been seeing this girl and it was her friends birthday a couple days ago and they took a limo to amateur night at a strip club. The girl i‚Äôm seeing told me she ‚Äúdid the worm‚Äù on the stage and some dude came up to her after and told her she had the best dance and gave her 100$. Is it just me or does that sound like a load of shit? She is a somewhat goofy girl so it‚Äôs not surprising to me that she would do the worm, but she‚Äôs really trying to tell me she did it at a strip club AND made money off it? yeah right. Thoughts?"

dating_advice,"How should I handle this? Asked a girl out for today, she can't make it, but didn't suggest another time/day","This girl and I have been talking for a few weeks, last night I asked her if she wants to go hit up this local ice cream place we'd talked about (I asked her for this evening). She texted back saying she can't because she's going to the basketball game today

On one hand, this is on me for bad timing - I actually knew there was a game today, but completely forgot about it when I texted her. On the other, she didn't suggest another day/time for us to go

For what it's worth, this girl has shown a lot of positive signs when we see each other in person (part of the same club on campus). She's also really inexperienced (only one boyfriend, who cheated on her apparently?), a little shy/insecure, and, tbh, sometimes I'm not sure if she knows what she's doing

Part of me feels dropping it is probably for the best for now, cause I really don't think asking again/being ""pushy"" is a good idea with someone like her. Like saying ""Have fun, I'll see you around"" or whatever is probably better than asking for another day

At the same time, I can't shake the feeling that if she's truly interested, she would've suggested another day? But I don't have much experience with shy girls, so idk"
dating_advice,BF(21) and Me(20) are arguing about a dog,"So I'm graduating and moving to the east coast and plan to adopt a dog when I move there because I have the time to take care of the dog and because I will be living alone not near my family for the first time in my life so I want a companion. My bf(21) is graduating the year after me and his plan is to move to the east coast with me and we would get an apartment together.

The issue is the dog. My boyfriend loves dogs and his family has one that he wants to take to the east coast with him. I feel bad saying this because he loves his dog but the dog is mean. The dog only listens to him, is super hyperactive, a biter, and hates me. His job doesn't allow for him to be home a lot but I will be so the dog listening to me is pretty important. The dog doesn't like other dogs and often tries to attack other dogs.

I am not willing to give up adopting a dog and I absolutely refuse to give back the dog if they don't get along. I am trying to convince him to not to bring the dog with to the east coast. It's his family dog so like he wouldn't be abandoning it. I don't know I feel like I'm being a bad person but I also don't want to be lonely and sad in a new place.

Any advice about what to do about the situation where him and I could both win? Any advice please I just feel bad."
dating_advice,UPDATE: I've matched the same guy on three different apps over the last 5 years and it still hasn't turned into a date.,"I brought up this situation in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/eq3om6/ive_matched_the_same_person_3_times_on_different/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and I was looking for more advice on where to go.

After we matched again I texted him a regular Hey what's up how yoo doin? And he responded later that day.

Since then he's been giving me pretty dry texts. Just real casual answers about the kind of music he likes and what he does for fun. No energy or excitement in his texts.

Normally, I would consider this a lost cause and move on. But the feeling I can't shake is that he is kind of interested because why in the Heck would he keep matching me and KEEP responding over and over? Just to be polite? 

He's so cute and I want to ask him out, but I suspect he will not respond if I do. Its possible he just likes talking, and takes a really long time to warm up to someone, so I don't want to rush it. Any advice?"
dating_advice,When should I (32M) cut my losses? The girl (31F) I'm seeing has been acting off.,"About 2 months ago I matched with a girl on hinge, and we hit it off fantastically. 

Due to scheduling constraints we had to wait a week before seeing each other, but when we did it felt like the date could've lasted all night. 

Since then we've had the most amazing dates I've ever been on in my life, I've met her friends, went to their boxing day party, and got invited to her cousin's birthday party. 

It feels like we're dating, but over the past week she's been super spotty with text messaging, missed a call of mine saying she was sleeping, when in reality she viewed my Instagram story shortly after. 

Her texts have gotten shorter with more time in between them. 

I'm tempted to cut it off, but I don't want to do that if she's been having a rough go of it at work or has been sick."

dating_advice,Single Advice,"So I‚Äôve been single for a while now and I know this question is going to seem really dumb but anyways I know you have to work for things in life,  like at work, school etc but do you really have to work to find someone when it comes to dating? Like truly go out there and be bold and do the search? I‚Äôm somewhat of a shy guy so sometime its hard for me to talk to girls with full confidence and I have this ideology that the right one will come to me and not the other way around  but honestly I feel like I‚Äôm getting nowhere with this mindset and wasting my time, maybe even missing opportunities, so do you really have to work hard to find someone???"
dating_advice,Why do girls always like to open up to me? And is it better to just let the girl do the talking?,"So yesterday I was talking to a girl, and this was like the 5th girl I‚Äôve met who somehow brings up that she has no friends, or brings up her anxiety or not fitting in, and i just seemed to notice an interesting pattern. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm shooting myself in the foot by doing this, but I‚Äôve always been pretty good at picking people‚Äôs brains, and play kind of the same role with my guy friends.

I‚Äôve been told a lot that I give off the impression that I‚Äôm very chill and calm (not really the case tbh), and I‚Äôm a tall dude, deep voice, so idk if it‚Äôs just a daddy issues type of thing or something like that. I enjoy these conversations but sometimes it‚Äôs like the girl will just be going off and it‚Äôs too one sided of a conversation. 

Like don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre just not crying on my shoulder, and in yesterday‚Äôs example like we laughed and made jokes as well, and I talked about my future career goals and that type of stuff, but somehow it usually turns to a deeper level which I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good or bad thing. And I think this is one of the reasons people like me a lot more now, bc I usually genuinely care what the other person is saying, and I‚Äôve always liked reading biographies and getting to know peoples ‚Äústories,‚Äù so it‚Äôs a bit of nosiness as well. 

And I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just emasculating myself or if it‚Äôs the good thing to do, but it works well with building friendships and maybe not so much on romantic relationships unless I‚Äôm ‚Äúalready in.‚Äù I credit this to having a good amount of people who invite me places and like to talk to me, and I can do small talk and real life talk simultaneously. I don‚Äôt really know an alternative to this bc I genuinely like hearing most people talk, and I just butt in the conversation when i want to say something, and we go back and forth. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is if it‚Äôs better for me to do the talking, or just let the girl talk and do whatever she‚Äôs going to do. I still makes jokes, try to tease, be playful, and the usually like flirty things, but should I try to create a bette balance of the two or should I just keep doing what I‚Äôm doing?"
dating_advice,Currently seeing someone but I don‚Äôt think I like him enough to date him,So I‚Äôve been seeing the same guy for around 5 weeks now and it‚Äôs becoming more clear to me that we aren‚Äôt compatible to date. We talked about it last night and he agrees but still wants to keep seeing me which confuses me because I would‚Äôve thought it was to continue sleeping with me but he has a lower sex drive than me. He just wants to keep taking me out on dates and we‚Äôre going out to places that I would only go to on a special occasion or birthday. I don‚Äôt understand and even though I like the nice dates I feel like it‚Äôs a waste of time to be seeing someone who I don‚Äôt want to date.
dating_advice,What do I do here?,"I (22M) have been eying up a girl (23F) that I used to work with for a number of months. We met in May of last year and I was immediately attracted to her looks. As time passed, I began to interact with her more and more, and I pretty quickly realised that her personality was even more attractive than her looks. We chatted, talked and teased each other for months at work, and I was fairly content with just having those sort of interactions as I am a fairly reserved and quiet guy that has never gotten much attention from girls. However, I then learned that she would be switching jobs and that I would no longer be seeing her unless I did something about it. Due to my shy nature, I had never asked a girl out before. I have had crushes on a couple of girls throughout high school and college, but I never had the courage to actually man up and ask a girl what they thought about me. 

I had gotten enough signals to indicate some sort of interest from her, but I was still focusing on the signs that would indicate otherwise. She took a very long time to reply to my messages (as in 3 days), and she would often mention to me how awkward it was that other co-workers were hitting on here. Admittedly, she is also probably a little out of my league. I like to say that I am average to below average looking with a good and funny personality, while she will have no problem going into any bar and getting attention.

Fast forward to last week, and I finally had the courage to ask her out. We went out to a board game caf√© and I thought the date went well. There was not any sexual tension, but the conversation flowed, she laughed at my jokes, and I genuinely felt as if she wanted to be there. However, as we were about to leave, she insisted on splitting the bill for the night. This left me confused as she had previously mentioned that guys normally paid for the dates that she had been on. I then started to wonder if she was just being nice, seeing it as two friends going out, or just rejecting me subtly? 

On the way home, she invited me to go out with some of her friends and previous co-workers, so I luckily have the opportunity to talk to her face-to-face again. However, I am really in doubt of what to do now. Do I invite her out again and then more explicitly tell her that it is a date? Or do I interpret the message as a rejection and just continue as friends?"

dating_advice,need a little help here.,"sorry if this is a mess but iam not very good at expressing myself in text form.

found her on tinder and we both matched so i got her snapchat. iam not the most talkative person as i have a hard time finding things to talk about, so it was pretty slow. anyway she asked 3 times if i wanna meet for a coffe but have stood me up the first 2 times but the 3rd time we met at her place.

all we did was watching tv and talk, i think she wanted to do ''more'' but i didn't react much to the hints (what i think was hints) because shes an ex of a friend of mine so i don't wanna risk it just to get laid. sometime after that i asked her if she wanna meet up again but that time she couldn't and neither of us have tried after that.

i get messages from her on snapchat atleast once a day but mostly just a picture with no text. i don't know if she sends those just to get attention and if she sends those to alot of other people or if she wants me to ''do'' something (probably not). i tried to wait wait a couple hours before opening her snaps and in 1,5 day she stoped sending them so i sent a snap to her and then she started again.

i know i should ask her if she wanna meet up but after we met i have shown her that i want to meet her again as i have also asked her to a party not long ago but she didn't feel like it. or maybe she lost interest in me since i didn't respond to her hints when i met her.

hate this overthinking. and i don't need any moral lessons about her being an ex to a friend of mine."

dating_advice,Problem solved. An update,"

So briefly, I (30M) had taken this lady (26F) on a couple of dates but she didn‚Äôt like my truck so she considered not seeing me again. (I‚Äôll post the link to the past one at the bottom)


Anyway......



I decided to ask a little more last night while trying to  plan the dinner. I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. 
I did tell her that if I sounded like a conceded prick I apologize and she said though she felt as though I was being a bit condescending she understood. 
Then she said ‚ÄúI just figured if a guy can pay for the dates and even get my uber to and from the first date he‚Äôd have a nicer car or whatever. Like you can do payments on something for cheap with a credit score like that. I‚Äôm sure you see where I‚Äôm coming from‚Äù

To that I said ‚ÄúOh I could definitely get great payments on a nice truck for sure. But I see that 2020 truck and know that person will lose 60% of the value in 4 years. With interest rates he‚Äôs paying way more than the truck is worth brand new on the lot. If mine breaks down I‚Äôll donate it for a tax break and buy another one with cash. I see where you‚Äôre coming from and the image is of more importance than being free to do whatever you want whenever you want. And that is perfectly fine and normal for most people, I‚Äôm just not that kinda guy. I‚Äôm going pass on dinner ma‚Äôam. It was wonderful hanging out and meeting you though, best of luck.‚Äù

To anyone who took the time from their day to put forth their input I really appreciate it. Though most said run I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. Y‚Äôall were right üòÇ"
dating_advice,How to start dating as an introvert? Where to look for other introverts?,"So I never dated. I wanted to meet someone naturally, but that never happened. So now I think this is the only way. I'm 23 F, pretty introverted with new people but talkative after you get to know me. 

I have only been on one date where the guy kept talking about his ex and himself and that was a waste of time.

So now i'm kind of scared of it. I do get asked out by what seems to be extroverted guys, but i'm too afraid to say yes. I always feel like people don't have good intentions. I just want to find a nerdy kind of introverted person i can relate to. But that seems like impossible on dating apps.

dating_advice,Am I (32 f) dating a narcissist (31 m) ?,"I started seeing a guy I met on okc in December.  Initially when we met things seemed to really click.  We laid our cards out on the table about what we were looking for, and things really seemed to jive.  A month and a half later, and I'm unsure if this guy is really into me or if I'm dealing with a potential narcissist.

He has alluded to the fact that he's selfish and tends to do things in his own best interest.  The example he used is helping his friend move.  While it may seem like a nice thing to do, he keeps in the back of his mind that he can use his friend later.  When he talks about work (military) he talks about manipulating his subordinates into doing things in their own best interest.  The fact that he uses the word manipulate when describing himself already rubs me the wrong way.  Talking on the phone has started to annoy me, as the conversations end up becoming one sided with him taking up a lot of the time.  He has given me the heads up that he knows his personality can be a bit much and he appreciates it when I ask him to tone it down.  He had that self awareness at least. 

In regards to him and I, Im wondering if I'm being love bombed in order for him to ""win"" me over.  He has declared his strong feelings for me again and again, and has even used the L word.  I have emphasized to him that I don't feel the same and need time to catch up, which I feel he has respected a has pulled back a little from. 

I have dealt with a narcissist before and can draw some similarities, but with it being so early I'm wondering if he's just really infatuated with me or if this is the start of something bad.  Is it better to give it a little bit more for me to voice my concerns and give him an opportunity to prove himself, or is it better to cut things loose before feelings get involved?

Tldr; dating a man a little over a month and not sure if there are red flags or not.  Need advice on whether to cut things loose now or give it more time."
dating_advice,I‚Äôm so sick of dating,"I‚Äôm (27F) getting so tired of dating. The constant ghosting, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù, feeling this strong connection and then them coming back and telling me they didn‚Äôt feel a spark. 

This last guy took the cake. I was talking to a guy and off the bat there was this strong connection/attraction. I felt truly hopeful about this guy. We met, and things just rolled. I felt so comfortable, conversation flowed so well. We went out to eat and we were talking so much that the waiter had to come by three times asking if we were ready. We stayed at that diner for two and a half hours before we left. We had sooo much in common. We laughed so hard. He told me things about his personal life, and we got into deep conversations. He told me that he was shocked that I‚Äôve been single. That I‚Äôm gorgeous and look even better than my pics. He told me that he could see something for us in the future. We ended the date on a super good note. 

The next day we didn‚Äôt talk at all. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because I‚Äôm busy, he‚Äôs busy. I finally went on insta and found out that he unfollowed me. Weird, but okay. In reality he had blocked me, he was ghosting me, even after I told him how much ghosting fucked with my head. I called him out in it. He told me that he didn‚Äôt feel any spark and couldn‚Äôt see a future with me. I was really disappointed and so sad. Maybe I‚Äôm naive, for believing such pretty words, but I truly thought that I could see something with this guy. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. This has happened so many times that I‚Äôm starting to think that it‚Äôs me. Dating is really wearing me out mentally. I‚Äôm really at my last limits here.

Any advice on how to get over this hurdle? I want to give up all together and just say fuck it."

I wanted to be closer friends because she deals with shit and i deal with shit and i care about her so much and want to help her and be there for her.

Well, she finds out that i like her and i apologise like a fucking idiot. She's made it clear that she isn't interested in any of that before and i felt that i made her uncomfortable and added more shit to her plate. I'm a fucking idiot, I know.

Anyways, few days ago, I see from her spam on Insta that she's having a tough time, so I ask her what's wrong and if she wanted to talk about it. She says she isn't doing fine and doesn't want to talk. I don't press on. I just give her some advice and move on.

Yesterday, i asked her how it was going ever since then because, yeah, i care about her and want to see her do well. Just a simple ""how's it going?"" message. This morning, she blocked me from her spam.

I don't know what i did wrong. Maybe it was me. She follows my account and i was venting recently because I was going through a rough time. Maybe I pushed her away with my issues or maybe I pushed her away by being concerned for her and i don't know where I went wrong and i don't even know if this is the proper sub to post this in but I'm rambling and I'm typing this out as I go along and i don't know what to do.

dating_advice,My bf wants to fuck his cousin,"Ok so basically, I feel like my boyfriend likes his cousin and won‚Äôt admit it. We were having a deep talk about a lot of things and he has admitted to me that he has a fantasy of fucking his first cousin. He told me a story about how they had a ‚Äúsexual‚Äù encounter when they were kids but it was innocent and happened when they were like 10. And ever since he was in high school he struggled with the fact that he found her attractive( because it‚Äôs very taboo) When I heard this obviously I was shocked but I‚Äôm not one to judge, so I was ok with it obviously because everyone has their fantasies, and they‚Äôre just fantasies right? But recently I found out he had a reddit account where he posted a story about wanting to fuck his cousin and went into great detail. It hurt me, a lot to be honest but still I tried to get over it because I love him and he treats me so well and other than this we really have no problems. But recently I‚Äôve noticed that at family parties, he‚Äôll stare at her and thinks I don‚Äôt notice. He‚Äôll check her out even though he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrealize‚Äù that he‚Äôs doing it. He has admitted to me that he masturbates regularly to her pictures on instagram. And he constantly goes on her profile. If he missed one of her posts he‚Äôll go on her profile just to like the post. Which I guess isn‚Äôt a big deal but it is to me. Cause you‚Äôre going out of your way to go like her picture when it‚Äôs not that serious. Idk it just hurts only cause I know he wants to fuck her. Idk what to do I‚Äôm tired of getting mad at him because of this but I‚Äôm in love with him and our relationship just works so well. Oh, also he has admitted to jerking off to multiple girls that we know, for example my best friend and his sisters best friend. And I still tried to not judge him over that but he has written posts about them in great detail and a lot of the pornstars he watches resemble these girls that we know. He has also followed a bunch of porn reddit accounts and used to comment sexual things on their posts but I still forgave him for that. What should I do ? I don‚Äôt want to keep feeling like I‚Äôm not good enough and just hurt.  But I also don‚Äôt want to end the relationship cause he‚Äôs a really good guy and treats me well"
dating_advice,Where do you guys get the motivation to date from?,"I think my main and only problem dating wise is   just that I cannot compel myself to actually take any action. Sure being single and lonely is a drag, but in the moment the downsides of single-hood are always less  then the downsides  of going out of my social comfort zone, of talking to and asking out a new person. I know rationally, that over the course of my life, the downsides  of never taking action  will be far greater then  all nervousness, discomfort and the anxiety that will come with taking action. But that rational understanding just isn‚Äôt enough to compell me to act in the moment. Just like how, I have a rational understanding that the long term benefits  of flossing outweigh the  daily  annoyance, but that doesn‚Äôt succeed in compelling me to floss. What scares me is that, I‚Äôve been single, and without a date, for a long time now, and it sucks, but it‚Äôs not really getting any harder, month by month, year by year. If things keep going as they are now , it‚Äôs conceivable that faulty pro con calculation going on in my head, leading me to inaction, will stay that way forever.  That I‚Äôll be trapped in this lonely unfulfilling place forever . Right I don‚Äôt foresee any reason anything might change...... Have any of you gotten out of this trap? How did it happen?"
dating_advice,There is a really cute girl (F)who sits next to me (M) in my college class,"Ok so, i used to have horrible social anxiety as a teenager and now as a 21 year old, I am doing wayyyy better at talking to my friends, family, and random people. However when it comes to the dating scene? Not much luck. 

High school I didn‚Äôt have a gf, and last year I had a crush, asked her out, almost got a date but I feel like I waited too long to set anything up and like I asked boring stuff (I‚Äôm really it good with that stuff) so I got ghosted

Now the new semester started and I sit next to a cute girl and I want things to go different. I feel as if I am more mentally and emotionally healthy than ever, and the law of attraction is going to manifest meaningful relationships for me this year. I want to approach this situation with optimism and genuinely get to know her as a friend to see if I connect with her and if I do I‚Äôll ask her out.  Even if things don‚Äôt work out I‚Äôm down to have her as a friend as there are plenty of fish in the sea. 

Admittedly however, I have no idea how to initiate a conversation with a girl and come across genuinely invested in a friendship ( which I of course am ) without letting anxiety or not knowing what to say hold me back.  I want to be respectful too.

I don‚Äôt know If this is the right sub but I find myself wanting to get closer. Any conversation starters that would be beyond awkwardness?"
dating_advice,toxic," I want to apologize, but not for what you think. I want to apologize for letting you believe you could treat me so poorly for so long. I want to apologize to all the girls that will come after me, because you‚Äôll think that they will put up with just as much as I did. I pray they will have more self-respect then I did. Lastly, I want to apologize to myself for letting you make me believe I was worthless, and above all less then. I am now free once again and even though my pain is great, I am learning how to love myself again. 

Never let another person make you feel like you are not important or make you feel pain all of the time. My ex boyfriend was abusive, not in a physical way but mentally. Many told me throughout the years that i deserved better but i never thought i did. Luckily he decided to move 16 hours away because he wanted a different life, if he wouldn't have that i don't that i would've had the strength to walk away from him myself. It does hurt still but i'm learning how to love myself and focus on the people who truly care about my well being. I hope that anyone feeling this way has the strength to be the one to walk away first. This is my first post so i hope its not that bad."
dating_advice,Finding the right guy,"Soo I need some advice here....I‚Äôm 22 years old and I‚Äôm still a Virgin. I had done other sexual stuff with my ex boyfriend but I drew the line after a certain point because I didn‚Äôt feel ready to go further. He stopped putting in effort because I wasn‚Äôt going further but to be honest I think he just ‚Äúdated‚Äù me to try to get in my pants. I‚Äôm not hot, but I am attractive and cute and he told me that I‚Äôm the prettiest girl he‚Äôs been with. He told me he did have feelings for me but I am not sure. Does anyone think he was just infatuated with me? Even though I broke up with him, he wants me to hookup. A part of me is tempted because I feel like I‚Äôm ready to have sex yet at the same time I want to do it with someone who loves me for me and doesn‚Äôt wanna date me just because I‚Äôm pretty and a Virgin. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve come across guys who wanna hook up with me even though I told them that I was a Virgin. It‚Äôs almost as if they have a fetish for virgins idk. I feel like my ex just wanted to pop my cherry to boost his ego. Any advice and opinions is greatly appreciated!"
dating_advice,Is she interested in me?,"We‚Äôre both seniors in high school. We‚Äôve started talking since seniors year, hung out once on New Year‚Äôs Eve and all of sudden she stopped talking to me. My friends say that I should let her some space, so I didn‚Äôt text her for like a week and a half( I still say hello when we meet at school). 
This Wednesday she sent me a hello and ask why did I stop talking to her, she thought that I have busy time and told her self not to bother me, I then replied that I thought the same thing. This morning she sent me a text like that she‚Äôs bored. 

Did she actually think that I busy and don‚Äôt want to bother or she ghosted me? And seems like she texts me back, how often should I text to her? Should I text her everyday?"

dating_advice,"I (M35) really want to date this girl (F26) from Volleyball, but how do I find out if she is into me, without ruining the friendship we have?","So I (M35) play beach volleyball and I joined a newly opened beach volleyball group in the city I live.  I got put in a Whatsapp group with active players so u can find players to pay whenever you want.   
After the summer a small group ( including me) joined an indoor practice group for the winter time and one of the girls I(F26) in that group I really started to get along with.  We share a lot of interests and started texting a bit , but since a few weeks we pretty much text every day. We both have a passion for food and  last week we went out to a cool restaurant and although nothing happened I noticed that I think I have a crush on her.  And I keep asking myself: 'am I on a date, or just out with a friend? '  
Now the problem is that I don't know if she just likes me as a friend or if she is into me too?  And because we play volleyball in the same group at the same club, I fear that if I misjudge it , I would make it weird and uncomfortable for her or for me.  And I know volleyball is really important for her and for sure it is important for me so I don't want to ruin that for either of us.   


I would be ok with just a friendship too, because we have a great chemistry in the group , but I for sure don't want to miss the opportunity if there is more, because I really like her.   


I hope you guys can help a bit !"
dating_advice,Paranoid,"My boyfriend has been pretty distant lately mainly because of a miscommunication I made a few days ago. 
His messages are blunt and he says he says there‚Äôs no point in talking if everything we talk about is argument related. 
I told him I was going to work at thinking about the conversation outcomes before I speak. 
He kind of ignored that thought and said if you want to call me or text to argue then go ahead. We talked last night and he just left me hanging with a ‚Äúttyl‚Äù when I said goodnight and I love you. 
Is this normal after an argument? I think he is just really mad..... or should I be worried about other things, like him cheating or lying?"
dating_advice,Two big red flags... to end things or wait it out,"So I‚Äôve been talking to this guy since December and we met in January ~ 3 weeks ago. We have been on 4 dates. I know I wanted a long time to ask him why he‚Äôs on the dating apps and what he‚Äôs looking for, but I‚Äôm glad I asked. On our first date he had mentioned that his ex broke up with him ~ 3 months ago and he was devastated. That was a red flag to me right away. I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt over her.... then after asking him his intentions he had mentioned that he‚Äôs been doing his best to move on but it‚Äôs been difficult. That makes him question why‚Äôs he‚Äôs even on the apps and why he‚Äôs even with me if he‚Äôs still hung up on his ex. He did say that he‚Äôs looking for someone to spend time with and if he connects well with them he‚Äôs open to things leading somewhere. So I do like this guy, but I‚Äôm really tired of things not going well with guys. I was very hopeful at first and now I feel like I‚Äôm just going to be a rebound which I do not want. We do have a ton of things in common... and I feel like we are a really great match.... but I feel very conflicted as to what to do at this point. Any advice?"
dating_advice,A guy(M30) I(F26) met online posted a picture of us and I want him to remove it without looking like a creep,"TL;DR: A guy I was on a date with suggested we take a selfie, I accepted. Halfway through the date he tells me he's polyamorous, I lose interest. Later I dig and find his social media, he actually posted our picture. I don't want my picture with him online, what do I do ? 

I met this guy on bumble, we decided to go on a date the very next day, everything was going well and we were getting along very well, I live in a very touristy city, and since he was new here I was kind of giving him a tour. 

We made it to this really nice spot and he suggested we make a selfie, and I accepted. 
So this guy, I only have his number, no social media. 

Halfway through the date he starts speaking about his GIRLFRIEND, I was confused and that's when he said that he's polyamorous. 
If I had known this I wouldn't have accepted to meet him. 

Fast forward to this morning, I decided to find out more about him, I managed to find both his Facebook and Instagram, and guess what, he actually posted our picture on his Facebook without asking me, he doesn't even have me as a friend. 

I want to ask him to remove the picture, in the same time I don't want him thinking I'm a creep for stalking him online or finding his social media (I admit I'm really good at that) 

Any advice ?"
dating_advice,Does it seem that white women in interracial relationships are liberal because they hate white guys and equate them as Nazis?,"Tell you what, I‚Äôm going to ask 100 interracial couples (white girl/minority guy) as a CNN reporter with the following handbook:

‚ÄúIf the election for November 2020 was held and the candidates were [1] or [2] who would you vote?‚Äù

1. Bernie Sanders
2. Donald Trump

Or I could ask this:

‚ÄúDo you support impeaching President Trump?‚Äù

I tell you, so many white women have become race traitors. Heck, at least 40% of them will vote for any Democrat like AOC because they hate Trump and America so much.

dating_advice,Should I just lose interest in something more in the future? Is he genuine?,"Hi everyone! Just writing this to get people's opinions. This guy (m21) and I (F21) had been actively dating for around a month but then he told me he didn't want to continue in the same direction that we had been going in due to his parents going through a separation. I completely sympathise with him and explained that I'd still be here for him etc.

I'll copy the text thread down below.

Him -  ""Listen, I just feel I need to tell you because I don‚Äôt want to lead anyone on at all but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to be dating anyone or anything anytime soon, I just found out my mums wanting a separation from my dad that night I came to see you and had to call my dad too check up on him, it‚Äôs a whole process between them moving out and getting a new place and shit that they‚Äôre both expecting to happen sometime soon, it really is just the worst time for me to focus on anything serious, I do enjoy talking to you though and I‚Äôm interested in still talking just not anything serious if you‚Äôre okay with that?""

Me - ""Aw I'm sorry to hear that! I'm always be here to talk if you need too that's okay!"" 

Him - ""i dont want to act like an asshole and talk to you still and have you think that I‚Äôm wanting a relationship or anything at the moment, I feel horrible telling you I don‚Äôt because we get on so well it‚Äôs just the worst timing ever for me to be in this position, I hope you understand""

Me - ""I'm obviously really gutted but I 1000% understand! Like you're going through a hard time and you've got to be there for yourself and your family. Don't worry about it!"" 

Him - "" Yeah I don‚Äôt want to be the type to leave it for ages and then tell you at the worst possible time, i felt like I owed it too You to tell you, it‚Äôs just not a good time, some friend told me just to ghost but I know I‚Äôm not like that and I never could, I really hope you don‚Äôt take this in a bad way, you are a really great girl"" 

Me - ""Yeah thankyou for telling me I appreciate it"" 

Him - ""I‚Äôm still here to talk or hang out with anytime though, it‚Äôs not like I want to cut you out of my life or anything"" 

Me - ""Aw Awright sounds good"" 

Him - ""I‚Äôll give you sometime to think about things, I can only assume you don‚Äôt want to talk to me about everything at the moment, I‚Äôll message you tomorrow when I wake up, And honestly, just so you know, this is the first time I‚Äôve ever been through this, in terms of telling a girl I‚Äôm not interested in a relationship or anything and it really isn‚Äôt something I enjoy, especially when I‚Äôm talking to a girl as interesting and nice as you"" 

Me - ""I don't really know what too say to that but thankyou haha, sorry for being blunt"" 

Him - ""It‚Äôs okay, I wouldn‚Äôt have much of a response either being messaged something along these lines.... don‚Äôt worry about being blunt. You have every right too!"" 

Me - ""Right I'm upset about it but I understand and I still want to chat and meet cause id like to be pals cause we get along so well I wouldn't want to just throw that away. it would be especially shit of me if I did just because you are doing what you need to do. I want to be there for you and all that! I just hope I haven't done anything wrong or put you off or anything for you to feel this way aswell""

Him - ""I‚Äôm really glad you feel that way and want to talk still, id love to hang out with you when I can, you have To believe me that nothing you have done has put me off, you are an incredible girl, I‚Äôm just at the worst position I could be right now, please please please don‚Äôt feel Down about it"" 

Me - ""Okay good! I'm glad you told me so I'm not thinking this is going somewhere when it's not and we can still be freinds!"" 

Him - ""Yeah I am the worst at dealing with anything like this but you‚Äôre someone I felt I needed to explain things to and let you know it‚Äôs nothing to do with you, you really are special, you‚Äôre so much fun but I‚Äôm glad you understand where I‚Äôm coming from"" 

What I'm wondering is does he seem genuine? I have a hard time telling good from bad and fake from real with people due to my last relationship. I really feel like he is.

My freinds who don't know him said that he is just using that as an excuse because he's lost interest and doesn't like me in that way anymore. 
Do yous think so from the texts? 

I know I probably sounds like a weirdo but I just want it kind of cleared up in my head cause I do really like him and hopefully in the future we could try dating again but I don't know if I can see it from his side after what my friends said. 

Me and him still meet up and hangout also talk everyday. So if he really didn't like me, he wouldn't hang out with me at all. 

Thankyou for any opinions and sorry if it's immature. I just have a hard time reading people and can't always trust my friends opinions."
dating_advice,Shocked i‚Äôm single,"Shocked that I am single

So basically me and my friend Leigh were talking and I was giving advise, and he replied with ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre boyfriend is a really lucky guy‚Äù and I proceeded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a boyfriend lol‚Äù and he was really shocked and not just shocked for flattery but like couldn‚Äôt believe it right and I asked why it was so shocking and he basically told me to guess and so i did, i gave 4 different reasons and he says if I piece the first three together, I would have my answer but now I am really confused cause I don‚Äôt wanna say something that‚Äôs gonna sound self-involved you know... also I‚Äôm female btw

So here‚Äôs the 3 things I told him (this also came w the help of reddit) :

1) I‚Äôm probably like an easy person to talk to, and according to you more than pretty, I distance myself from others giving the idea that I am taken as I do not constantly talk to a lot of people...

2) it‚Äôs a technique to flatter me and to find out why exactly I‚Äôm single, to see if there is anything wrong w me because it just seems to unreal for me to be single lol

3) it can also be because girls are often more into getting boyfriends and are constantly sad if they don‚Äôt have a boyfriend and it‚Äôs just socially expected for a girl who doesn‚Äôt necessarily wh**e around to have a boyfriend 

So ye , little help please"

If things go well, should I ask her to see a movie that she wants to see that night?

dating_advice,Going out to dinner with his family,I've been dating this guy for around 8 months and his family likes me only a little bit.

dating_advice,Can I (22F) ask my date (22M) to hold hands without sounding childish?,"So I‚Äôve been inspired to finally post here and see what you folks think.  The guy I‚Äôm going out with on Saturday is a really nice guy, and we‚Äôve worked together since last June around my birthday.  He‚Äôs the sweetest, funniest man, we hug each time we see each other and part ways, and I‚Äôve invited him to hang out with me after work several times to major fun and success.  We had a big work conference over the weekend and I (who hasn‚Äôt really dated seriously in close to two years now) asked him if our next planned outing was a date.  He said he hadn‚Äôt been thinking of it that way‚Äîbut after a while I asked him if he WOULD let me take him on a date, to which he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why not!‚Äù  Yay!!  I told him that I really like him and he said he thinks I‚Äôm a good person, which is some awkward phrasing out of context but was really sweet in the moment.  He also ‚Äúwarned‚Äù me he hasn‚Äôt been on a date in a while, to which I said I wasn‚Äôt at all worried about that.  It was really cute.

So, the actual date.  Saturday, museum trip (I have free tickets).  We had it planned before I asked this, and I wasn‚Äôt going to call it a date‚Äîbut we were texting about unrelated things and he mentioned how he was going car hunting ‚Äúafter our date,‚Äù which is very exciting for me!  So he‚Äôs got the expectation that it‚Äôs a date, which is a plus.  This crush I developed for him over the course of 8-ish months is just so warming in my chest that I just fantasize about holding hands with him, or giving him kisses or just getting to cozy up on the couch to watch a movie.  Kind of a sappy romantic thing, I know.  So when he said our outing is a date, I just got the overwhelming hope in my heart to hold hands with him.

Is this something I can ask him when we‚Äôre out together?  Should I just try to hold his hand without saying anything?  Museums are nice sort of ‚Äústrolling around‚Äù places so it‚Äôs probably not the strangest thing, I just really want to have things work with him and don‚Äôt want to be seen as immature or weird."
dating_advice,How can I [22M] stop being constantly anxious while waiting for the opportunity to ask out this girl [24F],"Am going to ask out girl for coffee however I haven't had the chance and feel like it may be another week or more before I get the chance. 

We work in same office but not together so whenever I've talked to her, it's been at each other's desks with others around. 

I was going to wait to the end of the day and otw out when 90% of the office is empty, ask her. But I also have to do it when her co-worker isn't at her desk since they sit side by side basically.

Yesterday she left early. Today I'm not in office. Tomorrow she isn't. Day after I may not get a chance when her co-worker leaves for a second. 

- 

TLDR: so I may just have to wait a week or so. But it's like my brain can't take that, because last Monday I said ""I'm going to do it"" and once I decided, my brain instantly became anxious and want to just get it over with whether she says yes or no, just get it over with.... I guess partly because in the past I've done the ""nah I'mma wait to the perfect moment"" and then I wait to long and they aren't single anymore. Other half is that in anxious to actually do it I guess....

I can't focus on work, my appetite is gone, like my brain is so preoccupied with releasing anxiety for no damn reason

So how do I get my brain to just relax and forget about it until 4:23pm every day when I'm about to head out. I look and see ""perfect now I have the opportunity"""

dating_advice,Key differences between lust and love,"Hey all, just need some quick clarification. How would you determine if someone is in lust or in love? If not in love, a strong emotional connection to the s/o. 

To me, lust seems to be a strong sexual connection where you‚Äôre primarily focused on sex/sexual activities. Where as love seems to be a strong emotional connection where sex is integrated into the relationship but it isn‚Äôt your #1 focus. Just asking because I don‚Äôt feel any kind of lust towards my partner. I‚Äôm sexually attracted, but I‚Äôm more focused on having a future with this individual. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in love, rather I really like my partner. 

Any feedback will be appreciated, thanks!"
dating_advice,What is love?,"There‚Äôs seems to be a very delicate balance beam I walk while dating. Show too much interest, she loses interest . Play it cool and not show too much interest, the relationship seems to be budding but then slowly dies off and we lose contact.

Is this nature‚Äôs sick joke on me? I don‚Äôt quite get it.

I‚Äôm 28m, playing it back in my head I see a bunch of amazing ‚Äúcould-have-been‚Äù relationships that never played out mostly because I didn‚Äôt initiate. But then I think of the times I did initiate and got rejected.

I don‚Äôt wanna have to tell them I‚Äôm going on a date or to someone‚Äôs house or anything really, because I KNOW for sure they‚Äôll say no.

dating_advice,It's turn off if a guy calls me CUTE,"I (F22) know I come off as cute, but I never like it because I think that's everything a guy or a stranger sees in me. I've been on dates and they told me that I'm so cute and I suppose that they wasn't expecting me to get angry and have my own opinions on something.  I also had not so good experiences with guy think they can take advantage of me because I look cute, so if a guy tells me the thing that most girls would be okay with, then it's a big NO for me.

I never consider myself as a cute girl, though my friend said it. Now I'm accepting the fact that it's a part of me, but I was wondering if there's any way to not let people have that impression on me? I'm not dumb or smile at everything they say, maybe just my face and some of my stupid reactions and gesture but somehow all they see in me is a just cute, nice girl, which is fine, but I never want a guy likes me because of that. People have more than one side to be looked at.  Besides, I think I won't date guys who say I'm cute anymore though it's not their fault."
dating_advice,He asked me on a second date but hasn't planned it yet. Should I make a move??,"Last Friday I went on an impromptu date with a guy I met on Tinder.

He said I was adorable, beautiful, cuter than my profile, kissed me (multiple times) and said that he wanted to take me out on a ""real date"". 

We've been texting since then, although not quite as much and it seems like I'm the one to text first most of the time. However he's still super flirty and sweet, saying I'm cute and calling me pet names.

No mention of going out on another date yet. I'm someone who likes to plan things in advance and I get the impression that he's pretty spontaneous and not good at planning. So should I ask him about going on another date?? I really want to see him again!"

dating_advice,I (24F) can‚Äôt tell how my crush (24M) really feels about me,"This is gonna be long so I can give as much detail as possible!!!

So I (24F) recently reconnected with my hs crush (24M) and I‚Äôve been getting tons of mixed signals and wanted to get an outside perspective on it.

One night out with friends, he was on my mind for some reason and I was talking about him. My friends convinced me to hit him up and, since I was buzzed enough, I did! We chatted a lot back and forth just kinda catching up and then I confessed that I had a crush on him in high school and still kinda did so he asked me on a date!

We planned the date for the following week but then something with school came up for him so we had to push it back. We still texted every day and flirted and just had great chemistry, imo. When we finally went out, we had a really great time. We got lunch and walked around a bit for about 3-4 hours. As soon as I left, he immediately texted me saying how he had a great time and asked me on a second date!

Now, I can‚Äôt remember at what point he told me this but he said he wasn‚Äôt really looking for a serious relation because of school being his main focus at the moment since he‚Äôs struggling and in the home stretch. I told him I understood and respected it, but some part of my dumb brain said ‚Äúyou can change his mind‚Äù which was really stupid of me looking back now.

We still texted all the time and flirted and sexted a little and everything seemed to be going really well! Then he failed a test and said that he really needed to focus on school but we could still be friends. I agreed but was upset about it. He still was very flirty with me, even though HE was the one who wanted to keep it platonic, and I called him out on it. He apologized and said he‚Äôd stop. Spoiler alert: he didn‚Äôt. I called him out again saying how he was the one who made the rule so if he wanted me to flirt back, he‚Äôd have to say so. And he did so we went back to how things were.

Fast forward a bit and it‚Äôs been 2-3 months since we started talking. We finally went on a second date to the movies and he sat very close and kept brushing up against my arm, but didn‚Äôt make a move. The following day I asked him why and what we were and he reminded me that he said he didn‚Äôt want a serious relationship so he assumed we were just casual. That hurt real bad cause it felt like we were more than just casual to me. I decided I needed some time to figure out my feelings and he said he was sorry and to take all the time I needed.

I decided I still wanted to be friends with him because I genuinely enjoy his company, but that I didn‚Äôt think we should talk every day like we had been. He said okay and that he was happy we could still be friends.

Flash forward to now and we‚Äôve been chatting again and joking around and just enjoying each other‚Äôs company. I know I still have feelings for him and probably will for a long time (especially since I already have for almost 10 years) and I told him this. He said he understood and that it was fine. He‚Äôs still been kinda flirty and seems to never want to let the conversation die and keeps saying things that make me feel like he might have feelings for me, but I honestly can‚Äôt tell at this point. This whole time he‚Äôs been very open and honest about where he‚Äôs at and what‚Äôs on his mind, but maybe he doesn‚Äôt want to admit he has feelings because he really just wants to get through school and wants time to just be single before he‚Äôs done. I know i could be reading too much into this and I‚Äôm trying to not get my hopes up, but it‚Äôs hard.

So I come to you, Reddit, and ask for your advice! Obviously you guys haven‚Äôt seen our exact conversations to understand what I mean when I say he‚Äôs been flirty or anything, but with the given information what do you guys think?

Thanks in advance! &lt;3"
dating_advice,Should I just move on,"So I met this construction worker about 4 months ago. We had 1 phone conversation that went well. Than, we text maybe twice after that for about a few weeks. Than, to no conversation at all. I stopped reaching out and we stopped talking. I moved on and about 3 months later he surprisingly texted me wanting to see me. Telling me he's been going through some things(which I believe it was another woman), and saying that his mom has been in and out the hospital. So, we ended up going out on a date. He was a gentleman, holding my hand. We had nice conversation and decided to go out again. The second time he came over and I cooked. Once again, we had nice conversation but this time we had sex. I had been celibate for two years and I messed up. I totally had too much wine and my hormones was all over the place. Afterwards, I told him that this was a mistake and that I didn't want to sleep with someone that I wasn't going to be dating. I also told him that I feel that it's best if we work on building a friendship. He agreed with also saying that he want us to work on more while we're working on our friendship. The next day I went to his house, we hooked up again. He keeps saying that he wants us to date. But, it seems like we barely talk. When I text him to check on his mom that's in the hospital he text back. But it seems like I'm the one reaching out first. I asked him did he decide to just move on from this and he said no, that he's been dealing with alot with his mom being in the hospital and that he still want this thing with us. I offered to buy his mom some flowers, he told me the gesture was nice but, it wasn't necessary.  I thought that was a rude response. I'm ready to go back into my shell before he came back in my life. I'm trying to be patient, but I was okay with being by myself for the last two years. My friends told me to move on because it's still so early. I think he's still dealing with someone else. I know his mom is in the hospital, but, would that  be a reason to not contact me. I think he's stringing me along for the backup. What should I do? Thank you for the advice in advance. Sorry for the long textüòä"

dating_advice,Isn‚Äôt it kinda scummy to start a new hobby just to meet women?,"So when I ask people how to find people to date as an introvert who really doesn‚Äôt like apps, people typically recommend I join a hobby and go to meetups for it etc etc. Problem is I already have hobbies that fully satisfy me, that I attend things for.....they are just male dominated. Prospects  for meeting women there are low. So if I was to take this advice I‚Äôd have to be starting up a new hobby, not because I‚Äôm not satisfied with my current hobbies or really interested  in something new , but for the explicit purpose of meeting women. Isn‚Äôt that kind of disingenuous and scummy?"
dating_advice,I asked my (27M) partner (25F) a question during sex and now i have mixed feelings *LongStory,"This is my first time posting on reddit so im a little nervous and scatter brained but really need some help so I'll do my best to tell my story and give the important details but not ramble on.

So I've (27M) been dating my Gf (25) for a few months now, we have amazing sex regularly and really no issues in the bedroom but recently I've said some things during sex i can tell bother her and don't know what i should do.

She isn't as sexually experienced as i me so i enjoy showing her new things and discussing our past experience post sex. During a conversation the topic of open relationships and swinging came up.  I told her about my past experiences of both FMF, MFM threesomes and a gangbang i participated in. At first she was upset but understood it was the past and accepted it but did not want to hear details as it probably hurt her feelings. She expressed that she had thought about those things when she was younger and not as emotionally invested in the person she was dating at the time but would never do any of those things with me and wanted to remain monogamous which i said i agreed.

Here is where things start to get tricky. I have a huge kink for double penetration... Its my preferred genre of porn and often while im on here i love to read stories from a woman's perspective of their experiences and how much they loved it (especially during gangbangs).  So lately I've been double penetrating her with my fingers and during sex and shes agreed that it would be fun to try using toys as well. As for her she loves to give me head and loves to suck my fingers during sex.

 Well one night as shes sucking on my finger i asked if she likes sucking and fucking at the same time and she said yes, then i asked if sucking on a dildo would turn her on more and she said yes. I finally ask her what i had been wanting to ask if she wanted to suck another mans penis while i fucked her or suck us both off at once. She immediately said no, we continued until i came and later she asked if i was serious and seemed upset about it. I told her i only asked because i felt maybe she would admit she wanted to while turned on if she didn't feel comfortable telling me the first time we discussed it. I also explained that i felt fantasies are not the same as true desires and if she had fantasies like that (like mine) we could role play, watch porn or even read about it on reddit together. She said she appreciated how well we can talk about sex but was worried it was I who secretly desired those things.

We've continued to have amazing sex as usual and have not brought the topic back up but i still feel some type of way about a few things. After deep thought i agree we should stay monogamous but feel slightly confused now about what turns me on besides my sex with her. Should i have this guilty feeling about watching mfm, dp and gangbang porn and reading about it on here when i know i don't want to actually do those things? Should i accept what turns me on and inform her im still going to view such things? Is it possible i change what turns me on for the sake of having a healthy relationship. Finally is their a chance she really is into it too but doesn't want to tell me or am i just wishful thinking?

I would really love some feed back!!!

TLDR: i asked my gf about things i fantasize about, got a negative response and now im confused if i should still feel this way."
dating_advice,"How do I go about seeking a reconnection with my ex, while remaining respectful?","So long story short, my ex (26M) and I (24F) recently broke up. We were together for 3 years, somewhat long distance. We randomly met online years ago, and very quickly connected. We loved each other deeply, and had an amazing bond. We spoke every single day and were incredibly intertwined. We share almost every interest, have all the same goals, want all the same things. I know we both love each other, and that we believed in and were committed to a future together. 

Things got hard for a few months. The break up was not mutual. He broke up with me and I fought it, hard. We didn't break up over any incompatibilities, infidelity, abuse, etc. What eventually led to our break up was our communication going down the drain and my recurring battle with depression, which ended up causing me to basically neglect him. He told me he was just done and tired of my sluggish ways, that he gave me many chances and I took him for granted. He is absolutely correct. The distance obviously was a hindrance as well.

So, I will be moving away for probably up to a year to stay with family, to work on myself for the better. He knows this. I will be returning here. And I told him when I'm back, I will contact him to at least meet up. He didn't fight this idea. But he didn't indicate whether he would be open to trying again.. which is understandable, I don't expect that out him at this time.

It took us 4 days to get through the break up process. and although I didn't want it to end, our final conversation ended on an respectful, understanding note. There were moments of hope and moments of hurt. It has been about a week since we last spoke. We agreed to talk again sometime soon. But I told him to contact me first.

The problem is, after sitting on everything for a few days, I was thinking about reaching out one more time. I wrote up a very emotional letter, and I feel the absolute need for him to have. And since we were unable to do any of the break up talks in person due to distance, I thinking of asking him to meet up with me before I leave, so I can give it to him and talk one last time. If he was unwilling to, I was going to ask if I had his permission to mail it. (he doesn't live alone so I don't want to mail anything without him knowing). But I fear driving him away even harder through not respecting his space. I also fear that it will come across as begging and demanding him back, when really it's just that I still have a lot I wish to say.

My ultimate hope for this relationship is that after some time apart and growth on both sides, we can reconnect and try again. So, would reaching out again before I leave be out of line? How do I find a balance between being honest with my feelings and respecting his space?"

dating_advice,Was I taken for a ride here? Need advice,"Was I taken for a ride? Or am I over thinking

Hey guys. So I met this girl at work a few months back, we instantly hit it off and we‚Äôre always flirting and joking around etc a few months go by and she asks to go for drinks and hang out etc and eventually she stays over at my place and we hook up after a night out. It goes on casually like this for a few weeks with us spending more and more time together. 

She‚Äôs calling and texting me pretty much every day and at the weekends and we see each other multiple times a week and continue to hookup

She even came over in the eve on Xmas day  to hang out after seeing her family 

Around the Christmas period I help her move a bunch of times as her family moved states just after NYE and even helped her get her cat back from her abusive ex housemate who (for some reason) she trusted to look after her cat for one day and then refused to give it back after a week or so. She says she‚Äôs really grateful for me helping her and it means a lot. So she finally finds a place, I take a day off work to help her move and drive the truck etc and she‚Äôs finally settled in. She then invites me over a couple days later, nothing unusual and while we‚Äôre hanging out she says that she doesn‚Äôt want this to go anywhere and we should just ‚Äúchill‚Äù and stop having sex etc. 
I‚Äôm obviously a bit shocked as we‚Äôve been so close. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure she has hooked up with other people while we were doing our thing, which is fine because we didn‚Äôt talk about exclusivity or anything.

So, my question is... have I been taken for a ride here? Have I essentially been a temporary boyfriend for this girl and now she‚Äôs decided I‚Äôm no use to her anymore? We‚Äôve talked about it and she said ‚Äúwe just fucked‚Äù and there were no feelings there at all (I‚Äôll admit I was starting to like her that way). But she was adamant she wasn‚Äôt using me. 

I just find it hard to get my head around as we were very ‚Äúcouply‚Äùfor a while. 

I feel pretty used and I‚Äôm struggling to get over it and not be a resentful dick about the situation.  Also makes it kinda difficult as we work together. 

Am I being irrational?"
dating_advice,How to deal with romantic loneliness?,"I have a great family, a great job, great friends, good hobbies (acroyoga, photography, poetry, gym, hanging with friends, clean-ups). i read, i watch videos about growth, i self-analyze. i‚Äôll be going to costa rica in two weeks. i have a plan for this year: to become a licensed mental health counselor and to move out with a roommate.

yet, despite all that, I feel an overwhelming amount of romantic loneliness. I use hinge primarily for dates and I get a good amount of matches every week. I know it‚Äôs a numbers game but it still hurts after each failure.

I had matched with a cool looking girl last week and we planned to go out this past sunday but she had to hang out with friends and we couldn‚Äôt. so we rescheduled for this upcoming saturday. i texted her yesterday to confirm and she said she now has to work this weekend so we can‚Äôt hang. I work weekdays 2pm-10pm so we can‚Äôt hang out weekday evenings either.

I was really disappointed because I know the interest is gonna dwindle away since the more time we don‚Äôt actually meet, the more the interest fades away. so most likely, we won‚Äôt meet up.

And it bothers me that i‚Äôm so disappointed even though I know it‚Äôs just life and these things happen and we can‚Äôt do anything about it. I had just been kinda excited because she seemed like someone i could really connect with. It seems like I can‚Äôt even get excited about potential dates anymore because you gotta prepare for the worst so what‚Äôs the point of getting excited?

So yea, any advice on how to deal with romantic loneliness? it permeates into my life from the back of my mind."

dating_advice,How do you deal with really selfish tendencies from dating partners?,"I'm specifically asking my question about men as I'm a straight female, but I guess this could apply to any dating partner.

How do you cope with the extremely selfish tendencies that a lot of people have sometimes?

I definitely won't say all, but quite a few men seem to be extremely selfish some of the time, and get into this attitude where it seems like they can literally only focus on themselves and their own needs and their own comfort.

Like for example, over the past about 4 days I've been extremely ill and dealing with a pretty significant health issue.  For the first day or two, the guy I've been dating was checking in and seemed very concerned about it all.  Come day 3 that sort of tapered off, and when I reached out to him this morning he was very short, cold, and rude with me and in so many words basically told me he had a ""long hard day at work"" the day before and gave off the vibe that since he is now experiencing some level of discomfort, my problems no longer matter. Sigh.  

It sucks because most of the time, everything is great.  And that goes for most dating encounters I've had.  When things are going good, I have no complaints and everything is totally fun and comfortable.  But every once in a while, whether it's during a tough time or even something else, this super self absorbed attitude comes out where they only care about themselves and their own wants and needs, even if it's hurtful to the other person (me). 

Just honestly, how do you deal with it?  I feel like it can be really difficult because by nature a lot of us are more nurturing- I know for myself, even if I've had a ""long hard day at work"", if my SO is in need I don't take it out on them and will still try to help out- or at least show some type of compassion.  So when some people get stuck in this little selfish bubble, and acting like big selfish babies, it can be very hurtful.  So what do we do?  Cut them off?  Ignore them until they come around?  Seek support elsewhere from friends/family?  I feel like I don't want to cut off the entire relationship, because everything else is great.  But these times are really difficult to deal with."

dating_advice,"How do I know if I'm on a date, or just hanging out?","It seems obvious, and I admit I'm being intentionally obtuse here, because I have been wrong in the past, but is there an easy way to know if ""hanging out"" is actually intended more as a date?

The backstory here will make me sound really stupid, but here it goes:

I recently ran into a girl I was friends with in school. At the time, I had a long term girlfriend, and me and Girl (not girlfriend) would hang out in our music electives, and sometimes have lunch together as friends. It was nice times, and we shared a common passion for music. I admired her talent, and she was always very supportive of me, but it always stayed 100% platonic.

4 years later, after not seeing her, and he living, I believe in another country, she emails me out of nowhere. ""I miss seeing you. I miss talking to you. I've always had a huge crush on you"". 

By this point, I'm in a new, long term relationship, so I politely let her down easy, and tell her that her friendship is something I cherish, but we shouldn't speak any further about her feelings for me, or else stuff might get weird between us. It's amicable, and we talk about movies or whatever.

Two years still go by, and she makes a visit to me town. By now I'm completely single, and when I see her, I honestly get butterflies in my stomach. She has become an incredibly beautiful and talented woman, and I honestly feel a mild regret we never dated. I ask her to hang out, though, and she basically says she doesn't have any interest. She even goes so far as to tell mutual friends that she doesn't want to see me at all, even at social gatherings. I'm not sure why, but she just straight up isn't interested in even seeing me.


Then five more years go by. I haven't spoken to her since I last saw her at a concert festival we both played. She was polite, but distant. Then, after all that time, I'm fresh out of a recent break up, and to cheer myself up, I go to an open mic. Upon entering, I hear this beautiful singing, and I actually smile, just spontaneously at the niceness of the sound. I walk to stage area, and the singer is finishing up. She steps off stage, and says 

""Trustworthy_Expert? I didn't expect to see you here!""
 
It's her. And she's happy to see me. She compliments me, and can't wait to see me play. We spoke shortly, and it was nice. We said out goodbyes, and I figured it was a good bookend on us knowing each other.

Two days later, she sends me an email, ""hey, I liked what you did at open mic, and I'd really like to discuss playing music with you. Here's my number ###-####, we should meet and talk over some coffee""


---------------------------

Everyone I've told this to has had a different interpretation. Some say she wants to move past our strange history via the olive branch of a shared interest. Some say she legitimately wants to make the type of music I like, and is interested in collaboration. Some say she is one nanometer away from jumping my bones in a public caf√©. I honestly have no idea.

TL;DR: a girl I have a complicated history with wants to meet for coffee, and discuss our shared interest. Is there an easy way to know if it's supposed to be a date?"
dating_advice,If you‚Äôre dating multiple people do you tell those you‚Äôre dating or just leave it alone?,"I‚Äôve always wondered this. I also don‚Äôt know how to tell a guy ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm actively dating 2 other men &amp; talking to 3 others‚Äù without sounding like I‚Äôm playing some sort of game to make him jealous so he‚Äôll make a move or leave. It seems like once men take me out after the second time they pretty well assume they‚Äôre the only guy in my life expecting girlfriend treatment while making sure they never bring up exclusive talk between us. Then when I have been questioned anything about other guys it‚Äôs usually why am I busy Tuesday evening then they want to tuck in as if I‚Äôm *ruining us* when they have never made it any *us.* But most guys never say anything just assuming I‚Äôm some woman waiting around for them with nothing to do. If I‚Äôm not exclusive &amp; actively dating I‚Äôm always talking to 20 something guys, which 5 of those are going to actually ask, which leads to 3 that will actually show up making a date happen. But it‚Äôs like when a genuinely sweet guy is starring into my eyes adoring me over dinner he‚Äôs all prominent about paying for to treat me, am I supposed to tell him how I‚Äôm also doing this with someone else next weekend who also isn‚Äôt making any real commitments? If so how do you bring it up? If not, what do I say when they ask why I‚Äôm busy on another date night?

For context guys usually understand I‚Äôm not the girl dissecting out a husband on the first date I‚Äôm clear on that. I like things to fall into place &amp; actively seeking a husband like my sisters do weirds me out. I try to always be a good person &amp; lying isn‚Äôt my thing I‚Äôm not even good at it, I‚Äôm not playing games with anyone &amp; I would want someone to tell me they were dating other people....and sure I probably wouldn‚Äôt be as interested in them anymore &amp; I‚Äôd divert my attention to other guys. But it seems like it‚Äôs different with guys &amp; idk if it‚Äôs better to tell them or stay quiet about what never gets brought up. Or how to lie about being busy if I should lie about it."
dating_advice,Is it possible that a rebound might push me back to my ex for all the wrong reasons?,"So I just broke up with my girlfriend of one year. We had a very turbulent relationship. We went on quite a few breaks, broke up and got back together once before. I ended it a few weeks ago for the second time.

There‚Äôs this other girl I‚Äôve known for quite a while and we‚Äôve always had a thing for each other. We have been hanging out a bit and getting a little bit close. But I need some advice.

Is it possible that getting close to someone too quickly could make me run back to my ex for the wrong reasons? I still love her and obviously I‚Äôm not over her, but clearly we don‚Äôt work together. We‚Äôve broken up twice in our first year of dating. I‚Äôm scared that if I start spending time with someone else while I‚Äôm still not over her, that it could push me back to her. You know, where you get blinded by feelings of regret and sadness, missing the familiarity, comparing everyone to them. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll start remembering all the good things and forget all the bad things and why we broke up in the first place.

dating_advice,Can I still ask her out?,"Freshman year at university, girls are rare in our programme. There's this one girl who is in a completely different social circle, but she always showed interest and tried to give eye contact. Until recently. I had a girlfriend and it was a whole mess, so I didn't want to get too close to her and ruin any chances. We met once very briefly but never hung out together with the same group, so no chance to flirt or get to know each other.

Now I'm considering going for her, but I notice there's another guy she recently met who she seems interested in. Flirty and all that.

I'd like to give it a shot before it's too late and she finds someone, but I don't want to seem desperate.

I think she either found out I wasn't available and lost interest, or I'm afraid I might have appeared like a creep by not doing anything for a while.

dating_advice,How should I [24M] ask her [21F] out without making it awkward?,"I'm doing a master's degree at this university. A month ago I went to one of the uni cafes to ask for a job, and they told me to come when the manager is there. So I went a bunch of times asking for him when he wasn't there, as well as genuinely getting coffee, so some of the staff (which is comprised of students) started recognizing me. In particular a couple of girls I talked to the most. 

One of them, even from day one, caught me eye as very sweet and beautiful. I went last week after winter break, and she was behind the counter and asked me if I was the guy looking for a job, and I said that the manager had told me to wait till the end of the month and then come back. We also got to talking a little bit, but she was in the middle of work and I was with a friend so that was it.

I want to maybe ask her out, but I'm still not sure if I'll start working there at some point. If I do, maybe it makes sense to get to know her from work first, see if she likes me a bit, and then ask her out. Otherwise, I might do it casually next time we chat, but she can reject me and it would be awkward if I do end up working there. Or even if I don't.

I have to say I'm generally very impatient, and I've figured out it's usually hurt me in the dating game. I want to go up there and be like ""I think you're cute blah blah"", but I feel like I'm messing it up."

dating_advice,Undercover date confirmation tactic to avoid getting stood up (ghosting),"Use this little trick to avoid getting stood up / ghosted on  a date. Tested it many times - never failed.

1-2 days before the date is planned, send a text message  where you slightly change the time of the date - without sounding like you will be rushed or have to leave early.

Example of such a text message:

""Hey, so on Saturday do you mind meeting 15 minutes earlier? If not, it's no big deal as I have all evening :-)""

This subtly let's the other person know that you intend on coming, so they won't be scared that you will ghost. It also checks if they are coming, because if they are, they will reply to you. If they don't reply, you know they will definitely not show up so you can plan something else.

It's like an undercover confirmation because you find out if they're still coming without sounding needy.

Best of luck. Hope it will help others as well :-)"

dating_advice,Feelings for a flatmate,"So I [M20] am at uni living in a flat of 6 since September. One of my flatmates [F22] is this attractive girl with the kind of personality that I love. I would tell her but I dont want to make things awkward for the rest of the year since we and 2 other flatmates hang out most of the time. 

We're friendly with each other and have had a few good conversations just between us but that's what happens when you're friends with someone not necessarily a sign of interest.

Should I wait till the end of the year when I move out or risk it now?

Tl;dr: I dont want to make our friendship awkward but I like her"
dating_advice,Should I Ask Someone at a Caf√© Out?,"I (18M) come to this one caf√© very often because I enjoy studying outside my house and also I find I'm better able to focus in environments that aren't devoid of noise, kinda like inverse ADD.

Anyways, someone (probably somewhere between 17-20, assuming female) came in today and while I usually don't really notice a lot of people on account of being asexual, I immediately noticed her/them.

I was very strongly attracted and immediately wanted to talk to them. They were alone so it probably wouldn't have been that difficult.

Should I make a move? I've never even tried to have a conversation with a complete stranger before, and am also highly introverted, but from their mannerisms, they also seemed shy and introverted.

Since I've already probably missed my chance by the time anyone responds, what about next time?
If I ever see anyone in a similar situation again, should I consider asking them out?

If yes, then do you have any tips or advice on what I should say/do?

Thanks!"

dating_advice,"How to keep a conversation alive between you set a date, and when it actually happens?","So I've been talking to this girl for a few days now. At first it was really sporadic on Tinder. Then I asked her if it would be easier to use FB or text. And she agreed it would be. We've been talking straight since. I really enjoy talking to her and the conversation has gone well! So I asked her out for the weekend (both of us have commitments in the week right now or I'd have asked sooner).

We've been asking lots of the regular questions you ask when getting to know someone, with other bits popping up in between.

How can I keep the conversation going until the date without feeling like I've asked all the relevant questions. I'm not worried about the actual date because it's to go have a drink and play some pool, so it'll be an activity rather than sitting in a cafe or something."

Of course there is some girls I enjoy talking to but not many make me think ""wow"" you're so interesting. Any advice in meeting girls that have personalities? Or am I just the immature one ? I am 19 and hook up with chicks at parties a bit, but never anything further."
dating_advice,Hot and Cold ü•µü•∂,"Hey guys! I need some advice!

I‚Äôm a guy and there‚Äôs this girl I used to work with a few months back. We started sleeping together after a few weeks of flirting in the workplace and drinks after work together, and then when we were on a night out, she asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with her and I said yes. I thought it was a bit quick, but I liked her and I felt ready. But after a week, she said she didn‚Äôt feel like it was going anywhere and broke it off with me. 

In the time between that break up and now, she dated someone else for a few weeks who had kids, but they broke up when she found out he didn‚Äôt want to have any more kids.

One of her big aims in life is to get married and have kids.

We started hanging out again as we still worked quite close together and we carpooled etc and had a mutual friend, after a few weeks of being friends, she came out for a night out on my birthday and we ended up sleeping together again. After that we‚Äôve slept together a few times and haven‚Äôt really spoken about it. She then stayed a few times and didn‚Äôt want to have sex, but really wanted to cuddle and sleep spooning, but I thought things were cooling off and was ready to let go.

Then she pulled a 180 and bought VIP tickets for me and her to go and see her favourite band and one of my favourite bands MCR in a gig that sold out in minutes. The gig is in 5 months and we‚Äôve only known eachother for around 3, but we agreed, as she got the tickets that I book a hotel and after party tickets, which I did, still a little cautious about what sort of position we‚Äôre going to be in in 5 months time.

We‚Äôre going for a day out shopping trip in another city i tomorrow - which was her idea, but we also spent the night together again last night. However, when things started to heat up, she put a blocker on it and said she wasn‚Äôt feeling it. Which I 100% agree you don‚Äôt need a reason to refuse sex and wouldn‚Äôt ever try and demand an explanation or anything like that. But I felt like there was something she was thinking about that was holding her back from expressing herself that she wasn‚Äôt telling me. I tried to initiate a conversation, not just about that, but where she saw us in 5 months time and she just kept brushing me off and saying ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô.

I‚Äôm really confused and not sure if we just had a little spark of passion that‚Äôs cooling off, or if she wants to date me in the long term.

We spoke a bit drunkenly before we hooked up on my birthday and she said the reason she broke it off with me initially was because she is an idiot and felt like it was too real and that she didn‚Äôt deserve it.

A few factors though. She‚Äôs 23 and I‚Äôm 32 - we both live with our parents - and have both only just moved back to our hometown - her because of a failed relationship - and me because my career didn‚Äôt work out and I had quite bad depression from living in a bigger city.

I feel like we found eachother in a star crossed moment when we were in a similar point in our lives. But I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs fully over the relationship and I‚Äôm still in a process of trying to start a new career. 

And finally, she told me the other day she‚Äôs still wearing a promise ring her ex gave her - until she sells it and buys a new one. But doesn‚Äôt want to take it off in between. Which I feel like might be a metaphor for how she views relationships. But who knows? 

I like her a lot and I do want a relationship with her, but I‚Äôve also got my guard up - and don‚Äôt want to risk investing in someone doesn‚Äôt seem to know what she wants - or isn‚Äôt very good at communicating what she wants. I also don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs just sex - as we‚Äôve obviously got good chemistry, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt her or be hurt myself. 

Anyway feel like I‚Äôve rattled on for ages! üòÖ

Thank you if you‚Äôve read all this.

Any advice?"
dating_advice,"A girl had a crush on me while I had a girlfriend, but now that I'm available and want to give her a chance, she might be interested in someone else. How do I still approach but avoid seeming desperate?","Freshman year at university, girls are rare in our programme. There's this one girl who is in a completely different social circle, but she always showed interest and tried to give eye contact. I had a girlfriend and it was a whole mess, so I didn't want to get too close to her and ruin any chances. We met once very briefly but never hung out together with the same group, so no chance to flirt or get to know each other.

Now I'm considering going for her, but I notice there's another guy she recently met who she seems interested in.

I'd like to give it a shot before it's too late and she finds someone, but I don't want to seem desperate.

Girls here, what would you think if your previous crush asked you out?"
dating_advice,Re: I got his number (and how kindness won the day).,"So I wanted to do a followup to a recent post of mine from about two weeks ago. In the post, I mentioned how I met a very charming man at a men's clothing store. I was looking for a birthday gift for my brother and he was incredibly sweet and helpful. I felt like he was flirting with me, but was admittedly hard to tell since it was his job to sell me things. I came here asking for some advice (as I wasn't sure when I'd see him again). But the advice received was that I should move on.  


It's been two weeks and I went back into the mall for the first time in a while... I had no need to return to his store specifically and I had no idea if he'd even be there. But I was curious! Part of me wanted to go in there and say hi. But ultimately I decided against it. I ended up going into Target to get a small desk lamp for my new room and picked up a few other things...And once I reached the checkout I noticed there was a bit of a queue, but it wasn't really moving... I noticed that the elderly lady in front of me had purchased a wall mirror but her card wasn't processing and she looked extremely embarrassed. So I just kind of blurted out happily offering to pay for it. She kept declining but I asked her to just pay it forward to someone else in need one day. As we got through the checkout I realised she wasn't going to get this thing out by herself so I offered to wheel her things to her car and we got to chatting. At this point, we were wheeling the stuff past my crush's store and I see him staring straight at us looking astonished before smiling and coming out towards us. *''What are you two doing?''* he said mischievously. And the lady I was with instantly recognised him calling him Cody and explained how I had helped her purchase the mirror because her card wasn't working and we were just heading out to her car. He then looks to me with a smirk and introduces me to her formally. It was his grandmother!! And she laughed and asked why he didn't tell her about me sooner. It was so surreal. And then as we were about to go back out to her car he handed me one of his store's loyalty cards with his number jotted down. Everything is such a blur but I just remember blushing a lot and I mumbled that I'd give him a call later. And now we have a date planned for Saturday!! \~\~Dances\~\~

&amp;#x200B;

I am just so overjoyed right now.   


But it's in times like these that I wanted to stress and remind people of the importance and the power of kindness and understanding. It is probably the single most important thing I could recommend to anyone here. And so it saddens me to see so much hatred in this community right now. There is a post in particular that I read earlier... In which a guy attempts to lend his perspective. At one point in the post, he refers to his own attractiveness. And people have just lost their minds over the audacity. But it's manifested into something so horrible. In the comments, there are plenty of people bullying and berating the poster. I think people forget how many of them are going up against one single poster. And it's just so heartbreaking to see.   


Please be kind guys!!! And try to understand people instead of dismissing them because you don't understand them."
dating_advice,How to decline first date invitation upon 2 days of chatting?,"Hello,

22 M here desperatly bad at dating/standing up for my own thoughts and decisions and I've again encountered a situation that I've been in handful of times. Please help haha

Unknown girl sent me a message on Facebook. We started slowly chatting, but judging from her writing style and stuff, her pictures, she's not appealing to me at all... I'm dreading the moment she proposes a meetup as she's living in our small town. I literally don't know what's the best way to turn down a date after only chatting with each other for a few days - afraid I'd look like a douchebag. I feel like the path of the least resistance is to go somewhere and then just tell her I didn't feel connection? But at the same time I'm angry at myself that I can't ""stand up"" for my opinion and I'd just go there waste my and her time which I don't want to do either.

I'm just so lost, I don't know if it's reasonable to turn down someone if I haven't even seen them yet in person. But honestly I know there's absolutely nothing between us, not even slight bit of chemistry and look-wise she's just not my type at all. It doesn't help that she seems very nice from the chatting, maybe even too nice haha.

What would you do? Thank you."
dating_advice,Why does he keep accusing me of things I'm not doing,"We've been together somewhere around ten months. I'm crazy in love with him and we have a relationship that is happy and full of love, except for one thing that keeps happening.

It will be about every two months or so, all of a sudden he will become distant, when I ask what's going on he will accuse me of doing some crazy shit that I'm not doing.

Latest example; Sunday night, according to him I got up during the night (which I have no recollection of at all) and he claims I'm secretly texting other guys in the living room while he's sleeping. I never have and never will do this, but then this starts a whole ball rolling of other crap he says I did. He starts questioning me about a text I supposedly received (didn't receive any) and no matter what answer I give, he doesn't believe it. This fight he started on Monday morning. We tried talking about it last night and he still doesn't believe me, we are still fighting. 

This isn't the first time this has happened and seems to be a pattern for him. I'm so tired of being happy and totally in love and then out of no where he comes at me with these accusations. I'm tired of defending myself against lies. On top of everything, it makes me feel like I myself can't trust HIM and start to wonder what shady shit HE might be doing behind my back and it just has caused this whole paranoia between us and jealousy.

I don't want to be without him, but I don't know when these accusations will stop. He apparently has been cheated on in the past, so it's possible he won't trust me ever because of that, but that isn't fair to me in my opinion.

What could be the reason he's doing this? Will he ever stop?"
dating_advice,Girl stopped replying? Why?,"

Been talking to a girl i matched w on tinder (through whatsapp) for about a month now. I asked her to meet up a few weeks back then 2 days before meet, she was stuck at work. I‚Äôm currently on a business trip til next next week so rescheduling during that time wasnt an option yet. We‚Äôve been constantly texting and all, she never left me on read nor on deliverzone until tonight. we‚Äôve been chatting then she suddenly leaves me on read for about 3hrs already. She did post on IG so i know she‚Äôs still alive. Should I double text?

Thing is: we‚Äôve been chatting constantly and have never replied later than 3hrs It was a read message so it isnt just a deliver. I‚Äôm considering 2 options if she doesnt message me in 1-2 days. NC or should I double text? To be fair, my last message was a comment not a question. However, the past month we‚Äôve been chatting, she hasN‚Äôt left me on read or anythint like that yet

If it matters I come from Asia (where people (and women) are more conservative). I did ask her out about 2 weeks after and she said yes, canceled t-2 days due to work. I wouldnt be in the country for the next few weeks and she is aware. However, she continued to chat me regularly until awhile ago. Do you think I should double text? My last message was simply a comment and not something to reply to per se"

dating_advice,"I contacted every woman I've dated of the past few years for a ""review"" of dating me.","I've been on many dates in the past few years after breaking up with an ex of 3 years. I had no problem finding long term relationships before dating my last ex, but now women all seem to only want to hookup? I've been with maybe 15+ women in the past few years and nothing has worked out.

Some of the recent reviews I've received from the women I've contacted have been across the board so I don't know what to take of them. I'm located in Vancouver, BC.

""You're really boring and I wasn't interested."" (This woman was the boring one I think, she replied with one word answers every date)

""The cultural differences were too great, and you need to learn to love yourself more. You're a great guy and you'll find a nice girl eventually."" (This woman moved from Trinidad to Vancouver and she ghosted me after a few great months of dating)

""I wasn't in the right place when we were dating and you didn't reply to my Snapchats."" (???)

""We had nothing in common and I didn't see anything long term. You're a great guy though."" (This woman had no hobbies and didn't really do anything other than work and watch TV)


I'm trying to find a serious relationship but having some serious problems finding the right women. I've dated women from my college classes, Hinge, Tinder, etc. Every woman I've dated in the past few years seems to only want sex then stops talking to me, kicking me out of their house in the morning, only inviting me to their house to hookup and not wanting to actually date. I bring up the fact that I'm looking for something serious from the first date, so my intentions are very clear.


Is dating culture ruined now? Or is it just me? I have absolutely no idea what to take of the feedback I've received since it's all over the place. I consider myself average in terms of looks, and I own my own business and have many different social hobbies, so I don't consider myself that boring."
dating_advice,"Is he playing hard to get, shy or just not interested anymore?","I (F20) met this guy (M21) on new Year's eve at a party. We danced a bit and he said he wanted to kiss me but I didn't want to because we were both a bit tipsy and didn't know each other yet. 

We did exchange our Instagram so we could keep contact. We talked a bit and right of he was talking about taking me on a date. Not much later we exchanged numbers, added each other on snap chat, he added me on Facebook and we went on a first date. 

I liked him on the first date and since he leaned over me to kiss me a few times, I had a feeling he liked me too. 

But the part that confuses me is the following. 

The positives:

- In the beginning, he was very enthusiastic to do something with me together.

- He added me on every social media which gives me the feeling he doesn't want to keep me secret.

- On the first date, he took the initiative to kiss me a few times.

- I asked him if he would be down for a second date and he said he would be.

- He almost texts me every morning a ""good morning *kiss emoji*"" and every evening a good night message. 

Now the negatives that confuse me:

- He takes outside of his work hours over 3 hours to respond to my text. (I asked him about that and he says that it is a bad habit of wanting to respond later and then forget about it.)

- I notice he doesn't take much initiative to get to know me. I always ask the questions and try my hardest to not let the conversation die (on the phone IRL he is very talkative). 

- He did take the initiative to meet each other for the first date so I found it only fair for me to ask him for the second date. He said yes but he only has free time in the evening so we always had to think about what we wanted to do. Only the last time I wanted to meet with him (on a Sunday) I asked on Saturday about the time and if he had any preference in activities (since that day was the first time we could meet in the day time.) And he never responded to it... But the next day he said sorry for it and it was because he was with his friends and overlooked the text.

- Since the above second date plan, I never hear him about it and he never asks I we could still meet up.

The thing is I have a history that I always had to do everything in a relationship and the moment I waited for a return the relationship/ conversation died off. I don't want to jump into any conclusions so that's why I wanted your guys (and girls) perspective. Because at the moment this gives me a lot of mixed feelings but mabey I overlook something."

dating_advice,Met a girl (18/19) that I‚Äôm (19M) totally crazy about and I feel completely helpless about trying to pursue her further.,"Apologies if this is long-winded, but there‚Äôs a lot I need to get off my chest. (TL;DR included)

A little under a week ago, my band played at the birthday party of one of our friends. I (19M) ended up meeting a girl (18/19) there, and long story short I‚Äôm obsessed. Besides being absolutely, insanely, fantastically gorgeous, moreso than anyone I‚Äôve ever met by far, she holds a great conversation and was a joy to be around. In order to get to know me and others she didn‚Äôt know better, she asked what our life story was. Interesting proposition, right? Eventually, my turn came and I reluctantly talked. Even though most of it was related to how fucked-up my family relationships are and how fucked-up my life is in general, she listened like it all actually mattered and held weight, which was something not even my closest friends can do without cracking some dumb joke every ten seconds. Even when everyone else around walked away upstairs, she stayed to listen to everything I said, and the gesture and the way she took me seriously touched me in a way I‚Äôve never experienced before. I now know there‚Äôs something there that my brain is screaming at me to seek further. I even sat myself down, gave myself a talk, and said I had to try to pursue her further. But, as is usually the case, there‚Äôs a few problems.

For one, I‚Äôve never been lucky in love, ever. I mean never had a girlfriend, still a virgin, never been on a date, the whole shebang. Nope, nada, nothing. I know I‚Äôm not a totally unlikeable guy, I trust my friends when they say I‚Äôm a very unique individual who deserves to be happy, I‚Äôve just been extremely unlucky I guess. And when you have borderline personality disorder like I do, you feel things more intensely than others, so the constant rejection and loneliness I‚Äôve felt all my life is crushing to say the least (hooray for mental illness!). Given all that, I have very little confidence in my ability to find love at all, and it‚Äôs extremely easy for me to get discouraged and fall into a pattern of get infatuated, lose my footing, say fuck it and give up, rinse wash repeat. And two, a close friend of mine (same age as me) told me out of the blue the following day that it‚Äôs likely that she likes him instead of me, and THAT has its own problems. A) He‚Äôs always been know for being Mr. Hot Shit with women, acting all overly macho in those situations all the time, and it‚Äôs always worked for him somehow. B) He‚Äôs know her for a bit longer than I have, and has a class in college with her, which only means more of an opportunity for him to sway her over to his side. But even then, he didn‚Äôt specify if he‚Äôs even into her, leaving me mostly in the dark and extremely worried about my time being potentially up already. C) As previously mentioned, he‚Äôs a very close friend, but he‚Äôs also in the band with me. I don‚Äôt want to put our friendship at risk if it becomes a warring love triangle situation, but I‚Äôm also not going to give up and let this girl slip away. I‚Äôve done it too many times before and it‚Äôs time I take a firm stand for myself.

My brain‚Äôs in full panic mode. Trying to tweak a ton of things about myself to make myself more attractive, trying to learn more songs to play at gatherings to impress her (yes, I‚Äôm that desperate), trying to talk differently or carry myself differently, but like I said, it‚Äôs so easy for me to give up. There‚Äôs so much going on around me besides all this that‚Äôs impacting my thinking process as well, and worrying me that I‚Äôm gonna lose out on this angel of a human being. I‚Äôd appreciate any and all tips and tricks you guys have. I‚Äôm really in need of a helping hand here.

TL; DR-Fell hard for a beautiful girl that has potentially no interest in me and might be more into a close friend, and I‚Äôm freaking out about what to do because I really feel something strangely wonderful and unique with her."
dating_advice,"Right person, wrong time.","TLDR: Commitmentphobe meets soul mate. Soul mate is in (what sounds like) an unhealthy relationship, but has never dated anyone else, and has no point of comparison. No physical cheating has occurred, nor will it, until he's single. 

*Please hear me out before you judge. Long post ahead. I feel like Adam Sandler in the Wedding Singer.

He (31M) and I (29F) kept crossing paths at industry events. Professionally, there's only a handful of people in the city/country doing what we do. (High stress, high risk) We survive by keeping in touch with each other and working through problems.

We finally setup a dinner meeting. I've never felt more connected to someone, understood, or seen by anyone in my life. Complete and mutual admiration, fascination and curiosity. Intense conversation, intoxicating glances, excitement and laughter. Perfect chemistry. As we settled up, commute came up and he told me where he lived...with his gf (*hesitantly whispered, looking guilty). Killed the vibe, so I kept my distance.

Months later, let him know I had a meeting at his office. We ended up grabbing coffee and I apologized for low key hitting on him at our dinner meeting. He admitted it was fully mutual. My new office was nearby, and told him he was always welcome to drop by. He ended up coming by later that day and we had dinner. Again, great chemistry. 

From then on, we've been texting nearly every day. It got progressively more intimate, but about 30-40% was work related. He's a good guy, and knows emotional cheating is bad, and we've agreed nothing would happen until he's single. He offered to break up with her early on, but he was super stressed at work, and I told him to sort that out first. Also, it's a big decision for him. (They've been dating for almost a decade)

Beyond our relationship, I want him to be happy. He fights with her everyday, he has (politely) alluded to her not being very sharp, and they haven't had sex in almost six months. He's had little dating experience, so he thinks it's normal to be miserable every day. He deserves to be happy, even if it's not with me. (Although, he's told me he's in love with me)

As for me, I've eluded a few proposals and given up on finding ""the one"". I even stopped dating because I didn't want to hurt anyone. I rarely chase men, or spend time obsessing over dating, but he's the only person I've ever truly considered having a life with. This isn't some fling, I'm pretty sure this is it. (As nauseating as that sounds) Yes, I should back off, but he's already unhappy and I'm pretty sure he's my husband, as batshit crazy as that sounds. 

My options are 1) Wait 2) Move on 3) Fight for him, because all's fair in love &amp; war?"

dating_advice,Did I(20M) read the situation wrong?,"Met this girl(20F) in one of my college classes that I have twice a week, had a normal convo with her when we initially met, nothing too much. Ended up running into her during a career fair and chatted for a bit and got her number.

Now, I start to text her the day after this and I get some extremely dry responses so I figure this girl isn't interested in me. Oh well. But the next day I see her in class (which she said she was originally going home after), we have a great conversation( I also noticed that she stares at me a lot) and she ended up asking me out to get food. Now, I'm not sure what this counted as (ie. a date or just friends getting food) but she ended up spending 2 hours with me instead of going home. We went to eat and had a pretty enjoyable time, lots of flirting and smiling, etc. It seemed to me that we had pretty good chemistry together.

Besides her rearranging her schedule to eat with me, she also told me that she usually makes the first move on a guy she likes which I was pretty dense at first in understanding, but later that day, guessed that that probably was referring to me. 

Next day, I planned to ask her out on the weekend (which was in 3 days) in person, but I didn't see her in person so I ended up texting her if she was busy Saturday night. She replied that she was and asked if I was too. (???) I just responded ""ah nevermind then"".

Fast forward a few days later to when we have class (bio lab) together, she is a lot colder than she was when I last spoke to her: less smiling, less staring, slightly more rude, rarely initiated conversation, etc (although she would still talk normally if I initiated).

Is this her hinting that she is not interested and that the food thing was just as friends, or maybe if she just had a bad day or something?"
dating_advice,"[M18] starting college soon, how could an ugly person like me even begin to find love?","How would I even be able to make any kind of positive first impression when I make it to college. I don‚Äôt wanna be alone forever and if I don‚Äôt get any kind of relationship experience that‚Äôs the path I‚Äôm headed, since I‚Äôm ugly I have like one standard. I don‚Äôt view every girl as a potential romantic relationship and don‚Äôt have any weird expectations in anyone I just wanna not be alone, but my fucked up face is an obstacle to me being loved, I feel anxious every Time I see it because I don‚Äôt know how anyone could love it or kiss it without regrets or disgust."
dating_advice,Girl I met on discord,"So there is this girl that I have gotten to know over a year and 2 months ago. I didn't know how she looks but I immediately fell in love with her voice. She sounded so sweet and shy, like myself. When I got to see how she looks like (because of web calls with group of online friends), she was even more beautiful than I could even imagine. We do not live in the same country (I need to catch a plane to get to her). The problem is here, I tried ""flirting"" with her (my flirting isn't the best), I got some friends to try and spoon feed her that I like her without actually telling her that I like her but to no avail. She also coached me personally when there was an Overwatch tournament for my college. Some friends say that she likes me but she is a super tough cookie to crack. I posted recently about long distance relationships and she replied saying that if you meet that someone and you wanna try long distance relationships, go for it. Here is the thing, I haven't talked to her in months and then she replied like that to a public post. 

I am not sure as to how I should read this but I don't know how. I wish I knew if she liked me or not but I am horrible in that topic. If a girl flirts with me, I just simply wouldn't know and same thing goes for this girl that I met on discord. 

Any advice?"
dating_advice,"So there‚Äôs this girl that plays bass at church and I play drums. I pick her up and give her a ride every Sunday.

dating_advice,Best approach?,So pretty much I‚Äôm 18 and male. There‚Äôs this girl in my Bio class who I‚Äôve known(not personally but we went to the same highschool) and she‚Äôs one of those girls who‚Äôs like a 10/10 to the majority of guys. I‚Äôm not that bad looking myself but I would probably give myself 9/10 the most and if it‚Äôs a good dayüòÇ. Well I‚Äôve never really talked to her at all and I wonder what would be the best way of just starting off by being her friend. I could definitely sit in her group during the days that we have a lab so that would be a good start I think. But I guess I‚Äôm wondering is how do you seem interesting(or just be friends ) to a girl who‚Äôs probably used to always getting guys attention . Thanks
dating_advice,I want some people‚Äôs advice and to possibly see if anybody has had a similar experience.,"I want some people‚Äôs opinions and similar experiences possible.

So this is my first ever Reddit post I‚Äôm hoping it gets some traction. So in early July of 2018 I was playing fortnite one night and came across this girl. I‚Äôm not one for online or long distance relationships I‚Äôm a very physical person but I couldn‚Äôt help but a feel a pull toward her. She added me and we played for a few days before exchanging instagrams and we started talking on there. We found out that we had many common interests and we just clicked right away. I was beginning to fall for her and I couldn‚Äôt stop. I was trying to hide my feelings because I knew it could never work. She was in Texas and I Wisconsin. Ironically I was born in Dallas. But she reluctantly told me that she was falling for me and couldn‚Äôt stop even tho she‚Äôd tried. We had FaceTimed a lot before this conversation. I wanted to say I love you so bad but I didn‚Äôt want to scare her off. But one night we were FaceTiming it had to of been like 6 hours by now. Around like 4amish and we were saying goodnight and she said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù it just came out by accident she blushed became a little embarrassed apologized and said it was an accident. And I told her it was fine and I loved her too. And it felt so good to say. We dated for 2 months before her mom found out she decided to tell her and yeah no we didn‚Äôt talk for a year and just came back to each other this past summer in early August. I still love her, I never stopped loving her. I tried to move on but I have never ever connected with anybody on this level before. It‚Äôs honestly scary sometimes how well we know each other. Now there is an age difference of 2 years 8 months I‚Äôm currently 19 and she 16 I have been and am going to wait for her to turn 18 before I see her. But love is love right? I hope someone has the heart to read all of this. We‚Äôve spent countless hours on FaceTime calls talked for 8+ hours just laughing sharing memories or telling stories. The bond we‚Äôve created is unbreakable and we both know that. I plan on marrying this girl someday. I‚Äôm going to see her in less than 2 years and I can‚Äôt wait. I will of waited a total of almost 4 years for her. I‚Äôve never been more attracted to someone physically, or mentally. So that‚Äôs my story, true love? What do you think 


TL:DR Met a girl on fortnite, talked for a bit and FaceTimed a lot,  fell in love with her and she me. Have to wait years to see each other  but are both willing to wait. Has been over a year and half and going so well. Will see her in 2 years."
dating_advice,How do I ask a girl out after not talking to her for 9 years after we broke up?,I broke up with a girl 9ish years ago because I didn‚Äôt like her nose. But she‚Äôs successful now and I really want to rekindle the relationship. How do I go about this?
dating_advice,Would anyone consider this an early red flag,"I, m19, met F18 on bumble. Convos went decent. Cut short because late at night and school and such. Today I asked her if she'd be interested in grabbing coffee or lunch one of these days, and she said

""Hmmm we'll see ü§∑""
"" Ooh I‚Äôve been wanting to go mini golfing at LOCATION. Even tho I suck ""

I agreeded, saying it sounds far more fun. Yadda yadda 

I admit, I didn't spent much time building up interest before asking her out, but she was gonna leave soon to sleep, and didn't wanna keep dragging the question. Convo ended with her saying. 

""I‚Äôll let you know probably tomorrow""
""Goodnight"" 
Me; no worries. Good night üò¥
Her : üòäü•∞


Idk if this is a flag. I have very little dating experience, but it seemed odd that she sorta re chose what we're gonna do, and then didn't confirm if we will be doing that. Maybe I asked her out rather quickly than she was expecting. Or should this exchange raise an eyebrow on my behalf?

Side note: this convo was on snap. Got out of bumble chat asap."
dating_advice,Should I ask him if he wants a third date or no,"So I went on two dates with this one guy. I thought everything was going ok. We held hands, kissed, he put his arm around me, etc. But after our second date he became very dull. It‚Äôs hard to even hold any conversations with this guy when we message. He gives very short responses so I became pretty dull too. Should I just ask him if he‚Äôs interested in a third date or if he wants to be friends? How do I word this without sounding clingy? Honestly I like things straightforward. I don‚Äôt like wasting time lol the chase is fun only up to a certain extent I think."
dating_advice,I (24M) am trying to hang out with a girl (21F) I've been talking to again.,"I already hung out with, I'll call her ""k"" earlier this week, we had fun, laughed a lot, played some video games, I gave her an ""oh you"" type touch on the knee when she died in the game. It was a good time and she said she wanted to do it again sometime soon.  I know she has off work today and part of me wants to be bold and say ""getting together again tonight, right?"" Or something like that, that doesn't mess around. For some background, I met K by putting my number on my receipt while she was waitressing for me at Red Robin. I gave her the message ""you're doing a good job"" and she was super appreciative of the praise and texted me as soon as her shift ended. We've been talking a little bit over day and she's opened up about herself a little. She recently got a dui for smoking and driving. I kinda went a little soft, and understanding with her, and now she doesn't ""jump"" at the chance to talk to me anymore.  I want to show her that I'm interested in her in more than just a friendly capacity and I think I need to be bolder and flirty, because I think that's what hooked her in the first place. Ideas?"
dating_advice,"Confidence grows even through rejections, and every No brings you a step closer to the proper Yes","So I (28M) two months ago got out of a 5 year relationship, it definitely was not an easy decision to make with everyone expecting us to go the extra step into marriage however it had to be done for both our sakes.

After taking some time obviously to my self I began tipping my toes back into the dating game, I knew from the get go that by now I wasn't interested in meeting someone just for sex but truly take the time to meet another girl for the purpose of establishing something serious and proper in the long run.

I used to live abroad and recently moved back to my home country, and this enabled me to meet up and reconnect again with good people that I lost touch with. So I got to know a girl I used to know only vaguely from common circles and a girl I never thought would cause me to generate an interest because we were both in different life phases, but there was something in her eyes, her cheeks and her smile which triggered an internal likeness.

So after getting to know each other a bit better and feeling more comfortable with each other I decided to ask her out. She blushed and was flattered by my initiative and confidence however in the end she had to reject the proposal because of her recently dating a guy and she just wasn't the type of girl to throw it up in the air without giving that guy a chance. But she appreciated and respected me for making a move and I know that if it wasn't for the other guy then I would have had my chance. 

But I agreed with her and appreciated her honesty and respected her decision, and made sure to let her know that there would be no awkwardness from my part because we would see each other in common circles every few days.

After the initial feeling of disappointed faded , I was really proud of my self for taking the initiative and even through this rejection my confidence has grown. If I hadn't ask her then I wouldn't have know, and I prefer to get a rejection rather than a regret. And I know that with every No the way opens up for the proper Yes."
dating_advice,Did I overreact &amp; act hastily or did I do the right thing?,"I've liked this guy since I was 17 (now 27) and we've always had a connection but were never single at the same time.

He's said things to me in past like he hasn't met any other girls like me and that I'm the one that got away. He tends to contact me when he's drunk or broken up with his on &amp; off ex. When we're together we have an amazing time.

However, early last year he got in touch again. Invited me over and said his relationship is over. We hung out, had fun. Nothing sexual happened, but he wanted something to happen and I stopped him. He said he was going to do things right with me because he respects me.

Next day I found out he's back together with his ex. Told him off and said I'm not a consolation prize for whenever he and she are having a fight. Didn't speak to him again.

Ran into him 5 months afterwards, I felt forgiving and said it's okay and that things are cool between us. He said he'd like to take me out for coffee to make up for his past behaviour and explain himself. We went out and he told me he'd been single for 7 weeks then, and admitted he used other people as a crutch instead of looking at his own relationship.

Said he'd like to mend his friendship with me and take things slow. We hung out occasionally. Messaged every day. Slept together after a few weeks on occasion. When I'd ask where things are going between us he'd say he doesn't have an answer for me, and also doesn't want me to be a rebound. He spoke a lot about the things we'd still do together in future. Coupley stuff. 

Every time something intimate would happen I would ask again, because I wanted clarity and to know what his intentions were. Every time he gave a vague answer. Even said something about being non-committal.

When hanging out with some of his other friends around he'd talk about other girls in a sexual way. I felt it was hurtful considering I told him I liked him. But I went on being the cool girl. He kept his phone very close to him the one weekend we were at his friend's birthday. As if he didn't want me to see who he was busy with so often. Even putting the phone down face-down.

He started messaging me less and less. Eventually until it was only once a week. I decided that he was breadcrumbing/benching me and that I wouldn't have it anymore. Felt I deserved more than that. So one day he messages a vague Hey how are you, and I responded by telling him:
We've known each other long enough and can surely be honest with each other now. And that we both know this is going nowhere. So he can stop the forced interactions (like the generic How are you stuff) and feeling like he has to talk to me because he doesn't have the courage to say he isn't interested, and that there are no hard feelings. If I see him we can still be friendly, but that the current arrangement wasn't working for me.

He responded a little bitter, saying he just thought of me and figured he'd say hello but okay then - he'll leave me alone. Wished him a happy birthday a week after that (as I do every year) and he didn't bother responding. 

Later also heard from a friend of his that I ""broke up"" a four year relationship apparently (him and his ex). Don't know why he'd say that when I never was involved with him. And because he's non-committal now what am I supposed to do? Tolerate being one of many?

I've been dreaming a lot about him lately and it makes me question myself. Some of my friends think he's a nice guy but just insecure. Everyone thinks he's a nice guy and he's friends with everyone, captain of the 1st team town's rugby club etc. But I felt he was just using me. Now I'm starting to doubt myself."
dating_advice,I'm so excited/nervous about going out on a date with a guy (36M) I (20F) really like that I was thinking of just cancelling out of nerves. Please help me out!,"So I've liked him since last year when we started working together and the more time's gone on, the more I've started liking him. I made a post on another sub about it and the advice was mixed of whether to go for it or not because of the age. 

I decided to just go for it and ask him out. And he said yes! I think he was as shocked as I was that I liked him, and that I asked him out. So we're going for breakfast/coffee on Saturday morning. 

But god I'm soooo nervous! I haven't been on a date in so long and the last time I did, it was awful. I've never been out on a date with someone with this much of an age gap so I expect him to be a lot mature than most of the dates I've been out with (plus I know him well too so that's a plus right?) but I'm worried if I act too immature around him! And in my head I'm thinking it's just coffee, don't get too worked up over it. 

How do I sit looking at him at work for the next 2 days looking at him knowing we're going out and not say anything to anyone? I like him so much, I just don't want to fuck it up."
dating_advice,She still did not reply to my last chat message and its been more than 3 days already,"Hello! So I have a crush on this girl and we are just acquiantance. Last week, we went on a huge conference event that lasted 2 days. We both already knew each other before the conference event. I knew she would come because I messaged her last time that I will go and she told me she would also go to that conference. We told each other that see you on the conference event.

We bumped each other during the course of breaks in that conference, said hi to each other. But we did not really talk much in person because she was with her friends and I was also busy by that time and I'm with my friends. After the conference event last Saturday, I messaged her on how was the conference. We chatted a bit and had a good conversation but she really took a long time to reply to my last chat messages.

Well one time her best friend offered me a ride home last time. Only 2 of us in the car. Then she kept pushing me on telling her on who is my crush. She also told me that if I tell her who is my crush, she will help me to set up on that person she knows

Well, I only know one common friend of her best friend and its her who is my current crush. Sooo yeah that is what I thought. My crush also invited me to an event before I message her.

Sooo yeah, right now idk if my crush likes me because I only know one common friend that I interact with and which is her

Like after I mentioned my crush name in a car in a casual conversation, she pauses a bit then she answered. And like afterwards she kept pushing me who is my crush

So yep, she did not reply back to my last chat message. Its been more than 72 hours and idk what happened. Idk if I am just overthinking this but I don't want to think ill thoughts about her ghosting me or something. Any opinions?"
dating_advice,I'm at a loss,"So last week I [M23] finally built up the courage to tell my coworker [F20] that I like her. I was unsure of what her response would be but was optimistic as I felt the feeling was mutual. Her response was to completely ignore me and continue doing what she was doing. I took this as a rejection and continued about my life and didn't see her again til Sunday when I blatantly avoided her. Monday I finally spoke to her again, expecting some awkwardness or coldness but experienced no real change in her attitude towards me. Today however she seemed very upset at me, practically refusing to talk to me and avoiding me most of the day. I'm really at a loss here as to why there would be such a night and day change. Any advice would be appreciated."

dating_advice,"I've (25M) returned to college, but am inexperienced in dating. How do I do basically go about it?","The gist of my past: hardcore Catholic that lived with verbally abusive family up until 22. Became atheist and have done some incredible soul searching finally feeling comfortable being me. I am very confident in myself and (I would say) a pretty darn good conversationalist even with total strangers. Talking to girls is no issue for me. Im always told I look really young so I fit right in. I'd say I'm a 7/10, think kinda like Michael Kelso but in an average way. Also I've been trying to get SUPER active in tons of things.

Basically I'm as virgin as they come though. Never really dated, kissed, etc. So how do I advance a relationship BEYOND friends? Is it just time and subtle hints? Or should I try to make attempts to move faster? Oftentimes I feel like I come across as gay more than someone who has sexual or romantic interests in them. So how do I go about it now?"
dating_advice,[SERIOUS] Scared or Tired?,"Before you get mad and say ""You're too young to know, experience and expect those things"" Read first.

Me (16F) is now ""scared"" to try to date again.


So, I met this guy (16M) who I thought was a real deal. He was talented, very passionate. A gamer, a keyboard nerd. He loved playing instruments and loved biking on his spare time.  I really liked him for 3 months before he said that he'd court me. 
*For those who don't know what courting is, it is a tradition in our place where the guy learns to win a woman's heart by taking her out, going on dates, sends her letters, give her flowers or just simply being a gentleman before they become official and be in an exclusive boy-girl relationship.

After a month of him courting me, he gave up. I guess I was too much for him? During that month, I gave all my best as if I was the one courting him, which I think was my mistake. 

When he broke things off he said that He couldn't keep up with what I was giving him and that he can't return it. He also said that I deserved better. He was different. The things I felt for him was different compared to the others. 

Almost a year has passed and I still couldn't get over him. I tried doing methods like blocking him, stopped talking to him, deleted everything about him but I still couldn't.  We don't talk anymore and I still couldn't figure out why I didn't move on.


Like a said, almost a year has passed, and one of my ""classmates"" (16M) took interest in me. Although I am not sure if he liked me, he is giving hints. He became friendlier, he flirted with me and often left a message (which was unusual because we never talked)


I kinda liked him. Well- Kinda. I only liked him if he wasn't talking to me or chatting me or if he was just in the distance. I didn't like him when he talked to me, flirted with me or gave me the attention I used to like getting from people.


I think I was traumatized from the fact that I gave my all to a person in the past who just left me. I'm afraid to be attached again. I am afraid to motivate someone and let him motivate me but just leaves me. I guess it was my mistake. But now I think I won't be ready to like anyone again. Just the thought of being left alone again was enough to stop me from developing any feelings for a person. Even friends. 

I shut my friends out of my life and be cold because I fear that they'd leave me alone like he did. 


I need advice. One to open my heart maybe? I need words of wisdom.

dating_advice,girl [21f] i've been seeing [20m] doesn't text back,"So for some backstory, me and this girl worked together a few years ago, talked a lot and hung out outside of work, had crushes on eachother, but I was in a relationship, so we just flirted. We started texting a month and a half ago and the other day was our 3rd date.

She's very intimate in person, and it's all smiles and laughs. The first date we held hands and she put both of her hands in mine, second date cuddled in the theatre and made out, the other day made out again, and when she left me she kissed me like four times. Like, she called me sexy, kissed me, smiled at me, and then kissed me again. I didn't initiate.

The thing is, she doesn't text back. During our recent date she brought up that she's a bad texter, and I said ""yeah, you leave me on read a lot"" (playfully), and she laughed and said she forgets. I didn't make a big deal out of it. She's active on Messenger, and during our last date was on her phone when I was filling up gas, then pulled it close to her body and closed out of it when I got back to the car (?), so I know she gets what I send to her, just doesn't open it. For example, 8 hours ago I asked if I could see her either next week or sometime after work, she responded ""I'd like that"", I asked her which one, she never responded, but has been active on messenger, and sent me a Snapchat.

I don't know what's going on here. I like her, but this gives me a weird feeling."

Basically idk when it started to occur to me, might be from the fact I tried to write her gm and gn everyday (purely because I can't stop thinking about her) and she barely says it back, how do I stop being so needy and caring about a person I just feel gives a good vibe that clearly doesn't share the same energy?"

dating_advice,Love or be loved?,So after my ex 18F and I 19M broke up with me(she has problems to deal with) I've been thinking about ways to improve myself. This question came to mind and I can't figure it out. Is it better to be the person who is in love in the relationship or to be the person who is loved... assuming the person feelings or yours aren't clear.
dating_advice,Should I Be Worried,"I'm a 27M and I matched with a 26F on hinge a few weeks ago. She's from the city I live in but had just moved 4 hours away to start her last semester of grad school. She said she was intending to move back to my city after the semester, and I have family in the city she goes to grad school in so I figured I'd try the whole long distance thing. We really hit things off at first. We texted for hours a day, very similar hobbies, just lots of chemistry overall, or so it seemed. I had plans to visit her next month as I'd be in her neck of the woods anyways. But lately the texts have stopped. I haven't heard from her in over 24 hours and I'm not sure what to do. On one hand I know she's in grad school and that can be very demanding and maybe she just really doesn't have a lot of time to text right now. But on the other hand I kind of have a sixth sense for when I'm being ghosted and those senses are going off right now. I don't want to further stress her out with incessant texts but I also don't like the fact that I haven't got a reply in over a day. Am I overacting or am I right to be worried? Thanks in advance!"

dating_advice,I (21m) need help rekindling things with my (20f) ex.,"My girlfriend and I of 4 months broke up a little over a month ago on very good terms, we both were crying and basically had agreed that taking breaks aren't a smart idea so she decided it would be best for me that she would have to step away. I was a mess and super depressed and she basically said that you need to work on yourself because I just can't be the one to make you do it. Since then I've taken the biggest steps I physically could have in life, making doctor's appointments and therapist appointments. Going back to college, and just overall finally am feeling like my happy and confident self again. I've tried talking to some other girls since and it just doesn't feel right and all I think about is her. We're still on good terms and she will respond and stuff if I reach out to her. My question is, is how do I start to give her the idea that I want to try again and show her that I finally have changed for the better without just saying it straight up. I love this girl so much, mostly because she was the one that made me want to change who I was, to be the best I could be, and that's when I realized oh crap I can't lose her like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! We are sorta texting now, she's very busy with work and stuff so she does respond when she isn't busy but I'm not sure on how to really push over telling her that I would like to show her that I've changed and that I'm now ready to be the guy she knows that I can be."

Before we started dating, we were very good friends. We connected over many mutual interests and became very close. We ended up hooking up one night, and it kind of just snowballed from there. 

I was adamant in the beginning that we consider our friendship and make sure that we really wanted to take things to the next level. I was clear on my needs and expectations in relationships (I like a certain amount of independence to focus on my small business, I explained my love languages and asked about his, I was very hesitant) because I had just gotten out of a relationship 8 months before and didn‚Äôt want to go through heartbreak again any time soon, or ruin our friendship, or end up somehow hurting him. I explained that I currently identify as bisexual and am still figuring out my sexuality and really struggling with that. He discussed this openly with me and even said he‚Äôd be fine with me having the freedom to experiment and explore that more on my own if I needed to - I have taken him up on this and it went surprisingly smoothly between us.

I asked him questions about his goals, etc. I was trying to decide if it would be smart for us to take the leap. There were a few red flags (for me): he didn‚Äôt really have any goals or aspirations aside from buying a house, he was still living with his parents (which I already knew) and didn‚Äôt really care to travel. Independence, setting goals, and traveling are very important aspects of my lifestyle/personality, so the lack of ambition bugged me a bit, but I tried to brush it off because he was so great in all other ways. 

During this transitional time, we were meeting up at all hours of the night, taking long drives together, parking, etc.. things were intense and exciting. We were going out with friends, getting drinks and dinner, going hiking with friends, etc. Eventually it just evolved into a relationship. Less than 4 months in, my lease ended at my apartment and my roommate and I were going our separate ways. My boyfriend insisted we find a place together on multiple occasions, but I wasn‚Äôt ready. Hypocritically, I accepted my mom‚Äôs offer to move home (temporarily - set a 6 month plan for myself) so that I could save money and plan my next move. During that time, he and I had virtually no alone time since we were living with our parents (about 20m apart), so the time we did get alone was always savored. We got even closer than before. Looking back, we were clearly in the honeymoon phase. A few months later, we found our apartment. 
 
We have now lived together for a year. We got a dog together at the end of August, whom we both love more than life itself. 

All that said, I am starting to feel completely apathetic about my boyfriend. I noticed changes in him as soon as we moved in. 

‚Ä¢He can spend HOURS wrapped up in a video game. I‚Äôve seen him go 6 hours without any break except to literally run to the bathroom and back to the TV. 

‚Ä¢He spends this time talking with his friends who are constantly making extremely crude/sexist/homophobic jokes. Though he doesn‚Äôt make them himself, he never says sh*t to prevent it and laughs at these jokes regularly, which just makes me less interested in him. I thought having the dog would pull him away from gaming. I thought wrong. (Note: This is not why we got our dog. We had both had dogs while growing up and wanted to adopt for long before we were together.)

‚Ä¢He almost never initiates any kind of intimacy. I‚Äôve communicated with him about this on multiple occasions and he always gets defensive and says his ex ‚Äúconditioned him‚Äù not to do this because he would always get rejected and that this is just ‚Äúhow he is‚Äù... funny because that was not at all the case in the beginning. I‚Äôm not talking about sex exclusively. I could use a good hug or kiss each day that isn‚Äôt obligatory because he‚Äôs leaving the house or coming home. He‚Äôs also only complimented me maybe 5 times in the almost 2 years we have been together, which combined with the lack of intimacy leaves me feeling very lonely and unappealing. 


‚Ä¢He is very critical of how I clean or do dishes, while he leaves grease in bowls after they‚Äôre ‚Äúclean‚Äù or leaves piles of dishes until I get sick of waiting for him to take his turn and just do them myself while he is gaming.  He has expressed that he feels he pulls more weight than me, while I cook dinner 4-6x a week and he cooks maybe once a month, and I do dishes probably 65% of the time, and regularly cover extra expenses to avoid having money conversations with him. (See below)

‚Ä¢He has a very negative outlook on anything money related and has no savings whatsoever due to his student debt. Every time we go grocery shopping, have a vet bill, or have to pay rent, he gets extremely anxious and negative, makes a whole thing about it between us, and I feel like I have to talk him through it. Yet he has INSISTED for months that we need to buy a house together until I finally was able to get through to him that I‚Äôm not ready to share that kind of legal financial burden at this point in my life. 

‚Ä¢He works for his family‚Äôs business, so he is always bringing home family drama and lets any kind of negativity with his father consume his attitude for the remainder of the day/night. Since our apartment is TINY, I have literally nowhere to get away from it unless I leave. 

‚Ä¢He chews tobacco and leaves bottles of dip spit all around the apartment, brushing his teeth maybe twice a week and showering maybe 2-3x per week. 

I am going to stop these bullets because I feel like a complete a**hole complaining like this, but I needed to get this out. I can‚Äôt talk to friends or family about it because I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm talking badly about my boyfriend. He can be a very fun person to be around. He doesn‚Äôt abuse me, and he‚Äôs good to his family. Point is, there are good qualities. I just feel so pent up and frustrated and lost, especially because it seems that every serious relationship I‚Äôve been in, the guy had several of these same issues. I feel like my life is a giant Groundhog Day... I‚Äôm going in circles. 

Please give me ANY advice... We discussed custody in the case of a breakup for the dog before we adopted - we would split time with him, so I can figure that out. There‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôd leave if I thought there was a possibility I wouldn‚Äôt see our dog again.
But although I could afford our apartment alone, my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have the option to move back home anymore and absolutely cannot afford any apartment on his own even this one... I feel like we have no options to get out of this, and I‚Äôve been lonely and unhappy for so long."
dating_advice,I (16M) asked out a girl (15F) and I asked her out and idk if she actually wants to date.,"here's what I said

as a little note she has been sick for like a week.

me:""Hey, I was just wondering if you wanted to get coffee or something after school tomorrow or Friday. ONLY if you feel up to it.""

her:""Hey! you're so sweet! yeah so I'm still kind of feeling iffy from when I was sick so now's not the best time, I'm sorry :(""

me: ""no no that's perfectly fine i'd rather have you feel better than suffer.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so confused I'd really like some help"
dating_advice,Dating is making me scary depressed...,"This might be lengthy but I need to rant a bit in order to get the advice I need... it could save my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 28 years old, almost 29. I was in an engagement that ended poorly a few years ago. Long story short, my ex fell into alcoholism and it was abusive towards me (both verbally and physical). She kept my ring and it was this horrific split. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the time I needed to regroup. Thought I was getting my life on track. I even went back to school and got a degree in computer science. I was doing it all for LOVE. I want that woman in my life like all these other people have. The one that loves me. That sticks with me. So I did self improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated and I attempted to find a job. Success! Great career! I moved to a new city and I started dating someone. Turns out, I don't think I was ready to be mislead and find out she was screwing other guys on the side... THANKS BUMBLE! 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to date again after that 6 month long heart ache. I tried Hinge and found the craziest of the crazies. The one that just wanted to use me for good times and dates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, my employment tanked and I was laid off. I decided to take a break from dating and regroup. I returned home to my mom's condo with my tail between my legs and I want to move to this one city in particular. I have job prospects and they look good. So I made a Hinge account to see what dating in that city was like. Maybe since it's only an hour away, I could maybe spark something now and move there to someone? Wouldn't that be great?! 

&amp;#x200B;

WRONG! What I did was have a torrent of women match with me... I had 6 in a month I thought were going to be a connection only to have the dates crumble in the talking phase. I've had women match with me and they end up deleting me mid message. I had a few super into me then, ghost! 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I have a lot of good things going for me. I'm 6'4"", in good shape, fairly attractive, college degrees, and a good career (once I find a job again). 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm jumping the gun and need to get my life back in order first? But this loneliness I'm experiencing is too much. I'm so jaded by women at this point I could die. I literally feel so choked up and frustrated inside. The stress and agony of not having anyone is literally causing me to walk around with a pit in my stomach, severe anxiety, and a feeling like I'm dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been to a therapist but it just didn't help. She looked at me like I was totally insane and said, ""You're tall and seriously good looking...""  Then she went on about it's them and not me. Not a great help!

&amp;#x200B;

I lay awake at night depressed and scared I could end up alone forever because of how I now feel from women. I just don't know what to do and feel like I'm going crazy from the rejection and feeling this is NEVER going to happen for me!

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's the dating apps, or maybe I should get my life together? Maybe I should wait to meet someone in person? I'm a mess and I just need advice..."

dating_advice,Is ending a good first date with an intense make out sesh a bad idea?,"I had a really great and long first date with a guy and we agreed we would do it again.

Im kinda nervous that now it‚Äôs gonna be all about sex for him. I know it depends on the person, but in general is this suggested against on a first date / while you‚Äôre still getting to know someone? Or is this worry baseless?"

We are always in a group setting and there are basically little to no opportunities where she is alone and I could ask her out. I could just ask her out in the group but there are two things about that. 1) I don't feel brave enough to do it with an audience and 2) I feel like it would be a little unfair to put her on the spot like that. So that basically only leaves me with messaging her  but I would really prefer to ask her out in person. So I'm basically looking for advice on how I should proceed, maybe there is something I'm not thinking of."

dating_advice,"I'm catching feelings for this girl, and I'm unsure how to feel about it right now...","I here's a little backstory,

Its my second semester in college and I'm wanting to get into a relationship, hookups are not my thing and never really have been. Cut to literally 3 weeks ago, my friend invites me out with him to meet a couple of his roommate's. I hit it off with everyone pretty well and we start to have a few drinks before heading out for the night. When I walked in I noticed this girl out of the corner of my eye and immediately thought that she was my type and I'd go chat her up later at the club. My same friend that brought me told me shes asking about who I am and she thinks I'm cute.

Fast forward about an hour and we started dancing together, drinks wear off, we head home with the group. Her and I cuddle for about 2 hours with everyone and were all just chatting, we had a really good time and hit it off super well. We decide to leave, I kiss her goodbye and she tells me to text her.

After that I asked her out to go get food at a local spot in our college town, I picked her up and we both went out. We talked till closing at the restaurant and had a stupid amount in common. Its actually ridiculous, we went back to mine cuddled and watched a movie, sex on the first date isn't my thing so I decided to keep the pants on (This was also because I was a virgin and really nervous). We just cuddled and watched one of our favorite horror shows on Netflix. She then proceed to tell me that she really didn't want to get in a relationship in college, or at least not in freshman year. I was super bummed, but she finished that statement with "" I haven't liked anyone in a really long time, but I like you."" Both of us decided to see where it goes from here.

We have hung out every weekend since, shes slept over, we go get food all the time, and I've come to find out shes begun to tell her friends about me, I've caught stupid hard feels for this girl. And all I'm trying to find out is should I begin  to bring up the fact that I want to date her, or is it still a little to early. Its slightly came up before but that was a week ago and I didn't want to push it in order to seem not clingy. Help"
dating_advice,Why do people on here pretend like attractive girls dont get approached/hit on a ton?,"This is so wrong that it couldn't be any more wrong

Attractive girls get hit on everywhere. They get approached in the mall, at the bus stop, in the metro, in shops, stores, coffee shops, etc etc

Not to mention all the attention they get online now thanks to the internet. Ever see an attractive girl's DMs? Tinder? OLD?"
dating_advice,I‚Äôm falling for a girl that I‚Äôm really not physically attracted to.,"This girl is absolutely awesome. I feel genuinely at peace when I‚Äôm with her. She understands my passions. We laugh together, have a good time, and share the same deeply rooted beliefs, but I just am NOT attracted to her, and it has me in knots. Honestly if I could find one thing about her that I found attractive, I‚Äôd date her in a heartbeat, but I don‚Äôt. Yet, I still feel butterflies because of how awesome she is. I just know that if I dated her, I‚Äôll always be thinking about how I don‚Äôt find her beautiful, and that kills me."
dating_advice,How long to wait to ask for a second date?,This is my first experience dating btw. I have known this girl for years and I asked her out on a date and she said yes. We had our first date and it went really good and we continue to text. We went out today (Wednesday) and I'm wanting to ask her to go out again Friday or Saturday night. Is that too early to ask for a second date?
dating_advice,So I think this guy just friend zoned me,"So I haven‚Äôt been in a relationship for quite sometime and haven‚Äôt talked to anyone in a long time either, I played the game as a single female in my early twenty‚Äôs. I ended up meeting this guy randomly in my group of friends on vacation. We hooked up a couple times and have been talking everyday ever since and hung out alone a couple times. He‚Äôs into me I‚Äôm into him. I met his friends and they were cool, he tells me all about himself and always is the center of attention. I don‚Äôt share much about myself I like to keep it a mystery to them and I don‚Äôt expect much out of any guy I talk to, I just expect disappointment in the end, hence why I‚Äôm single still. I‚Äôm not clingy at all and I rarely answer texts in timely manner. He will snap me and text me a few times before I‚Äôll answer and I feel he craves the attention I don‚Äôt give him but I do show him mutual feelings and try the best I can with being so busy. Randomly in our texting conversation he sends paragraphs how he‚Äôs not looking for a relationship he enjoys time with me but he just got out of a relationship but loves what we have. I‚Äôm like okay? Why even bring that up when feelings is the last thing I talk about. He just goes back to sending me multiple texts and snaps like nothing happened. Is he playing games? Does he want me to chase? Or does he want to be chased?"
dating_advice,"Honestly so confused, just quick HS advice please","So I (16m) like this girl (16f) and we got pretty close in a couple months. Long story short we hated each other last year, but genuine insults because a joke to us this year and we started snapping back and forth. We started hanging out at school even though we have no classes together, she started showing hints, and after the exams finished this semester she started opening my chats instantly and all seemed well. Out of no were she stopped texting / snapping and I know for a fact I‚Äôve been ignored for the past 24 hours. I have a feeling that not everyone in her friend group likes me, she completely ignores them when I‚Äôm around, maybe one of her friends is giving her weird advice? Something similar has happened before, anyone know why she might be doing this?"
dating_advice,Should I even bother texting?,"I've been seeing a girl for a couple of months now and have went on a good amount of dates. At least for me, I believe we always had a good time.

We both are really busy during the weekday because of work and tend to only see each other once a week on the weekend. We aren't really ""old"" so we both still live with our parents for at least another year so it's hard finding time to see her aside from the weekend.

The problem is I don't know how texting should work or if I'm missing something. Basically she takes a really long time to respond literally for almost every message even if I respond to hers within a minute. Sometimes we are on the same conversation topic for literally the whole day because of this.

I don't know if I should just text her less often and only really use it to set up dates. I'm just not sure because I'm only seeing her once a week and sometimes once every 2 if we find ourselves busy."
dating_advice,I reached out to an old friend and I don‚Äôt know how to express romantic interest,"I reached out to an old friend of mine, I moved back into the area and I always have had a crush on him. We went on a hike he invited me on with other people. We live about 1.5 hours apart. We are texting and I will try to find a way to see him when I‚Äôm in his area. Not sure how to flirt or express romantic interest in something that was platonic. I suspect he may have previously been interested in me, but it‚Äôs been 10 years. I‚Äôd kick myself for not trying he‚Äôs really a cool dude."
dating_advice,"[18M] Where and how do I meet women older than me, like mid to late 20s or early 30s or so?","So, I'm 18 years old now. I've always been into older women but obviously have never been able to pursue this until now. I still have the barrier though of, well, being a high school student, which I'm afraid might be off-putting for many women. So I guess my questions are, where and how do I meet women within that age range or around that, and do I have any shot considering the fact that I'm still in high school. Just to clarify, I'm not looking to find a hook-up for casual sex, I want an actual loving relationship, the sex is secondary, if I just wanted that sort of physical pleasure I've got my own right hand. I want something more than that and am attracted to older women, so that's why I'm asking.  
  
If it helps, particularly for the how part of this, some details about myself: always got good grades, am decent enough looking, am interested in music, particularly hardcore punk/noise/midwest emo/post-hardcore and similar genres (although I don't play an instrument), I'm sort of an ambivert, I have a good sense of humor, and am a very compassionate person and want some sense of emotional security. As far as negatives, I'm sometimes quiet, can be a little socially awkward at times, I struggle to approach girls and women (partially for being shy with approaching new people, also partially for fear of being creepy, I don't wanna be THAT guy), and I can sometimes struggle to keep a good conversation going with people I don't share interests with or who just don't also keep conversations going. I also have the disadvantage of wanting more the kinda chicks who'll be able to wear the pants in the relationship when it calls for it, I'm not exactly a manly man who wants all the power in a relationship (definitely not effeminate either though, just want someone to be my equal or maybe take the reins)."
dating_advice,Me (21M) has developed feelings for an old friend (21F) and I don't know if I should pursue anything,"I'll develop here. We met again near the end of last year after not seeing each other since high school. Since then, we've been hanging out quite often, though not 1 on 1 yet (now, we've hung out plenty of times alone in our teens). Each time we meet, I feel this connection with her that definitely goes further than friendship. We can talk about anything, joke around easily, have a pretty similar outlook on life, we seem to be headed in a similar direction, too.

She's also not the touchy type, but last weekend we did have some contact, like her resting her head and hands on my arm while laughing, so this got me thinking she might be interested in me too. She also tweets a lot about things I seem to have an involvement with, but maybe I'm thinking about it too much.

Thing is, I don't know if I should pursue a relationship with her. True, I can see a future with her, but I don't want to lose a good friendship, either. We also have plenty of friends in common, being from a small town and all. I don't want to ruin that. I don't want to make things weird for our brothers, too, as they hang out a lot. It's not my inexperience in the dating world that scares me this time, but I feel uneasy when I think about taking the chance. I might love what springs out of this, but I'm too afraid. What can I do in either case?"

dating_advice,Dating in college is....,"In your experience was dating in college difficult? I go to a party school where finding people to casually hook up with on the weekend isn‚Äôt very hard at all, but finding a person to actually date seems impossible. This went from being fun to really unfulfilling. 

I‚Äôve went out of my way to try pursuing something a bit more serious this semester and it‚Äôs ended up ironically bad. One girl I kissed at a party and made plans to hang out with during the week only for her to tell me she kissed 2 other people after the same night (plans cancelled). Another I asked on a date when we were out with friends and she agreed but I found out the next day she has a semi-boyfriend and she thought it was a bad idea.

dating_advice,Getting Airbnb to sleep with girls after my breakup? Been out of the game for a year,"I (25M) Got dumped by my ex gf (21F) few months ago. We lasted a year. She dated a guy few days  after. 

So my friend and I are going to get an Airbnb and he‚Äôs bringing instagram model type chicks to stay with us for the weekend. He is trying to hook me up with one of them.  (They are on vacation and want to hangout)

I‚Äôve hooked up with girls but rejected them in the end because I still wasn‚Äôt over my ex. However this time I won‚Äôt let that be the case.

dating_advice,Just do it,"I just told a girl she was cute just to say it. I thought she was cute, and that was that. All I said, I‚Äôm not looking for anything, I just wanted to say you‚Äôre cute.

Is it safe to assume that sending chocs on Valentine's is fine? I would be out of town so couldn't do it personally"
dating_advice,All my relationships seem to fail because I'm scared to be affectionate and seem clingy,"Everytime I get into a relationship with someone who really cares about me I end up ruining it because of my inability to know when to make the next step and be more affectionate towards my SO and come off as uncaring and uninterested.

I'm a very unsociable person and until a few years ago I barely had any friends at all so I'm still getting use to the fact people would even want to be in a relationship to begin with

In my fear to not ruin it by seeming to clingy I end up coming off as cold and the relationship is soon ended. 

I really don't know how to fix this, I know I could force myself to be more affectionate towards my SO but I don't think I'd be comfortable doing so. 

I know this may seem stupid but I'll take any advice someone is willing to give me, I'm now in a relationship with this really great guy and I don't want to ruin it."
dating_advice,How to ask gf for some space,"Okay so I‚Äôve been with my gf for a little over a year now and I love her to pieces.

The problem comes that recently her roommate decided to live back home making her room into a single. We both live on campus and she has taken it upon herself to ask me to now sleep over in her empty dorm room with her every night. At first I really enjoyed this and thought it was special, we had agreed that it would be a weekend only event with the exception of Wednesday‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have any morning classes. Knowing she‚Äôs been stressed  I stayed over the entire week last week and she has now come to expect me to stay with her every night and gets very upset if I show any indication that I want to go sleep in my own dorm room. I know it sounds mean but I just want some me time and sleeping with her in a tiny bed is hard and as a result I haven‚Äôt gotten more than 4+ hours of sleep each night.

I have a second date with a lovely girl coming up on Friday, but I‚Äôm not expecting too much, plus she already blocked/unblocked me on ig to remove my follow.    We‚Äôre still going out, but that shit have me so much anxiety, I want to call her out on it, but I also don‚Äôt.    


Thanks for coming to my whineathon.    If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.   

I don‚Äôt think taking a step back from trying is really an option, since A. I like sex and B. I already did that for about half a year after my breakup."
dating_advice,What should I do?,"Sorry about any grammar/spelling mistakes it's late &amp; I'm not thinking quite clearly. 

So I (F25) am very much in love with my bf (M32). We have a amazing child. We've been together three years. The issue is our sex life. He is very insecure about his size.  He's ~5in hard so average size. It's just he constantly makes jokes about it and how I don't enjoy sex because of it. Which completely turns me off. Kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Also he's very clinical and silent in bed like he's trying to think through every thing he's doing. Which is something else that doesn't work for me I greatly enjoy dirty talk and passion. I've tried talking to him multiple times in and out of bed. Explained that his size isn't a negative factor in pleasuring me that I'd rather he focused more on foreplay because that's how I get off, not vaginally. I've tried asking for what I need while we're doing the deed. I've tried complimenting him when he does what I like. I've tried complimenting him on how hard he is and how much I enjoy him. I just don't know what else to do. Our sex life is almost nonexistent at this point. There's just no passion. Its so strange to me because in everything else he is a very confident person, cocky even. I'm afraid if this continues I'll have to end things. That will break my heart but sex is very important to me. I wouldn't want to end up meeting someone in the future who is passionate &amp; end up cheating because I'm so frustrated. If any one has any advice whatsoever I'd really appreciate it I don't want to break up our little family. 

Tl;dr My bf won't listen to what I like/is insecure in bed. We stopped having sex. I like sex. What should I do?"
dating_advice,How bad does it look if you‚Äôve been at a job for a year and don‚Äôt talk to anyone?,"

I had drama with one woman, that in my opinion, was not justified. I‚Äôve always been quiet but for the past few months, I walk in and leave without greeting anyone first/ only speak when spoken to. In my opinion, it is not my fault that people are shitty and dislike me for no reason. I‚Äôve always had this issue with people, from previous jobs and school. I‚Äôm quiet and don‚Äôt bother anyone,I‚Äôve shunned out everyone completely even more."
dating_advice,How to do Valentine's day with a new person just started dating?,"Been texting with this person for about 2 and a half months. We've gone on 5 dates. No sex, just makeout sessions and recently started to touch more. Taking it very slow so far.

With Valentine's Day coming up I'm not sure how to approach it. Should we just go out on a romantic date? Should I get her anything or is it too early? Box of chocolates? I'm not sure. Of course I will talk to her about it since a lot of people aren't a fan of going out on Valentine's Day, but just wanted to get some opinions."
dating_advice,Does She[18F] like me[20M]? HELP - I'll give an award to the most helpful answer,"I \[just turned 20\] met this girl \[18F\], at my job in college. We are both college students. Right now I am in a situation where I like her but I am not sure if she likes me back. I've never had any female friends so I'm not sure if this is just what's it's like having a female friend or if she likes me. Keep in mind, we spend around 1-4 hours together per week and it's mostly during work. We do however text a decent amount of times, not much but not too little (she is almost always near the top of my most recently texted ppl list). Here are some pointers:

&amp;#x200B;

* She acted pretty awkward at first
   * We were at a potluck for work around the 2nd week of the new school year. We were in line getting food and she offered to give me a fork, but I already had a fork so I respectfully said no thanks. She replied with ""oh ok"" and awkwardly took 2 forks lol. I am not sure if that's just her being socially awkward or what.
* In the first quarter of the academic year (now we're in the 2nd quarter) I left earlier than she did on the days she worked. One day I was getting ready to leave when she asked me if I could stay with her until her shift ended.
   * Afterwards I ended up staying w/ her until her shift ended for the rest of the quarter.
* Also during the first quarter she asked me if I ever felt lonely. Of course I do but I tried to play it cool and said something stupid like ""nah bruh"".
* Whenever she is with me she talks about all of her problems and what makes her stressed out. Most girl's I've interacted with don't really talk with me much, even when we are in a 1-on-1 setting like in this situation, so idk what this means, maybe she just likes to talk? She doesn't talk with other coworkers as much as she does w/ me tho.
* Whenever she's at work and I'm not she often sends me texts asking me simple Q's. Questions like ""where is the \[specific stack of paper that is always in the same place\]?"". Is she trying to start a conversation? Or maybe she just feels intimidated to ask our boss so she asks me instead? 
* Recently we've been talking about anxiety / mental health and she kinda opened up to me and mentioned how she feels most of her friendships only exist during class, so I mentioned I felt the same way. Also we have been talking about other topics and how that makes us feel.
* She was reading a couple of stories and she mentioned how one of them reminded her of me. It was a story about Artificial Intelligence (I'm a CS major).
* **MOST IMPORTANTLY SHE SENT ME A '*****heyyy*****' TEXT.**
   * Not sure if this is just a meme or if it actually means she is interested. Yes there were 3 y's in her text. She followed it up with something about my midterm cuz I mentioned that I had one today.

Usually when I am around girls I feel an immense pressure to keep the conversation going and I feel very uncomfortable when there is silence, and I usually cannot think of anything to say. In contrast, with this girl I work with, I feel comfortable and there are rarely any silent parts in our conversations, and when there are, I don't feel uncomfortable. In fact I felt so comfortable around her that I even asked for her number (my first time asking a girl for a #). The reason why I'm making this post is because Valentine's day is approaching and I'm not sure if I should make my move.

**THANKS FOR READING MY INCOHERENT THOUGHTS, I WILL GIVE AN AWARD TO WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST THOUGHTFUL ANSWER.** If you have any questions that would help you give me better advice pls feel free to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR -** I like a girl at work and I am unsure if she likes me. She talks a lot and I'm not super experienced with being around girls so idk if she likes me. Also she sent a 'heyyy' text message."
dating_advice,How should I handle this?,"So a childhood buddy of mine(Senior HS) recently got himself into talking to this girl he likes. Initially i was proud and was rooting for him (College Sophmore). 
Now he's been trying a little too hard. This started with him texting her every so and so. Now he's been texting her during the middle of a team based game we both play.
   It started off joking, then reasonably, then serious. I said that it wasn't cool that he's going afk in the middle of the rounds over texting her. I said ""dont commit to the game if your going to be afk"". Then he started snapping at me about it and some words were said there. I blew it off but that anger is still there. 
   Ive been single long enough to see stuff like this happen over and over. If he gets the girl there will be plently of time to be with her. I wouldn't be suprised if he has a hard time getting some time to himself later on.
   After i got offline i wanted to drop contact with him for a long while nearing permanently. But im better than that, but i just don't know how i should go about it. I considered being frank and telling him there's more to relationships than that but i think thats clouding his eyes so it would be hard to tell him. What do you think?"
dating_advice,How to deal with rejection for the first time?,"I (20F) have never asked anyone out before and in my boring life, no one ever asked me out either. But I really liked this guy at the place I work. After weeks of struggling, I finally asked him out today. Considering I am introverted, it was very hard for me. However, I did it and got friendzoned. Now I don‚Äôt know how I feel about it. I am happy that he straight up told me that he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way but at the same time I feel like I should be sad and I kinda have this emptiness inside that feels like nothing. I don‚Äôt know how should I deal with this. Also I will be seeing him every other day. I don‚Äôt know how I should act either"
dating_advice,Is this a good idea?,"22 male.

Ive never had any luck with dating at all, I have no friends. guys or girls...

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about offering a girl or girls on dating sites money to go on at least 1 first date with me, (just put the money offer in my bio type of thing)  just a regular date, I thought that 250 bucks or 300 would be fair, I just hope they actually show up and don't rip me off. Ive never been on a date before and idek how it will go. Idk how to dress, I have some ralph lauren clothes I could wear, idk if that's overdoing it though, ive never really tried this before, any tips or suggestions? I plan to pay for everything as well. but I don't even know where to go lol ive literally never did this before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figure that once the first date is out of the way that maybe she will actually like me and than I can do a second one."
dating_advice,I told him that I have a hard time letting people get close to me and almost pushed him away when I ended things.. Now we're seeing each other again. I feel like he might be insecure because of how I acted.,"I have a lot of trust issues because of my past, but I've done a lot of work with myself.

We've been seeing each other for three months. We only get to see each other on weekends, 'cause there's distance between us. I'm starting to like him and I'm afraid he's gonna find someone else.

I don't know if he just wants to take things slow, isn't he just not that into me, is he giving me space or what it is with that things don't seem to be getting anywhere. I want to be his girlfriend. I can't ask 'cause I fear rejection and abandonment so much. How could I get closer with him?"
dating_advice,I'm so fucking torn!,"If I go off of everything my ex told me, it's just not the right time, we both need to work on ourselves and shes now single working toward her goals. Neither of us have our own place, she and I both basically live paycheck to paycheck, shes told me numerous times that she still loves me and misses me but cant have someone in her life while shes doing her thing.... But the other half of me is almost certain she left me for another guy.. I dont have any legitimate evidence that she did, and trying to explain the details here as to while I think it so would take too long... I'm lost and alone now with no one that I can legitimately talk to about this but her, but we agreed to be done talking about us and I cant seem to let it go no matter how busy i keep myself... dafuq do i do with myself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
dating_advice,In a bit of a conundrum here,"So I match with this cutie on tinder, she‚Äôs a nurse I‚Äôm an EMT(I feel like this was a bad beginning to an Avril Lavigne song) anyway we talk for a few days and agreed to meet for a drink at this random spot downtown. It was pretty chill, we laughed, talked about some plans big and small, what we were looking for and just hung out for a few hours. It was getting late so I told her I was gonna pay us out and go home to my dog. That was cool with her. Parted ways and kept the conversation going. We vibe well you could say.

Anyway today we agreed to meet for lunch and I said I would scoop her up from the hospital. She was super excited. I tell her which color truck I‚Äôm in and she makes her way over and hops in. She seems a little less excited. With nurses being nurses I figured it may have just been a bit rough so I just aim to make her laugh. I carry most of the conversation through lunch, pay us out and then take her back. I text her about 30 mins later and tell her I hope the day goes by easy. A few hours pass by (medical field...so I‚Äôm not concerned with how long it takes to get back to me) and she texts me : ‚Äú I‚Äôm sorry I was just really thinking you had a nicer truck and that bothers me because it was sort of embarrassing. Idk if I can do this. You‚Äôre really sweet and smart and you‚Äôre super funny. I really thought you had your shit together and this was a rude awakening.‚Äù
I sit on this for a minute because I didn‚Äôt think to talk money on the first or second date. I‚Äôll admit I was a little offended at first because she had no idea about the situation. So I responded with ‚Äúhey I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from. The truck is an old farm truck I bought for $600, it‚Äôs rough but it runs and gets me to and from my jobs. I‚Äôve also paid off nearly all of my debt minus the $3,500 I have left which will be gone on the next three months. I have $12,000 in my savings with $2k in my checking. And earned my credit score of 772. I‚Äôve got my shit together, I just want to be free from debt and have a solid start to getting old, I‚Äôm 30. I don‚Äôt make too much but I just try to make every penny count for something. 
She texted back eventually apologizing and saying that she didn‚Äôt consider this and how we should go to dinner soon. But I‚Äôm torn on what to do, I was judged super hard for not giving a damn what I drive and now that I told her everything I‚Äôm wondering if now she‚Äôs just super judgmental, if she‚Äôs sincerely sorry or if now she knows I‚Äôm very stable and now wants that financial benefit. 
Everything was cool until that and now I‚Äôm really hesitant. 

I need some input, some friends say block her and move on, others say let her try to redeem herself. But that kinda put up some red flags making me curious as to her intentions now"
dating_advice,I like this girl (18F) and I dont know if she likes me back despite my observations (18M),"I've known this girl since freshman year, I was the quiet one and she was pretty loud and pushed to be my friend despite her shy tendencies. She was pretty much my twin, we scarily liked the same games, topics of conversation, memes and food combos like toasted bread with sugar and syrup. (I'm not joking i sent her a picture of it and expected her to be disgusted she sent the same thing and we had a great laugh about it). We also one texted each other at the same time about Nightcore music. Which was creepy. I started to like her vibe when this occured.

 I've forced the thought of me liking her down because she was in a relationship of a guy I'm not too fond of because he like to call me a racial slur. (I'm black hes not). Not only that he recieved more than he gave and she just allowed this toxicity to slide because he said he would change. He never did she would always call me crying at 10 pm asking me to get on Modern Warfare, to distract her from her distress. I would also stay up on the phone to talk to her while she tried to sleep. I started to like her more after this.

At the time we were both depressed and that really connected us more I feel. And we would always help each other which connected us even more. We would always be flirtatious and I have always thought it to be us joking, looking back on it I might've missed the hints. Back then we would always say how much we appreciated each other and one time she told me how we can be best friends without liking each other. And I've always kept that in mind.

Now presently we hung out for a couple of days back to back during our winter break and during school and even after work sometimes, she has broken up with her ex in December and I've been comforting her making sure shes alright. When we would hang out in would notice a couple things. How her body language would be more touchy than normal how she would hip bumb me sometimes, she would move closer when we would walk beside each other. Shes even said straight up ""let's hold hands"" and we would walk around campus holding hands. After class we would meet up to hang out at lunch and she would run right into me for a hug. I've once mentioned that we should sit with some of my friends bc walking around was boring and she would agree and implore ""we should tell them we are dating"" I figured she was joking and said ""that's a great idea"" and started to walk towards them and then she shyed from the idea not 2 seconds after. Shes even laid her head on my shoulder and I would do the same, that's a key sign for me at least that someone likes me. Yet my judgment has been wrong before.

I've never hit on her before and I classify her as my best friend  my only best friend actually. And I dont know if these are hints, if I'm just a distraction, or a rebound. My other female friends would tell me shes figuring out if she likes me but her flirtatious banter has made me wonder if shes serious or not bc shes never done this before. She also still hangs out with her ex and has gotten back with him before so I want to be extra careful. I am afriad of losing my best friend, as these are struggling times for my family and work. 

Tl;dr my best friend has recently made some hints yet I dont know if they are banter or not as shes pretty flirtatious. Shes been holding my hand, saying we are dating as a joke, and resting her head on my shoulder, for the past few days. She recently broke up with her bf. Yet they've done that twice. I want to trust my judgment yet I am too afraid to lose my best friend to ""just go for it."" Any advice?"
dating_advice,I like someone who doesn‚Äôt like me in that way whatsoever. Do I just give up and move on.,"Idk why I‚Äôm asking, I guess to be sure. We don‚Äôt really talk at all anyways and she snaps almost everyone but me. I probably know the answer but I want to be sure :/"
dating_advice,Dated this guy for a month and he‚Äôs been MIA for a few days.,"I started dating this guy the beginning of this year. It was all good. We went on a few dates. He was 28 and I just turned 22 so there was some hesitation from both of us but we really enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. 
He was consistent in texting me and when he would lag I would just assume he was busy with work and then he would say he was busy with work. There was once where he went MIA for a day then I texted him checking in because I knew he was dealing with family issues. He was sweet and always wanted me to spend the night, would cook, basically a all around gentleman. 
But since I went out with my friend he hasn‚Äôt really texted me? The last thing I said was ‚ÄúI did have fun. We should come to this bar. I think you would like it.‚Äù
I was going to wait and see if he texted me for my birthday at least but nothing still. We weren‚Äôt official or anything but I‚Äôm debating on checking in again or just leaving it as is. He made lots of plans for us and didn‚Äôt seem like a person to go ghost but maybe I just didn‚Äôt get any hints. 
I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Like a part of me wants to check in and the other part doesn‚Äôt want to just out of fear of annoying him."
dating_advice,Was he making a subtle pass at me over text?,[removed]
dating_advice,(22F) Feeling lost after the third date (24M). What should I do?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I (22F) have gone on three dates with this guy (24M) and we clicked really well. We met on OkCupid and each date than the last seem to be more comfortable as we get to know each other. I just got out of a two year relationship and wasn't really looking for another but I can see myself with him. Thing is, I'm not sure if it's just me who hasn't been in the dating game in a while but it's rare for me to find three successful dates in a row and I'm feeling lost what to do from here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's call him Joe. First date, Joe and I went to a Japanese restaurant and to an arcade and spent the remaining of the night at his place watching some Netflix and he dropped me off. Second date, he treated me out to an Italian dinner and afterwards had sex at his place. Third date, I took him out to sushi and went bowling and again went to his place to watch some Netflix resulting into sex lol. Joe is super sweet and understanding on top of his very romantic gestures which I'm not used to. When he won a bowling round, he wanted a peck on the cheek as a prize, often hold my hand during outings and during driving, and ask to cuddle after sex. He'll even say things like,"" Where have you been my whole life?"" and texts me a good morning/night. I once texted,"" I miss you"" and he responds with,"" I miss you too"" (good sign, right? &gt;.&lt;).On our second date, we both discussed what we are looking for on OkCupid and ideally we both like a LTR/serious relationship and of course, just because we both agree doesn't necessarily mean that we will be in a relationship together. Joe even refers future dates such as, ""Let's go to New York together sometime"" or ""Let's watch that scary movie later"" but I can't help but feel skeptical with some of his romantic gestures. He's been treating me so sweet and makes sure I feel safe with him and is a great listener but it's either just me that is not used to it or he could be just doing these things for his own reasons. So, I don't want to waste my time that may or may not work out. I noticed he doesn't text very much and that's fine too. Some people are not texters and prefer to save convos in person and connect that way. I'm trying very hard not to correlate texting to interest but its a bit difficult given we met online. Since our third date, our texts have gone way down and I'm trying to match to his level of texts and ngl, it's a bit hard. He initiated our first date, we both agreed for second, and I asked for a third. After our third date, I asked if he was free again tomorrow night but Joe asked to hang out another time since he was tired/sore and of course, I understand. It's been a couple days since then and it may been too soon to DTR but how else can I continue to pursue interest without letting the spark die? Should I ask for a fourth date or wait for him to do so? I'm not necessarily a clingy person but I don't want to come off that way or am I looking too much into this? I'm trying not to think so much and just trying to enjoy the early stages of dating and if it doesn't work, it doesn't and I'm okay with that (I'll be a bit sad but still ok :)) If it does, that's awesome too! Any advice or suggestions are appreciated! :D"
dating_advice,Take it to the limit,"All alone at the end of the evening. I was thinking about this girl who might have loved me.  The rest of the lyrics does not matter. I (24) met this girl (24) about 5 months ago. A day after I met her, she asked me for my number. I was surprised and relieved that I did not have to put effort to ask her for her number. Then I put a lot of effort into texting her, she admired my efforts and started to hang out with me. I was taking it slow since she had bad experiences with her past relationship like she has been cheated on. She had not even been out on a date for 3 years. I dealt with similar situations and had not been in a relationship for three years, but I had been dating. 

We hung out for a few months, then she was slowly getting comfortable with me. She cuddled with me while watching movies, but she kept on saying we were just friends. I was confused, but I waited for the sign. We have seen each other's worst and learned to deal with it. 

Then two weeks ago when we came back from the break, she confessed that she had a lot of sex dream about me over the winter break. I was flattered. We had sex every day for a week, she told me she enjoyed it so much, but she wanted to stop. She felt wrong to just have sex with just a friend and prefer to have sex in a relationship. I was pretty sad for a few days and did not talk to her much. 

I decided to try and love again. I confessed my love for her last Friday and wanted to be in a relationship with her. She said she cannot see us in a relationship and I was really confused. I really do want to be with her, she seems a bit anxious about being with me. There was one time I did get pissed off by her because sometimes she said things to me that no one should ever say to anyone. As a result, I took a break from her for a few days before talking to her again. I feel like that is when she feels like I would ghost or cheated on her. 

How can I win her heart? I value so much of our conversation, truth, and trust."
dating_advice,"If someone doesn‚Äôt want anything serious rn, do you think they ever will in the near future?","Title says it all pretty much, but I (22F) started seeing someone (21M) who I went on a few dates last year and this year we decided to give it a shot again. He told me he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious rn and that‚Äôs fine with me..but the thing I‚Äôm worried about is that he will never want to be serious in the near future? Do you think this changes later on or no?"
dating_advice,Should I (25 F) reach out to him (25 M) when he's not yet over his ex?,"Basically we matched on tinder, met up twice, fooled around each time at his place. The second time, he brought up the talk about what each of us are looking for. I told him companionship &amp; looking to gain more sexual experience, and would preferably like to spend time/build a friendship with the other person outside of hooking up too. I feel this would help me to open up to the other person sexually, if I feel emotionally comfortable with him. He said he recently got out of a relationship and is still healing, and is very intentional about setting boundaries/not rushing into another relationship, but that he likes my personality, feels comfortable with me, and would also like to explore just hanging out as friends too. 

Fast forward next weekend, I hit him up and ask him if he wants to hang. He said he'd like to, but ""booked the whole weekend"". Doubt it but alright. A couple days later he texts me and says he's not feeling well, isn't in a great mood because he's thinking about his ex. I told him i'm sorry to hear that and it'll just take time (what the hell else am I supposed to say to that?). I checked in on him a bit later again and asked how he was feeling, and he said ""i'll be okay don't worry about it"". I haven't heard from him in a few days. Prior to this conversation, he texted me every day. Should I reach out and ask to meet up again, or should I give him space? I don't know if he's just really down &amp; out about his ex, or he's fucking a lot of other women from tinder so he's just too busy to fit me in (he told me he wants to keep it casual so he'll continue meeting up with others), or he's lost interest in me altogether."
dating_advice,"Why do men think that just because a girl is good-looking, she will have a string of suitable men lined up at her door?","And by suitable men I mean good, decent men. I don‚Äôt know if this is a prevalent mindset amongst men, but my super nice &amp; decent male friend today claimed to me after I lamented my being alone, that ‚Äúupinmyfeelings, you‚Äôre pretty. You will have no shortage of suitors‚Äù. 

I found this a pretty shallow statement of my friend to make. First off, it discounts all the other characteristics that would make a woman (or anyone really) a good partner, like intelligence, kindness, resourcefulness, independence. Second, a woman being good-looking can actually be a curse, as she‚Äôll attract all sorts of men, good and bad, and it can be hard/time-consuming/heart-breaking to date them all so you can see what they‚Äôre really like. 

What are your thoughts on this?"
dating_advice,Is a mutual ghosting acceptable?,"I‚Äôve (26F) been talking to this guy (29) for maybe 7ish weeks? He‚Äôs cool, cute, nice, funny, has a good career. Checks every box you‚Äôd want in a SO. First few weeks was fun and new and exciting, like it usually is. But the more we talk the more i don‚Äôt feel any really chemistry between us. Our schedules suck, we only see each other twice a month (which frankly, isn‚Äôt enough for me) so most of our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù is they text. 

We were supposed to hang out this past weekend, but i wasn‚Äôt feeling well so i cancelled. He didn‚Äôt seem bummed or upset or anything, was pretty understanding. But since then his communication has dwindled a lot. He works nights so I‚Äôm used to minimal communication during work days since he‚Äôs sleeping for most of the time I‚Äôm awake, but it‚Äôs seriously MAYBE 50 texts between us both since Saturday. Snapchats has ceased. I don‚Äôt wake up to anymore ‚Äúcute‚Äù texts like i used to. But honestly I‚Äôm not engaging much anymore either.

Now, I‚Äôm not down to ghost someone. It‚Äôs rude and hurtful and i just could never bring myself to do it. I‚Äôve explained the situation to my friends and they‚Äôve all said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre both pulling away why not just let that happen and eventually stop talking?‚Äù Which i get.. but i still feel wrong. 

We‚Äôre supposed to get lunch Friday, but he‚Äôs texted me once today and honestly there‚Äôs just no effort being out into us from either party. Should i just man up and tell this guy that it‚Äôs not working out or allow this slow mutual ghosting to happen? 

(I guess i know the answer.. i should tell him. But why out effort in for someone who isn‚Äôt reciprocating?)"
dating_advice,How come?,How come its ok for some people to want to find dates and hookups? but for people like me it isn't? I noticed whenever I talk about being unable to ever meet anyone people ridicule me and make fun of me. but when other people do it. its fine?
dating_advice,Do men sometimes dress down/act out a bit to push boundaries with women to see how much they can tolerate of them?,"As in, do men dress a bit disheveled sometimes to gauge the woman they like, if she‚Äôll accept him for it still or not? Like if she‚Äôll judge him it still like him despite it. Also wondering if this applies to men acting out a bit, like being irritable. Do they do it to push boundaries? And do men in general ever ‚Äútest‚Äù women to see how far they‚Äôll go with something? Totally just wondering about all this. Perspectives from men especially appreciated."
dating_advice,F20 he contacted me when he was drunk and said he M21 missed me.,There‚Äôs this guy that I was  talking to a few months ago and I ended things because he would always say how much he missed and wanted to see me again but made no effort to. ( he is in paramedic school but when he does have time he‚Äôs with friends). And was also still on tinder which I guess is allowed since we weren‚Äôt actually dating. I told him I can‚Äôt keep doing this with him if we weren‚Äôt going to actually see each other and told him my feelings and how he was hurting me and he basically just said he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. So a few months goes on and we still talk friendly here and there. Then this past weekend he was drunk and contacted me saying he missed me but then the next few days he acts like nothing happened. Every time we talk it makes me wish things worked out. I just don‚Äôt know what to do or think anymore because I can never get him off my mind and I can‚Äôt get rid of him completely. I just don‚Äôt know what he wants and he won‚Äôt tell me. He always says ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

dating_advice,(22F/M) Should I contact him again?,"(22F) So I dumped my f--kbuddy (22M, who told me this was a fwb, and not all about sex) of 2 months about 2 months ago cuz he would straight up ignore my texts (yes, even the important ones where I needed a response) except if it was about meeting up. This hurt me so much because there was an inconsistency between what was said and what his actual actions were, so I ended it. 

He was my first sex partner. Anyhow, now after exploring with a few other sex partners, I realized he‚Äôs one of the better guys, we had great sexual chemistry, and at this point I wouldn‚Äôt mind simply having a f--kbuddy (I think?).  The reason I‚Äôm posting this here is cuz I don‚Äôt think my friends would approve.

dating_advice,"If I hate traveling, should I just give up?","I (29M) probably won't need to tell you about the number of people who use every opportunity to tell you how adventurous they are and how they love to travel. And you probably hate it because who doesn't like to travel? Well, me.  

I honestly dislike, if not hate traveling. I don't want to go anywhere. At all. I'd have the means and time to travel every month for at least a few days, but in reality I haven't been outside of my country in over 10 years. And before that only because my parents dragged me along or for a class trip.   

I haven't traveled a single time in my entire life without someone forcing me to, and I don't intend to. It's tedious, boring, annoying, and just not fun. I'd rather stay at home and watch movies or play games for weeks on end. I don't care about seeing anything else - I can do pretty much everything I like at home or somewhere not that far away, so I can get home after.  

So, should I just accept that I will never find anyone, as everyone's life seems to be revolving around working enough, so they can afford to travel? The last thing I want is someone taking away my time off from work by making me travel to some random place I don't give a crap about. I'd rather sit around with them at home all day to be honest.     

(Throwaway acc because the girl I'm seeing knows my main.)

**TL;DR**: Traveling is boring. Everyone seems to love it. Am I doomed?"

I semi-recently became single (3 months now) and am hating it. I want my ex back so badly but I know that bridge is burned and I'm still hurting so much. I am now alone in a city that's new to me and it's taking its toll on me. I recently met a girl when I was walking my dog, complete coincidence, and now we are FWB. She definitely wants it to be more but I've set boundaries and even told her about my past. She still wants to have sex, which is great, but obviously wants more. Again, I've restated what our relationship is and maybe I'm just enabling it now. The loneliness can get a bit overwhelming.
 However, even through all this I still think about my ex and remember all our little kinks, like the way we use to kiss and cuddle. I still have her in my mind and can't shake it. I've told the (FWB) and she still comes around. I cant keep this up much longer and have to cut ties with her but I also dont want to be alone. What should I do?"
dating_advice,Me [25F] and guy [28M] talking about what we're looking for before first date. Too much?,"I \[25F\] had been talking to a guy \[28M\] from Tinder for about a week. We had planned on meeting this weekend. I asked him the other day what he was looking for in a relationship and why he downloaded Tinder. I got no response until a couple days later where he just said hey but didn't answer the question so I asked again. He said ""idk, nothing serious, but not opposed to it."" I said that I'm looking for a long term relationship. He said that's probably what's putting guys off in previous dating scenarios because I expect too much. Also, that he refused to even talk about this before the first date and ""no one would."" (However he did talk about sex and got very suggestive by like day two, basically wanted phone sex). So I said I wasn't cut out for online dating and needed time to myself to reflect on whether I should continue online dating.

Am I expecting too much? I mean, obviously Tinder isn't the best. Idk, I just expect people who are on a dating app want to date people to potentially start a relationship. Or should I go in knowing what I want?"

Since I‚Äôm an atheist, childfree, and extremely liberal it‚Äôs been a nightmare.

dating_advice,Girlfriend doesn‚Äôt want to go out anymore,"I started dating my best friend about a month ago. Before we dated, we would go out every day to do stuff (food, parks, activities, etc). It was really exciting and made me full of energy all the time.

Recently. not even a month after we started dating, she‚Äôs been wanting to stay in and not go out at all (I‚Äôll still be over at her place, but usually just doing work and stuff in each others company). 

I brought up that I missed going out like we did before, and she said that she‚Äôs been feeling kinda moody / stressed and isn‚Äôt feeling it. I know that she started using birth control right around the time we started dating and that her college classes have been extremely busy this quarter.

What should I do/say? I really miss going out, and staying in to do homework all the time kinda makes me depressed. I know there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs the birth control/stress from classes that are making her not in the mood, but how long will this last for? Is this a permanent thing?

I‚Äôm a very shy guy when it comes to women (I‚Äôm kind of a Chandler Bing), but I‚Äôm always nice to people in general. I think most of the people in the office enjoys my company.

I started to give her more attention to see if something was one and I found out it really is. We started enjoying each other‚Äôs company and start texting outside work.

The thing is I‚Äôve already asked her out two times and she always wants to reschedule to the next week. Maybe she doesn‚Äôt want me in that way but she has giving me sings and I don‚Äôt know what to do... her excuses are always lame though

Sorry for the long post, but if anyone can help me clarifying what it may be happening, I appreciate.

dating_advice,I (M 24) need help getting a girlfriend and need advice.,"I‚Äôve reached the point in my life where I need to settle down and get a girlfriend and then hopefully married! However I have never dated before or been in a relationship.

I‚Äôm looking for a specific kind of a girl to date but I‚Äôm not sure ow much or how little I should determine the importance of those things. I have been told to never settle but I feel like the ‚Äúideal‚Äù woman would be one in a billion and then there is the possibility that she doesn‚Äôt even like me lol.

Then there is the fact I suck at picking up signals from women. There was a girl in my class last quarter that I had a major crush on and I just realized a few days ago that she left me an opportunity to get to know her better but I completely blew it. I always can never tell if a girl is just being nice to me or is actually in to me. So I thought maybe online dating would be an avenue to try because there is no beating around the bush about intentions but I hate setting up profiles. I‚Äôm a very anti-picture person in the fact that I hate photos of myself. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly but I literally have 0 photos of myself and I never take pictures. Plus, I never know what to say. 

I know I‚Äôm ready for a relationship and I want to settle down but trying to balance what I want in a woman, picking up on interest from women, and putting myself out there in the dating world has become very overwhelming. I keep hoping that a beautiful woman comes and knocks on my door one day and makes me her boyfriend but that most likely won‚Äôt happen lol. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"

The title says it all. This subreddit and most advice subs are full of lies and people who aren't really struggling lying to those who are. If you think you can change my mind or offer me advice that I haven't already tried go ahead. I will defiantly try it, I don't want my opinions to be true.

BUT

Lets be real here for a brief moment.

We all know for a fact, that looks, and status and money are more important to a relationship than personality is. This is a fact. No ifs, no ands, no buts. It is the way it is. This isn't theory. This is fact, looks open the door for a relationship, looks make you more important and looks 100% define if you will be successful in a relationship at all. Don't lie and say this isn't the case. IT IS THE CASE.

Let me tell you some personal experinces ive had with women, im incel, have and will always be incel. I didn't put that label on myself. YOU GUYS DID. I didn't even know what an incel was before reddit hounded me for being one. The existence of incels should tell you something is up. I didn't wake up one day with bad ideas about women and men. Nah, they developed very slowly and methodically as I grew up.

As a kid I was always bullied, by both men and women. Women would make fun of me, hard. I remember on a bus to a field trip, no seats were open, so I sat next to a girl, and said ""hey whats up?"" she looks at me in disgust.... "" WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!"" I looked at her in shock, ""uhm‚Ä¶ you?"" I replied... she gets up and storms out of the seat, and sits next to two other girls. I looked at them and my eyes started to tear up... I said ""what did I do?"" her attractive blond friend looked at me and said ""SHUT THE FUCK UP.... NO ONE LIKES YOU!!!""

I literally teared up writing this, and everytime I bring stories of how women have treated me up, you guys say im a liar. This is the cold hard truth of how it is for guys like me.

throughout school I never, never got the chance to date or have friends. So don't sit and call me entitled, this has nothing to do with entitlement. Its called being a good person and treating me like a human. They watched me cry man. but guess what? I think they felt bad about it cause once I got to high school people did actually start treating me better, even those mean girls, they started saying hi to me in the halls and stuff. I think they honestly felt bad for how they treated me in middle school. but anyway I ended up getting into drugs and all that and made some ""friends"" these friends would constantly CONSTANTLY, hound on me for being a virgin, my nickname was retardo, 40 year old virgin, cause ig I look old for my age and ""extra duhhh"" cause im that slow these friends would only hang out with me when I had money, so id steal and rob to have extra cash so I wouldn't be so alone and could afford to do drugs with my ""friends""

When id call them, theyd put the phone on speaker when they were having sex with girls they met, and than id hang up and get a text later saying ""that's a sound you will never hear"" id cry. but that's how it is for guys like me.

I decided id become a drug dealer, thatll show everyone! ill have money, girls will like me, they'll see!

I got a job at mcdonalds and saved up for my first ounce of weed, and started selling it for ridiculously low prices, to get clientele, ppl were finally texting me! ppl were finally calling me! girls were actually talking to me! wow! I started moving up to half pounds and pills and everything I could sell, it was so fun. but.... they were all just using me. I never kissed any of those girls nor did they have sex with me or go on dates with me. I was alone as always got kicked out of school twice went to prison twice.

and at 18 went to prison for years....

in prison my awkwardness my shyness my small frame, I got bullied by the other men so bad, theyd make fun of my virginty to, you know how it is? You meet older guys and they ask ""u know any girls? huh? u getting girls?""

all I can do is say... ""uhhh no?...""

HAHAHAHAHA VIRGIN HAHAHHA

I got out of prison at 20 years old, and deep down I did hate women to the core. I mean are you guys going to sit here and deny how they treated me? Fuck you for that before u even comment. and anything suggesting im a liar ill just ignore.

Now as an isolated child I did get good at one thing, technology, I was obsessed with computers and everything else, SO, I actually made an improvement when I got out of prison. cause I mean, I used to hack girls I like in high school, on some script kiddie shit. Taught myself how to code with books and youtube. I said imma go to college for information security. im going to change my life! I may not be strong and tall and brave like other guys, but from a computer I can do good in the world and stop cyber crime. Redemption.

girls aren't really into computers but I mean I got a job to and actually started working on my social anxiety, of course when I meet girls, all I know about besides drugs is computers. So I will talk about computers and technology to them. They just cringe and walk away. Even girls that are in IT seem to not really like it and be doing It for money. I do it cause I love it. but meh anyway, I finally did actually make some friends with girls. friends, I use that term VERY loosely. I also accidentally asked out a lesbian and she said no. and yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

These friends who are girls, love to use me.

They ignore all my texts, ignore me and treat me like shit in real life. and also love to ask for money. Im not being a sexist, this is personal experience. This is real life. This is what happened to me. IM TRYING NOT TO GENERALIZE. but wow am I an unlucky guy? or is that normal?

well 2 of these girls said that I should make a tinder, and I told them... I already have one, and nobody matchs with me.

&amp;#x200B;

they said ok, lets make you one than, took pics all that. still no matchs, and also these girls constantly ignore me, and belittle me at times, they seem to almost rub their sex lives in my face? saying things like ""when im horny, I just find some hot guys online and fuck them sometimes?"" Ok. its not that easy for me. and im the entitled one? because you guys reading this esspeccially if your a woman ur first thing is ""longnightofsolace is entitled incel‚Ä¶"" nah man, just give me a chance here.

&amp;#x200B;

They tell me how easy it is to meet guys and stuff, and im just sitting there telling them, ""its not that easy for guys like me."" they even used my accounts and tried to get me dates and never never never did I ever get one.

also when I ask to hang out, they ask if im gonna bring weed etc. if I don't. they don't wanna chill. they'll leave me on read and tell me they are busy, than put pics with boys on their social media and just tell me they have a social life to attend to. to bad I cant be part of that. must be all my entitlement. you know? the whole incels are entitled bullshit is well, bullshit. Sure some incels seem entitled like women are supposed to worship them or something? but all I want is a chance man, and that seems impossible, or to at least be treated with respect which seems impossible as well.

I eventually met this really attractive girl at work, she moved here from out of state, and she loves weed. and asked me to get her some, she was also my first kiss.

she also ignores the fuck out of me constantly, treats me like dog shit, calls me names at times, rolls her eyes at me and yeah, just horrible how she treats me. shes really really attractive, and knows im a incel and I think she thinks its fun to hurt me tbh. she told me how she meets all kinds of guys to fuck online and one night stands them. (im the entitled one, reddit. I am. cause I just want a chance, that makes me entitled, LOLOLOLOLOLOL) she complained to me one time because she went 2 weeks with out sex.

I told her, ""you know I never ever had sex, probably never will, yet it seems so easy for you, what if I started complaining about being a virgin, thatd be gross though wouldn't it? but I notice a girl complains about not getting dick and everyone just thinks that's ok.""

she kinda ignored me for a bit after that.

(again im the entitled one, fuck you reddit.)

Than she started being weirdly flirty with me all the time. I NEVER, had a girl flirt with me, especially one this attractive, I have seen guys harass this girl, guys way hotter than me. and she rejects them? but she like told me she found me attractive and started treating me really nice and than one day she kissed me on the cheek.

that's it. just a kiss on the cheek.

that was my first kiss, cheek counts right? well now she kinda just ignores me and doesn't even talk to me at all. idk why she did that at all and probably never will. she messages me here and there telling me she ""loves me"" but I mean obviously not cause when im going through it im left on read in this bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume when she needs something from me ill get a text. that's that ig.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its my looks holding me back guys. ive posted on amiugly before and all it is was ppl saying im the ugliest man alive. That they can ""see the depression in my eyes""

I look in the mirror and I cry guys.

if your in a position like me. there is really no fucking hope.

ive seen it all first hand, girls blowing me off for way hotter guys. ITS ALL IN THE LOOKS.

If your attractive man you have it way easy, esspeccially if your a girl. if your ugly, in 2020, thats virginity dude. for life.

if u want to offer advice id be glad to hear it, Im pretty depressed right now. but don't call me entitled, don't sit here and lie to me and tell me I need to ""get over it"" if you were in my shoes youd feel the same way about it. its bullshit when someone whos had sex, and gets to have it when they desire, can tell someone to just get over it. When girls are telling me, ""I get horny, I meet up guys and fuck"" do I have to show u the messages?

Its bullshit when they can say that shit, than judge me when I just wish I could get a date. that one kiss was so amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

but im to ugly for all that.

&amp;#x200B;

that was my whole point btw, if your ugly like me, it really is over it seems like. and the rest of the world feels the same way, they'll tell ya, ""GET OVER IT."" while they go through 5 boyfriends / girlfriends a year and countless hook ups."

dating_advice,Why do I (26M) attract women of the same type?,"Hi Reddit.  
I've been on the dating scene for seven years. Initially, it wasn't really that good, but as my resources grew, so did the pool of girls who showed some interest in me. Not surprisingly, I ended up making some mistakes that could have been avoided. Anyway, I learnt from them.

What seems to have transpired on me right now is that I attract women exhibiting pretty much the same traits. Narcissism, psychopathy (excessive body modifications are a surefire way of telling whether one has such traits or not), lack of ability to empathize (who would've thought). And the consequences these kinds of behaviour bring with them.

Now I make a conscious effort to steer clear of such women. I dodged many a bullet in the past, and I am not intent on repeating the same stupid mistake again. That said, I do not resort to sweeping generalizations. I know that women are different; I happen to have known some outstanding women (it didn't pan out well due to there having been too much difference life/age-wise between us).

Perhaps. I need to change myself and my way of thinking, yet I don't really know how this change can be brought about.

Still, it makes me wonder why it is exactly this type of women that go after me."

dating_advice,"To message or not to message, help!","So I met this person on a dating app 2 months ago and we spoke everyday up until a few weeks before the new year where they left me on read. I took initiative and messaged them despite having a slight feeling that they probably lost interest but at the time I was thinking whatever, there‚Äôs nothing to lose so might as well. They replied with the usual ‚Äòsorry I‚Äôve been busy...‚Äù which to me is a lame excuse because they told me previously that they were seeing someone else and I know that they was pretty free at this time because they told me before. Despite this we did have a small conversation (not great like what we had before) and then they left me on read AGAIN. Bearing in mind, they were always the first to initiate conversations previously. At this point I was sick of it and just wanted to move on to the next person but the new year festivities got the best of me and I ended up drunk messaging them saying happy new year to which they did respond saying the same back. 

My dilemma at the moment is that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about them and all the great conversations we had. I have the urge to message them again just to ask how they are even though I know that the chance of them being clearly not interested is high and maybe they‚Äôre just being nice so responds to my messages. I know it may come off as a bit desperate but I‚Äôm someone that needs closure and maybe messaging them this one last time might provide me with it. If they reply and it‚Äôs a dry response or if they don‚Äôt reply at all, that will be their answer to my dilemma. Do you guys think I should do it? Any other opinions will be greatly appreciated."
dating_advice,"I feel broken, please help","Okay this is gonna be a long one and I honestly dont know where else to ask for this sort of help.

I'm a 16 year old Male and I've been in a relationship with my current girlfriend for over 8 months. Shes the first person I've ever loved and I'm the first person shes ever loved. Our relationship is highly sexual and we've had sex, we started off as FWB and then started dating and feel in love and no longer are just sexual.
All she has ever wanted is a long lasting stable relationship, we've both planned our futures together and have even named our future kids.

Even though we was extremely in love I can be very toxic at times and emotionally hurt her, it's not too bad and it's never physical and I'm going to therapy to help stop it. But I hate myself so much for doing this to her. Its definitely doesnt outrank all the good times and it's not as often, but it happens and I cant control it sadly.

Okay now onto the main problem in facing.
I have a very close friendship group where its primarily girls, we all connect and support each other, hug when in bad moods, hang out whenever we can and need each other. I've been friends with them since I met my girlfriend and nothings ever happened, but recently I've started to feel trapped in my relationship and ice started thinking about hooking up with my friends.

I used to have these thoughts once a week to now every single day atleast 8 times. It's actually fucking with my head so much and we've had breaks but I still feel so trapped, like I've got no freedom and no free will. My girlfriend is the only girl ive ever touched and I honestly dont think I can go all my life staying like that (it's a guy thing i think).

I'm starting to think that I'm just not ready for a real relationship, I just wanna go back to FWB with a girl and not feel so trapped and stressed like I do now. (I feel being single is such a privilege now). I mean like I'm only just 16, school is stressful as fuck, I've lost many friendships cause being too busy with my girlfriend, I never have  the time off my phone to do something I like but never do cause I'm glued to messaged her (I love writing, reading and drawing but haven't had the time in so long). Its not that shes controlling and wont let me have my time, it's just that I'm actually so unable to give myself the time cause I'm always thinking about her. 

Theres 4 girls in the friendship group... E, A, and S who are on my mind.

E is so fucking nice and coming out of two really rough breakups atm and we are really good friends who look out and support each other. I dont think of her as much as the other girls and we dont have much of a sexual chemistry between us. I've told her how I feel about all this and I cant shake the feeling that she wishes shit between us was more sexual. But I dont know of course.

A us my best fucking friend, we tell each other everything, we laugh, we argue and we flirt like hell at times (at this point I dont even realise when I flirt until later) we rely on each other so much, we cant live without each other and are do happy when together. We have such high sexual chemistry together aswell (therefore the flirting).
She is also going through a rough breakup with a boy who I catfished to find out he cheated on her and she confronted him with enough proof to find out hes a cheat and they broke up. They argue a shit ton but are still in love and have done stuff they shouldn't of after the breakup. 
A recently told me if I was single and if she was in a better place she would be fine with becoming FWB

S I've been friends with longer than A and we fucking love hanging out and are really close, but still not as close as me and A. I used to have a massive crush on S and was rejected alot but now shit is different, we both have had sex, fucked about a shit ton and are different people. Shes got a FWB atm who likes her but she doesnt know, so even though S and me have the best sexual chemistry in all of the friendship group and she is completely willing to flirt with me and turn me on whenever, I dont wanna do that to her FWB who is my mate.

So yeah.... shits fucked.

I know I'm not ready for a relationship and theres a chance if me and my girlfriend do break up, we wont get back together and I could completely change a friendship forever and lose my true love. I feel I cant stay in this relationship unhappy when I havent even tested what I want right now, uve never had the chance to fuck around with other girls and I feel that will relieve all this stress and make me feel free again.
I truly dont know what I want right now.
And I feel if I dont do something soon, I may end up cheating later and I fucking cant live with myself if I do that.

Also I've spoken to my girlfriend about this today and we nearly broke up, she knows all of this and we are both trying to come up with an option we can take, but at this point it seems like if I do hook up with a girl we wont be dating again (atleast for many many years I think).

I feel so broken in myself, please help."
dating_advice,Being ‚ÄúA Man‚Äù vs. Just Being ‚ÄúPlain Attractive‚Äù,"Throughout my four years of college, where I had a lot of relationship experiences, and observed a lot of others, I went through a phase where I started to really take maturing and becoming a grown-up man very seriously. At this time, I didn‚Äôt give a crap about grooming, I would shave my head a lot and grow out a beard, really not attractive at all for me. At this time though, I did portray a very ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù aura, but my relationship experiences were just horrible. I had some really bad experiences, I felt like if I was with a girl I was never completely attracted to them (why even bother right, idk horny I guess) and I got heartbroken by the one girl I really liked when we broke up. Fast forward to after the heartbreak, and I started to take another approach. Instead of focusing on maturing, I started to really maximize my looks. I bought some really good-looking clothing, I would shave everyday (Braun razor, so quick 3 min shave daily), and started growing my hair out long and styling it. I completely ditched caring about ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù and kinda let me dickish, joking persona show (pretty immature behaviors). My experiences completely flipped. I felt like many many more women were comfortable and attracted to me, and let‚Äôs just say the next steps have changed as well.  And here‚Äôs where I want a sharing of experiences, male or female. Seriously, being a good man and having a personality matters, but I‚Äôm really starting to feel self-improvement is complete bullshit. Like, I‚Äôm becoming extremely aware that being attractive is 85% of what gets you there, then you have to not fuck it up. Pretty much, don‚Äôt be a horrible person, and even then if you‚Äôre hot enough she won‚Äôt care. As a supplement, I‚Äôve noticed it in other men that many of them can be straight up awkward, not able to hold up a conversation, or just be straight dicks, and it‚Äôs all erroneous/irrelevant. Men and women of reddit, what‚Äôs your experiences"
dating_advice,How long should you wait to ask out a girl in your class?,"There's a girl I just started talking to this week. Earlier this week we had a 20 minute conversation before class and I found that we have a lot in common. Today she came and sat next to me, we smiled and talked a bit more then I asked her for her number for homework help. 


I wanted to build up a basic friendship at the very least but I'm mindful not to wait too long and to risk getting friendzoned. I think so far I could consider myself friends with her. Is a week of waiting enough? I know some girls get weirded out if guys rush it."
dating_advice,Is this true?,"Recently I‚Äôve been told my multiple ladies that to have a successful relationship, the man would need to love the woman more... really makes me think about my past relationships and why they failed. Could this be the reason why?"
dating_advice,My (18M) gf (17F) still snapchats her ex and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it,"My girlfriend of around a year used to date a guy long distance. They dated for a while and had strong feelings for each other before they broke up, and I‚Äôm still not too clear why. They still have a streak and snapchat regularly. I‚Äôm not too sure how to feel about it. I want to respect her and allow to be friends with who she wants, but at the same time I‚Äôm not 100% comfortable about it. She‚Äôs told they‚Äôre just friends and I believe her, but it still makes me uneasy at times. 

To make things a little more complicated, when I first found out that she dated some guy long distance, I didn‚Äôt really care and she made me promise it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem down the road, which I figured it wouldn‚Äôt, cause why would it? But that was before I learned that they still talk and Snapchat each other.

Should I bring it up to her and see what she has to say about it? I don‚Äôt want to offend her or be too controlling. I also don‚Äôt want to break my promise, but like I said it makes me uneasy at times."
dating_advice,Everything and more.,"I don‚Äôt know whether to continue just letting myself feel this in hopes it‚Äôll fade away or to act on the need to try and reconnect and just show that I‚Äôm willing to make it work... 

It was only a few months but it felt like I‚Äôd always been doing it and I just don‚Äôt want to give it up so easily..

Why is this shit so hard?"
dating_advice,How to enter the pool without apps but with an intense job and should I even try like this?,"TL;DR: I adamantly refuse to use dating apps. But I also have a job that burns all of my time and energy, and honestly gave me behavioral health issues because of overworking and stress. How can I meet people NOT at work or on these apps/should I even, considering I have these issues? How do I build the skills without being a creep?

Regular: 

I work about as much as a surgeon and get paid about as much as a Pizza Hutt manager (army enlisted cyber Intel in support of an intelligence agency). Luckily my financial future looks epic for it (already got a $115k job offer to do my exact job at my exact desk as a contractor once I get out). A lot of work and promise for a 26 year old guy with no degree lol. 

Problem is that left me with a bunch of issues. Diagnosed depression, anxiety, eating disorder, you name it. I see a counselor and am on treatments. None of it intense. But the big issue is I suffer from anhedonia because of it (lack of enjoyment from things that used to/should bring you happiness). Basically I haven‚Äôt had an actual happy feeling in years. And it concerns me, going into a relationship with this much active baggage. 

I feel a big reason is too little social engagement and too much work. I rarely work less than 60 hours a week, and that‚Äôs not counting my online college classes or month long army courses. 

I usually find myself more stable with a partner, and have started having that feeling that I need/want one (usually happens after a few years- it‚Äôs like a cycle with me, relationship for six months, single for three years, get that feeling, repeat). 

I‚Äôm looking for a life partner honestly. I don‚Äôt care to sleep around (and won‚Äôt, because catholic) but I refuse to do things like go to church JUST to try and find someone. But I‚Äôm not getting any younger. 

But four big issues:

1 I have VERY little time to play with. 

2 I do NOT do social media or dating apps. 

3 I am quite a bit too rational/pragmatic/assholic/structurally minded for most people to find interesting or engaging. 

4 Completely socially inept. I don‚Äôt really feel I‚Äôve ever been ‚Äúin the dating pool‚Äù. Hell I‚Äôve had more incidental relationships than people I‚Äôve actually asked out. My dry, dark, and self deprecating sense of humor and the apparent fact that people can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm smiling unless it‚Äôs a big smile also mess with people. 

So what I‚Äôm asking:

1 Is it wrong to enter the dating pool for these reasons or with these issues? Isn‚Äôt it kind of catfishing to do the whole social media dating app thing with all of this in the background? 

2 Since I‚Äôm so paranoid online (and fairly religious, so sex is ok but flings are not) what is a good way to meet women in the ~25+ age bracket that ISNT Tinder or these apps? MUCH preferably offline. Online is too fake, it‚Äôs gross. Most seem to be married or careerists anyways. 

3 That being said, cold approaching women in the street or at book shops is just creepy. 

4 How to adjust socially. I don‚Äôt have a fashion sense or the ability to hold small talk (in a way most people can). I barely even see people my own age, most are far younger, far older, or already in committed relationships/married. And fashion, it‚Äôs like a primate dancing to attract a mate (‚Äúwait for it and... BOOM. See, I have nice shoes and a crazy hairstyle. I must be worthy of bearing offspring, no?‚Äù) Are there resources to more or less get up to speed on this crap, or ways to help women see BEYOND the fact that I‚Äôm wearing comfortable running shoes to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory?"
dating_advice,Should I wait on dating until after I get help?,"I‚Äôm a high schooler who has never dated before, and a guy in one of my classes is showing interest in me. I kind of started liking him too because I‚Äôm not used to getting that kind of attention, but I‚Äôve been ignoring him partly because I‚Äôm shy but also because I think I may have developed a mental health problem that makes me extremely socially anxious and scared to go out to crowded places, to the point that I self harm and isolate myself to cope. Should I try to get over the crush and first help myself? I already have a doctor‚Äôs appointment scheduled in March, but I think by that point it will be too late to start a relationship as I‚Äôll be graduating soon."
dating_advice,(25/F) too afraid to approach men,"Unless I‚Äôm 1,000% sure he might have feelings for me already, but the catch is I always think nobody likes me. 

I‚Äôve only successfully dated one man so far in life. 

I hate rejection so much, my mind can‚Äôt take it. I have depression and anxiety, and I‚Äôm highly sensitive. Rejection can affect me for months/years depending on the person and how it was done. 

I also feel like a hideous monster all the time, so I‚Äôm afraid any guy I approach would think I‚Äôm some freak.  People tell me I‚Äôm attractive, but I can‚Äôt see it, so it‚Äôs irrelevant. All I see are my flaws, and everything that‚Äôs wrong with me. I don‚Äôt like myself, and I KNOW that‚Äôs bad. 

I saw a handsome guy the other day, but there was a girl in the same vicinity that I thought I was prettier, so I didn‚Äôt even bother.  Handsome guys make me feel ugly too-like I‚Äôm not even human. I‚Äôm intimidated. 

Men DO like me. They give me googoo eyes and all, but I‚Äôm so afraid to be vulnerable. I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll see me how I see myself. 

I can barely fathom how I ever managed to get at least 1 boyfriend.  I still get very shy and quiet around men, especially ones I‚Äôm attracted to. 

I know men want women to make the first move more, but it‚Äôs hard when you little self esteem and barely any confidence. It‚Äôs tough for me. 

I‚Äôm so lonely, I wish I had someone I could care about again."

dating_advice,Guy [20] unmatched me [F21] after moving our conversation from tinder to snapchat,"I matched with a guy a couple days ago, and we really hit it off. We decided to move to snapchat for more reliable notifications and to exchange pet photos. Today, I opened tinder to check a message from someone else and noticed that he'd unmatched me. He hasn't removed me from snapchat (nor has he opened my messages today).

Has this happened to anyone else? Is it normal tinder etiquette? A glitch? Or should I take it as an indication that he's not interested?

Thanks!"
dating_advice,He likes me? He likes me not?,"Hello everyone! Just looking for a different point of view. I work at a restaurant where there are many museums. We have a a regular. He goes 3/4 times a week. He calls in his order and picks it up. I‚Äôve been working at this place for a year and a half and I always found him attractive but never put attention to him and never gave him attention like my other coworkers that drop everything to help him when he arrives. From a couple months ago when we bumped into each other through out the park he always says hi,even though I heard from other people that he‚Äôs ‚Äúa little arrogant‚Äù  we never made conversation until a couple months ago i played dumb and asked him about an event at his museum and asked if there were any tickets available he said he could find out for me and he left and went outside to call the museum for information. After this, this is how we slowly kind of started talking. 

I somehow feel in my gut he does maybe like me back since it‚Äôs hard to describe the way he looks at me.  On one occasion I was in the register ringing him up and I had a glitter nail polish and he mumbled something and I asked what he said. And he‚Äôs like ‚Äúthat reminds me of sugar cookies‚Äù and I‚Äôm like what? And he said your nail polish. And he started making a simulation as if he was sprinkling sugar. Also everyone always lets him insert the credit card to our tablet as I would always just grab it from him (since I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing) and I started noticing every time I would charge him he would open his wallet and slow motion and did a funny noise and handed the card to me in slow motion. Then I noticed he only did that with me and with other people he would just insert the card. As into yesterday again he mumbled something and he gave me a compliment on my bracelet. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a nice bracelet‚Äù I kind of always notice he looks at my hands. If I wasn‚Äôt at work I would‚Äôve already asked him out for a drink but I don‚Äôt want to come out unprofessional and also I want to make sure he‚Äôs on the same page as me.

dating_advice,I (24F) need advice on dating someone (26M) who is depressed and won't communicate,"I've been dating this really awesome guy for a few months (starting July) - he was really upfront about having depression and anxiety and has had therapy and medication about a year before I met him, but stopped with both since he was in a better place at the time.

A couple months after dating, some symptoms for an upcoming depressive episode started showing. He replied less, was less affectionate with me, wanted to sleep all day, didn't want to go out anymore, etc. It was terribly difficult for me to know if my messages were helpful/nice or just annoying, because he didn't reply most of the time, but we still managed to hang out once a week.

Then a few weeks ago, there was a death in his family which just made him plummet to a really deep depression. When this happened, I wasn't in town so the best I could do was be there for him through messages. Because of this tragic event, he went back to therapy and is back on medication. 

After not being in town for 3 weeks, I asked when he'd be free so that we could see each other since it's been so long. I've previously mentioned that I'm all for laying around and just watching a movie. He's mentioned that ""he doesn't want to pretend like he's okay"" and I told him he doesn't have to pretend with me, he can cry all day and I just didn't want him to be alone, to which he responded ""I need to be alone."" I'm never trying to ""cure"" him, I really just want to support him. I'm in no place to tell someone how to live their life, I just want to be in each other's company the way we always used to be.

On the last day I talked to him, he had just hung out with one of his oldest friends. So in my mind i thought, ""Cool, he's capable of leaving the house for something that's not work."" So I asked him if he'd be free sometime, to which he again replied ""I'm sorry I just need to be alone right now."" I told him ""Okay, I feel like I haven't respected your request to leave you alone, I'm going to do that now. Please reach out when you're ready to talk or hang."" And he just responded, ""Will do.""

It's been a week. And he posted on his social media that he went to a soccer game, which is something that he loves so it made me happy that he's out doing that, but kind of sad that he still hasn't been able to message me, especially since we've talked every single day when we first met. I'm just confused if I should message him again to let him know I still care about him. Or did I just get dumped over message without realizing? My mind is honestly all over the place. 

I have a great support of system of friends which helps me take my mind off this whole thing, but I haven't talked to any of them about this because I don't want them to know his personal business. So here I am asking for advice from strangers lol. Any advice would help, thank you!"

dating_advice,"If I [25F] stopped reaching out to him [30M], am I ghosting him or just waiting for him to initiate?","Didn't realize how long this would get! tl:dr at the end.

I \[25F\] have been seeing this guy \[30M\] long distance for \~6 months (same state, different cities). We've been able to see each other in person about 6-7 times during this period. We haven't explicitly stated that we're exclusive and although I still have my profile up on dating apps, I'm just not interested in going on dates with other men.

At the beginning, he used to reach out to me all the time, text all day, videochatting, etc. Naturally, this began to slow down and I began to initiate everyday; we now tend to have ""rolling"" conversations where we get back to each other when we can. I've asked him a couple of times if he's bothered or annoyed that I reach out, and he says no. I've told him he's never a bother if he reaches out/I'd like for him to initiate more. He acknowledges this, but hasn't acted on it (I have given him a chance to initiate a few times, but get impatient after a few days and reach out because I don't like playing the waiting game).

Lately he's been making it seem as if I'm being unreasonable with asking to videochat because he's ""been so busy."" He started a new job with a new company a little over a month ago, so I do understand that he's busy and overwhelmed with everything. However, he's never offered an alternative day, it's just ""we'll see."" I haven't been pushy, I've been supportive and told him I'm here for him if he needs anything.

I have no problem texting the guy I like first just as long as it feels equal. But now it's starting to feel like a chore. I'm tired of initiating the conversations. A few days ago we were having one which didn't require a response from my end, so I didn't reply (he's done this plenty of times). Normally I would've reached out by now, but I just don't want to, in part because I feel I'm more interested in this guy than he is in me. I'm still doing things I like to do so I'm not fixating on this, but I still feel a little bad that I haven't reached out to him or given him an explanation as to why I've been quiet. My ex stopped talking to me for a week before breaking up with me, so I know what it feels like but I'm just not sure where to go from here? Should I reach out one more time or just cut my losses and move on?

**tl;dr Long distance with guy for \~6mos, lately I've always been initiating conversations. He doesn't initiate and says he's too busy to videochat, so I stopped reaching out after our last conversation. Am I more interested in him than the other way around? Am I ghosting or just waiting for him to initiate?**"

TLDR: 

Kind of awkward guy going on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù tommorow with another socially awkward classmate. What should we talk about? Any advice? Should I text her right now asking if shes free tommorow or just ask her tommorow?


Long version: 

I‚Äôm a socially awkward 21 year old accounting major who‚Äôs planning on asking my classmate if she‚Äôd like to go to lunch. (First time I‚Äôve done so in a while)

The issue is, I‚Äôve known her since October. It‚Äôs December now and there hasn‚Äôt really been much progress and tbh we‚Äôre both kind of socially awkward and our conversations just stall. She gives bland answers and idk what else to say. 

I don‚Äôt know anything about her so we don‚Äôt really have anything to talk about except school. Even if she texts first (about homework), she gives bland responses. 

Can anyone‚Äôs give me some conversation tips or starters for people who are both socially awkward? 

Also, there‚Äôs the issue of time. We have two classes together. A 10am-12pm and a 1:30-3:30. Should I suggest to study together for the quiz after 12 and eat after the 3:30? Or the other way around?

Or should I just text her right now asking her if she‚Äôs busy tommorow?"

The weekend came and I didn‚Äôt hear much from her. Sunday was more talkative. The last 2 nights she hasn‚Äôt told me goodnight and she read but did not respond to the last 2 messages I had sent. She messaged me good evening tonight and I asked how it was going. She replied alright and that was it. Am I doing something wrong?
dating_advice,Matched with a girl I know on Tinder,"We aren't friends or anything, but I recognized her because she works at a business I shop at pretty regularly. My problem is, she hasn't responded to the message I sent 2 days ago when we matched. Should I send her another message and just leave it? I really hate to be that guy and hit her up at work"
dating_advice,The guy [24M] who ghosted me [20F] messaged me,"Before I start, this is going to sound very trivial and I‚Äôm likely reading way too much into the situation/person. 

I posted a question a few days ago about the situation when he first ghosted me ( found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/eulny4/i_20f_got_ghosted_by_a_dude_24m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ); however, when he messaged me, it was in response to my snapchat story. Apparently I had my settings to where everyone could see my story and not just my friends, so that‚Äôs why he was able to respond. My story was basically a recording of me walking and responding to something happening at that moment, was shot at an unfortunate angle. I‚Äôm talking under the chin, my head looking straight ahead bad angle, because I assumed only my friends could see my story. Learned my lesson. 

Anyways, before he ghosted we‚Äôd been talking through snapchat and sharing pictures and whatnot. He knows what I look like and knows that I was not catfishing him. His response to my story was, verbatim, ‚Äúhow do you look so different üòÇ‚Äù , emoji and all. 

At this point, I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs joking or not, but I took slight offense towards it. Do you think that he was joking around or was that an underhanded insult?"
dating_advice,Are feminine-looking things in the home of a man often a sign he has a girlfriend or wife?,"I‚Äôve been talking with a guy for about 8 months now (it‚Äôs a LDR). He‚Äôs not overly macho but definitely is to some extent and comes from a place in which men are masculine and women feminine, though women are more equal and expected to work outside the home.

Anyway, I‚Äôve noticed feminine-looking bedsheets and pillows and even a tablecloth in the background of photos he sends me. Part of me fears this is evidence of a spouse or girlfriend he‚Äôs hiding that he wasn‚Äôt smart enough to crop out but another part hopes it‚Äôs just stuff he likes or his mother gave him and he doesn‚Äôt care what it looks like and uses it anyway.

I tend to overanalyze, so maybe that is what I‚Äôm doing here. I sure hope so."
dating_advice,Is he not interested anymore?,"Hi, I need some advice....I‚Äôve been talking to a man who is a resident physician for about 2 months. We actually haven‚Äôt had much time to see each other ( we went out twice, we both traveled out of town over the holidays), and the day that he got back into town we did see each other, but then he had to start a month straight of working on call. Since he started it, he‚Äôs been really distant and I‚Äôve been doing most of the initiation with communicating. When we do talk, he answers me right away and he‚Äôs always asking about me and my life, and my day. I‚Äôve tried asking him about work, but I can tell he doesn‚Äôt want to discuss it at all. We aren‚Äôt together, so I don‚Äôt expect him to treat me like a GF, but I would like an opportunity to spend more time with him at some point. I haven‚Äôt said anything to him because I don‚Äôt want to bother him when he‚Äôs already stressing and focused on work. I have so much respect and I admire what he‚Äôs doing, I‚Äôm not upset or take anything personally. I‚Äôm just confused and I want to understand what he‚Äôs dealing with a bit better, but I know trying to talk to him about it right now isn‚Äôt considerate to him."

dating_advice,How can I spice up this conversation?,"To clarify we are both college freshmen. I‚Äôm taking a semester off due to moving. He is an athlete for our states biggest team in his sport, and I well... work in a tanning salon. So I left him on read because he just didn‚Äôt seem that interested in me. Or so I thought.

He searched me on Instagram two weeks after we stopped talking and liked a few of my photos, we have no mutuals so he had to have manually done so. He texted me when I followed back, but right off the bat our conversations are really dry.

How can I spice this up? I really would like to get to know him, as there‚Äôs a strong physical attraction, but it‚Äôs hard to keep the conversation going when he asks ‚Äòwyd‚Äô 5 times a day."
dating_advice,Asking out a newly single friend for Valentines Day,"Hey guys.

I (28m) met this girl (22f) at work about 6 months ago. We hit it off during shifts and I developed a little bit of a crush on her, but she had a long term boyfriend so I didn't make any sort of move aside from the odd flirty comment here and there.

Fast forward to earlier this month, we're no longer coworkers but met up for a catch up, where I found out she was now very recently single (about 2 weeks). After taking a few days to consider things I texted asking if she'd like to go on a date sometime. She responded saying that while she enjoyed hanging out with me she wasn't ready to jump straight back into dating following just getting out of a long term relationship, and that she'd like to continue doing what we are doing and see where it leads over time. 

That was about 2 weeks ago, we've texted every day since, had some flirty back and forth and went out for a drink a few days ago, we also went back to her place and watched a film on her bed together but nothing happened... Before I'd got home from that I had a message from her saying how much she enjoyed hanging out that day. We now also have plans to go out again this weekend and plans to go to a show together a month from now. 

I personally get the vibe that she is interested in me but I'm hesitant to make a move again so soon after her telling me she wasn't ready to jump straight back into the dating scene. 

However with valentines day approaching I thought it would maybe be a good opportunity to broach the subject when I next see her in person... What do you guys think? Should I just not say anything and let her bring it up at her own pace, or am I still expected to make the first move again?

Thanks for any advice, like her a lot and don't wanna potentially mess something up by moving too soon!"

dating_advice,Could use a little help,"[19M, NYC] My dating life has been ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for awhile now. I try not to focus too much on finding a significant other but I‚Äôm also tired of acting like it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm a quiet person (I don‚Äôt consider myself introverted, I‚Äôm just a little shy), I don‚Äôt leave my house much unless it‚Äôs to go to work, to grab something to eat, or to go to the gym, and I don‚Äôt have many friends (by choice). I feel like I take great care of myself; I‚Äôm an active person, I keep up with my hygiene and mental wellbeing. I‚Äôm overall happy with myself, but the dating scene for me is borderline nonexistent. I tried Tinder for a few months and had no luck, although wasn‚Äôt expecting much anyway. I‚Äôm also not in college yet. Anybody have any suggestions, I‚Äôm tired of being lonely lmao"
dating_advice,"Going through divorce, found a FWB. She caught feelings. She still willing to go on, should I?","Kind of a sticky situation. I am going through a divorce and it‚Äôs been pretty hard emotionally. A girl from work reached out and we hit it off pretty great and both knowing it was just fun and a FWB kind of thing. The sex was amazing and I felt more wanted and desired in 2 weeks than I had with my STBXW over 14 years. But after 2 weeks I could tell she had feelings and I tried to re-establish boundaries. She said we could continue just having fun, but then she told me she loved me.

I took a week off and then talked to her and told her it had to stop. She took it pretty hard and was hurt, and then a week later I talked to her again because I could tell she didn‚Äôt take it well and I still have to work with her. That time seemed better. I told her I couldn‚Äôt keep hurting her and while she wanted to ‚Äújust keep having fun‚Äù I told her if we did that it would just hurt more later and that I couldn‚Äôt do that.

Since then, we have been talking still. She usually initiates conversations and while they are often innocuous, she does make a lot of flirty innuendo type comments. Not like before I ended things, but they are still there. Every day she texts me and asks what‚Äôs up. She checks on me which feels nice. She went through divorce where she (like me) was cheated on and has been a support for me through that. But I also find myself not wanting to be tied down again and feeling like I need to check in with someone every day. 

Furthermore, I still have a desire to feel wanted and to continue the FWB thing, it felt great for the time we had it. But it was complicating the divorce matters and I couldn‚Äôt really focus on anything else. That stuff is all calming down and doesn‚Äôt require as much attention anymore.

Complicating matters, though, is after the first night I asked her not to tell anyone at work specifically, and she did, then everyone knew and was looking at me funny. Which didn‚Äôt feel great.

Also, we have literally nothing in common. I know she likes me and has feelings but long term prospects for me are grim. I don‚Äôt really want to take her out with my friends nor do I want people thinking we are dating. I dont want to enter a long term relationship right now and I want to date eventually, but that won‚Äôt come for a few months. And long term, I‚Äôm not interested in supporting another family. I fear part of the reason she ‚Äúfell‚Äù for me is because I‚Äôm a doctor, and I represent stability for her potentially.

I think I know the right answer is to continue to not hook up with her. But I dunno I‚Äôm struggling and want to. Now that my house is going to be empty 2/3 of the time I want to have someone to be with sometimes."
dating_advice,Ghosted then matched on Bumble,"So a few weeks ago I matched with a guy on Bumble. Gave him my number, we texted, and he eventually ghosted me. 

But this week, i came across him on bumble again and swiped right and about 10 minutes later we were matched again. 

I'm curious as to why he unmatched then rematched with me. So any opinions. Also what should i do? I'm partially tempted in texting him but not sure what to say."
dating_advice,Do you think the girl I like was flirting with me?,"So I'm 14 a freshman in highschool and this girl I'm really into has been low key flirting with me when we are at school or we meet up outside of school. Today has cemented that she probably likes me back. So after school everyone normally goes to this store near our school to grab a snack or something and we went over there it was the girl I like her friend my sister and I and she made a joke along the line of calling me ""a snack"" which I immediately went quiet with my sister looking at me I just kinda giggled and I didnt say anything else. Was she flirting with me or am I crazy??"
dating_advice,"I hate the saying, ‚Äúwhen you know, you just know‚Äù","I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs true for some couples, but this mentality has put a lot of pressure on my significant other [23 M] and I [26 F]. We‚Äôve been friends for a couple of years now, and started dating for almost 2 months (exclusive BF &amp; GF). 

Anyway, his two best friends both met their partners, and within months fell head over heels and got married. My boyfriend does not have much experience with dating in general. However, he works in the wedding industry and I fear he sees a fantasized side of love. 

I‚Äôve been only in long term relationships (first was three years, second was five years). My boyfriend has mentioned he is worried that we haven‚Äôt felt the spark of ‚Äúwhen you know, you just know‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs BS to expect anything within a year. I do love him, and I have told him this but he isn‚Äôt at the same level as me (he hasn‚Äôt said I love you to anyone ever). I don‚Äôt expect anything from him because I chose to tell him that I loved him, but I have created unintentional pressure on him.

He‚Äôs been acting pessimistic about our relationship, and I think we get along great but we need more time. However, I think he‚Äôs preparing to have us call things off. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I want to keep things going because I see great potential for us. 

What should I do to keep him engaged in seeing things through with me? How am I able to get him to re-connect with me?"
dating_advice,Too late to change date time and activity?,"So, I recently cold-messaged someone I loosely knew, like 5 years ago, and after brief conversation I asked if they were seeing anyone, and if they'd like to grab a drink. They said they were recently single, and interested. I live in a different city, with no car, and it takes like 3 hours each way, 50-60 bucks round trip. I'm not broke or anything, but this'll be relevant a little later. So, after she agreed and conversation moved on just a little, I offered a specific day for the date, in middle February, because I have a concert (big name in a smaller venue) I'm going to...I have a spare ticket already on-hand...So, I offered it to her. Something like ""Drinks, and if it's not too late and things go well, we can hit the concert?"" She works very early AM and it's on a Wednesday, so I offered her the chance to bail on the concert if needed for work / whatever. 

 I know that Drinks + concert (smaller venue or not) isn't an ideal first date, even if you loosely knew someone years prior. We'd never hung out privately. I don't visit her city usually without a reason...She would be enough of a reason, I wouldn't mind weekly/bi-weekly trips over there to take her out on dates and get to know her in the beginning stages, until (if) spending nights at each others homes became a thing.

This was arranged 3 days ago. Since then there's been minimal contact, just me wishing her a good morning and good day, once this morning, and her thanking me. (just keeping loose contact so as to stay fresh, since it's 3 weeks away. I don't plan to contact her too much, unless she messages me first.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to my question. Is it too late (date is like 3 weeks ahead of now) or bad form, or look bad, or insert why it could be a bad idea here, to message her and see if she would be game for drinks before that date? Maybe a week or two before? My line of thinking is, maybe the first date will go horrible during drinks and there won't be compatibility, so concert would be a fail. Or, on the other hand, a separate date that is shorter and more casual could go very smoothly, making the concert a -great- setup for a second date.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Is this already too set for me to suddenly ask for a sooner first date? Is it worth spending the money on this change of plans, and make two trips? If I SHOULD attempt to move dates, when would be a good suggestion? Closer or further from the concert?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Reddit!"
dating_advice,Take A Break From Talking?,"So I (20M) have been talking to this girl for about a week and half, I'm getting a vibe that she wants to keep talking to me but I also feel like I'm often carrying the conversation.

I tried to break it off with someone after a couple of dates a while back and they ended up stalking me and now im paranoid incase it happens again.

dating_advice,Dating Advice,"May be a tad long but I will try to make this short. Met a guy and we hit it off pretty quickly. We share the same culture &amp; morals- all in all we think very similarly. He was very open and honest. We hung out multiple times &amp; spoke regularly. He mentioned that their was a girl he has known for a while, which he told her that they can be friends but nothing more. However, he mentioned to me that he felt a type of way because he would be choosing me over her (which has happened in the past). He spoke to the girl &amp; mentioned that he wanted to move forward with me... she did not take this well AT ALL, which made him feel even worse about the situation. When he brought it up again I suggested that he ""tried things out"" with her because I didn't want him thinking about her while we tried to move forward. I made this suggestion because I want to ensure he is confident in the decision he makes. For the past week he has messaged me, but the messages are not as they used to be (I'm assuming because he is figuring his own stuff out). Within the week he did ask to see me again, but has not seen her (Yet). I guess I don't know what to do and my question is, have you ever been in this situation? What did you do? How did you handle it? Did you ""wait"" or did you ""walk away""?"
dating_advice,Health problems when dating...,"So a slightly strange question here - I had cancer three years ago but have recovered well but i spent a lot of that time in and out of hospital and recovering so was not in mainstream education etc. 

If I date/meet a guy I like, it will usually come up in conversation and I don‚Äôt mind talking about it when I know the person better as it explains why I took some time off from university etc. 

Was wondering if a guy would ever see this as a negative when dating? As in think that it‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòbaggage‚Äô in a way? 

I know in my heart of hearts that I should be damn proud of having come through such a tough time but just curious about people‚Äôs honest opinions"
dating_advice,Why did she ghost me in this strange way?,"I (26M) started using Tinder (rather to find a girlfriend). I have to mention, I have very low expectations regarding this app, to start with.

And on 2nd day I clicked very well with one of matches (but I try to keep expectations low still). We had 3 days of really nice chat. Next day was quite quiet from her. So one more day after, I asked if she's got more time to chat. But she offered a date instead. Wow, nice. So we settled 3 day ahead, and continued to chat at medium level until the day.

And BOOM. She cancelled the date 2h before time, saying she feels sick (like tried and dizzy, not a disease). She wants to postpone the date, but she gives no day offer. So I interpreted, she doesn't want to meet. She had met someone more suitable probably. Sure, I was disappointed, but I moved on.

However, she started texting me after a few hours. And it was in a very nice way. Next day, she started texting me on way to work (which is a sign of a bit of emotional commitment, I think, doesn't look like dumping someone at least). So I started thinking she was really sick the previous day. And BOOM. She ghosted me the same day. I texted her once the next day, but got no reply. I decided to not make myself an idiot, and forgot about her.

So far, her way of ghosting me looks strange to me. Maybe she wanted to be nice or something, ok. But BOOM. She texted me today, 9 days after the last message from her. And it's just an answer to my casual question about hobbies from a week ago. Just that.

What is wrong? Is she strange, or am I? What should I do? I think I'm being played as a 2nd option (or rather 3rd or 5th). But I really like her, so I'm thinking about replying casually after 2 or 3 days, so not to let her play me that easily."

To be honest, I'm not attracted to him (I'm into older guys), but I don't know if I should try it out because I'm super bbn introverted, don't feel ready for the commitment, and we're totally different (different interests and perspectives which I guess is a good thing).

dating_advice,Alternative/additional suggestions for online dating apps/sites?,"Hey everyone, so not too long ago I (19M) decided that I wanted to step into the dating scene by trying out online dating. I know that online dating isn't always a good, reliable and worthwhile alternative to doing this in person, but I'd still like to try it for a little bit. I've been using Tinder (one of the most commonly suggested dating apps out of them all), but unfortunately haven't had much luck with it so far. A vast majority of the women who I (miraculously) get matched with don't seem too involved in actually using the app to meet people. They often have things like ""I'm not very active on here, hmu on my snap"" or something along those lines in their bio. When I try to talk to them and start things off, they either flat out don't respond at all, or they do but only a couple of times before they go silent. The userbase doesn't seem to care, they aren't active. 
So, do any of you know of other similar, more active apps (or even websites, as long as they're safe) that I could try? I really want to talk to meet and talk with people, make friends and maybe find a girlfriend. This is my first time seriously trying to put myself out there for this, and I'd like it to not be for nothing. (If course, if the online route doesn't work at all, I'll opt for the real thing.) Thanks."
dating_advice,Need advice on liking a girl that doesn‚Äôt live in the same country as I do,"So this winter break I went to visit my family in asia. Went there for about a month and met this beautiful, and caring girl (18). We went in many dates, drank together, talked about life stuff, and we both like each other. Knowing our mutual feelings towards each other, at the end of the day we both understood it was time for me to go back to the states for college. So I just came back this week, and we still talk and Snapchat all the time. What sucks is obviously not being able to physically see her and be by her side. We agreed to stay friends but if I do go back during the summer, which is in like 4 months, and we happened to both be single and not seeing anyone. What should we do? Continue just being friends even though we know we like each other? We aren‚Äôt considering long distance relationship cause we both agreed that‚Äôs too much. Or are there any suggestions?

I‚Äôve never had this sensation before in this scenario ‚Äì I‚Äôve been in 2 serious relationships and I always felt relaxed, excited and in control when going through that getting to know each other/dating phase. I've only ever felt like this when I've felt something is wrong.

I guess I'm shocked at how quickly I've developed feelings, and my thoughts are focused on negative things like what if she goes off me the more she gets to know me, fear of getting hurt etc. and I really don't want to end screwed up again as all this sort of relationship anxiety turns me into an absolute wetwipe, and totally destroys my productivity and current goals.

dating_advice,My (25 F) Self esteem plummeted after online date with (25M). Don't know how to cope,"I been online dating for a while and usually my dates end up awkward and the dudes never compliment me on my looks or anything else which makes me feel like crap. Anyway last nights date took the cake, we met on okcupid and everything seemed decent through texts, I didn‚Äôt catfish him and used real pics, he said I was pretty. We even video chatted and everything seemed ok. So we meet and from the first sight of me he seemed kind of eh (not a warm greeting like he was excited to see me, my first clue that he didn‚Äôt like my looks). I dressed normal and had my hair and makeup done. I came late and the movie we wanted to see was closed, so we decided to just talk in the car. It was really awkward he seemed annoyed at me? When I get nervous I talk a lot, but he didn‚Äôt seem like he was interested in me or wanted to know me anyway which made it all worse. So he came up with some excuse that he had to go (obviously wanted the date to end) I knew he was never ganna see me again so I figure what do I got to lose? Let me text him and see why the hell this keeps happening to me on dates. 

So i text him and he confirmed he didn‚Äôt want to see me again, I said what was it? My looks, personality. What? He said both, the whole package of me was bad and something was just off about me. I know I‚Äôm kind of awkward, but what got to me was that he said my looks were bad too, I said I didn‚Äôt catfish him and I video chatted him so I don‚Äôt know whats up? To which he didn‚Äôt reply. 

I feel like total shit. I‚Äôm not the ugliest girl in the world but I guess im like a meh 5, I always think that if I video chat the dudes I plan to meet and if they still wanna see me everything will go fine, but that obviously wasn‚Äôt the case they still end up not liking me or my looks? I just feel like shit that I‚Äôll never be pretty enough, I hate the feeling of guys not being attracted to me in person, because if a guy thinks your hot its very hard for him to hide it. Now my self esteem is CRUSHED and I‚Äôm kind of starting to resent men for making me feel like this"

dating_advice,Could use some advice,"[19M, NYC] My dating life has been ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for awhile now. I try not to focus too much on finding a significant other but I‚Äôm also tired of acting like it doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôm a quiet person (I don‚Äôt consider myself introverted, I‚Äôm just a little shy), I don‚Äôt leave my house much unless it‚Äôs to go to work, to grab something to eat, or to go to the gym, and I don‚Äôt have many friends (by choice).

dating_advice,Person (19F) I (21M) think I love has a relationship of 4.5 years in which she is not completely happy and I don't know how to proceed to make the next step.,"**TL:DR at the bottom!**

Before I start this post I want to say that their relationship is pretty messed up. They have cheated multiple times on each other going back as far as 3 years so there is no trust between them whatsoever. She can't check his phone but he can check hers. I know this does not make it acceptable but it is kinda what I tell myself so I'm ok with it.

After about three weeks (last weekend) she told me she loved me after our first kiss. I hesitated to say it back but did so to not ruin the moment. I think I do love her now and have also told her.

A little background info that has lead to this point:

We met at a New Years party, almost a month ago. Neither of us actually planned on going but we both did and we are both happy we did. Since then we have been texting pretty much everyday. Up until now we have met every weekend except for one. But never alone, we always met up with our friend group that was created during the party that night. The friend group consists of her, her best friend, a friend of mine which also knows the friend, and me. The reason why she does not want to meet up alone is because she is scared that more will happen than is acceptable, although in my point of view that already happened with that kiss, and just the way we talk. Eventually, a lot more stuff has happened that you don't do with friends, but not sex.

I've been feeling pretty bad the last few days because of the following, which is also why I am making this post to get some opinions: She tells me she wants me, that she wants to get to know me better and that we have a big chance at succeeding long term. But that she needs some time to get her mind straight and make a smart decision. I, however, understand her completely that it's not an easy choice to make, but at the same time I feel like I am just being used as a side fling. Even though she told me that is not the case.

We definitely feel good with each other. We can also talk about anything. We are very open with each other about almost anything. The only thing we don't talk about is what they do with each other in their relationship. Is she actually thinking about breaking up... I honestly don't know since they still see each other multiple times a week for long periods of times.

I don't think I can wait much longer. I feel like she just has to decide whether she wants to continue her relationship. In the end I also just want her to be happy. I also don't want to rush her but it gets hard at times.

I am sorry if this post is a mess but I hope everything is clear. I feel like there is so much more to tell. I really believe she is genuine about the way she feels. She is just insecure to make the decision because of the unknown. It's what she is used to and change scares her.

Am I setting myself up for heartbreak? Should I pursue this relationship because I really see us long term? Is there anything I can tell her that will help her make the choice of breaking up?

I will be reading all the comments and I would really like some advice on this one!

**TL:DR: We have been dating for almost a month and we have told each other we love each other but she has a relationship where there is no trust anymore and she is not a 100% happy. Do I pursue this in the risk of getting hurt? How long can I wait before waiting is too long?**"
dating_advice,Is there anything I can do in this situation?,"I (21M) went on one date with this girl (21F) after  matching on tinder (let's call her Ann).

Before the date, I asked Ann if she wanted to get a drink with me and she replied with ""yes :)"", and so we talked about plans. During this, Ann figures out that I go to a difference college, (which is about an hour away) and she gets a little dicey, and then says it makes her uncomfortable. I said lets shelf this convo for later.

A few days past making conversation, and I ask Ann again, and she thinks it won't work. Bummer. We still continue to chat like friends.

During the weekend, I get pretty drunk and sent Ann a message saying ""I think it can work,"" and she agrees to go on a date. Between this time, we're still snapchatting and being funny, honestly I already feel a connection I don't get from other people.

We go on the date, and things went REALLY well. We just talked at a bar for like 2 hours and then walked around town talking about our past and laughing and everything. We had so much in common and I could really vibe with this person. It's the best date I've ever been on. I also feel like she was into me the whole time. After the date, I ask Ann ""do you want to do this again,"" and she replied with ""I think so, would you still be interested?"" and I replied with ""I would be very interested"" and hugged.

We talk a little after the date, same as usual.

I get a text yesterday saying, paraphrasing ""I'm way to busy to be dating someone, I have 2 jobs and college and I'm at my limit. It's nothing you did, you did everything right."" We talk a little after that and she doesn't really budge. 

Now we're still talking like there isn't this thing between us.

What should I do? Usually I just write this off and go to the next person, but I serious like this person. I understand if I cant really do anything, but I feel like I have to try something, because I feel like Ann is someone who I should try for."
dating_advice,How can I go about going on first dates with 2 girls?,"Hi everyone,

So I went on Tinder to try my luck, and after a few months of endless swiping, I got 2 matches at the same time. Both seemed seriously interested. I went on a 1st date with Girl1 and already arranged a 2nd date. Now Girl2 wants to meet as well. We've only been texting so far.

I don't feel comfortable dating someone for long enough and then dump them because *there's someone else I was dating the entire time, and* ***I*** *couldn't decide.*

I just need to spend some time with each of them before deciding and I don't know how to approach this, in the least selfish way. I don't want to fuck it up and then lose both"

dating_advice,Dating in the wonderful city of Calgary in 2020,"Thought I would post about my (38M) dating experience in Calgary.

**Bumble:** The app where women have to message first. Unlimited daily likes, you can swipe for hours on end. The first day you sign up you sit on the top of the list, so it tells you that there may be 30 or more people that swiped right on you. I have subscribed to see the people who righted me only to be disappointed in the quality. Im sure there is a lot of good women on here, just a crap shoot in order to match with them. Im sure that the superswipes you can buy don't make a difference at all. I have bought a few times, and never matched with someone who I sent it to. As a guy, I have lots of matches expire as the woman didn't send a message to open up a dialogue. This app is promoted as one for relationships, and not hookups.

**Hinge:** Another free app. You can buy a preferred membership for $26/month. Preferred gets you unlimited likes to give away instead of the daily limit of ten. You can pick a persons picture or part of their profile and make a comment on it, and hope that they reply. The app claims its designed to be deleted, as caters more towards people looking for a relationship. Personally found that you don't get many people liking you unless you send the max amount of likes per day. If you X people and don't use the app you go to the bottom of the pile and get no action.

**Match:** A free site that has an app. Phone app and computer site are quite different. If you don't pay the subscription you have very limited access. You can't see pictures, read messages, basically just send likes. When you subscribe you get full access. I paid about $45 for a month. Lots of profiles, many people that claim they are looking for a long term relationship. Problem is many of the profiles don't pay for the subscription, or have left the site altogether, leaving messages with people you find compatible very infrequent. I cancelled my month early as I didn't want to renew and be put through another month of sending messages and getting no replies.

**Tinder:** I haven't used this in years, I have always seen it as more of a young person hookup app, and that's the opposite of what Im seeking. Not sure how many people in their late 30s have had success, but would love to hear peoples opinions.

**Meetup:** Not a dating app or site, but a way to meet new people with similar interests. I have attended a few events in the past, but haven't seen anything decent in the last while that made me want to attend an event again. A few groups that do charity work, but looks like very few people sign up. 

So what's the best way to meet a partner in Calgary?"
dating_advice,20 Male need an advice to ask a female out,"I met this girl about two weeks ago, she is the daughter of my father's friend.  Her family visited us and I sat with them, my behavior was a bit awkward but she kept on smiling and holding eye contact with me (she seemed interested in me).

A week later I visited her family ""with my family"" and I spoke to her a few, she asked some questions about my job, personality, Horoscope sign (she is crazy about this stuff) and she said the she would like to go biking with me and she added me on FB too, After almost 50 minutes she changed her mind and said a friend of her father want to visit them at the same day and she can't go out.

The bad thing is Her sign does not match with my horoscope (I DON'T care about this stuff but she does) 
Her Parents might not let her go out with me (culture stuff, btw. she's already 19) MAYBE because of this she couldn't go biking with me or she just to play hard-to-get.
And I don't know if she is looking for relationship or friendship

Her Family might visit us in the next 4-5 days, should I talk to her on FB or should I ask her out in the real world?

dating_advice,Should I tell guys my situation?,"Gonna try and condense this as much as possible. I‚Äôm 29f, good looking, smart etc.   I got into a relationship with a 40m like 6 years ago.  I moved in and sold my house.  Later found out he‚Äôs a narcissistic, abusive, drug addict that‚Äôs just detrimental in every way shape and form.   I have no family and basically no support and I would‚Äôve left this guy so so long ago but I have no where to go.  I make money but he just keeps me and my daughter who‚Äôs 8 in a messed up situation and I end up having to spend it all on just living.  He may act like he hates me but he‚Äôs just so broken on the inside that I know he‚Äôs desperate for me to never leave him (never being able to leave him through his manipulation of situations,people etc).  Well I deserve to be happy no matter what kind of fucked up situation I‚Äôve found myself in.   I talk to other guys, I‚Äôve met up with a couple guys. I don‚Äôt just run around wild and screw everybody I see Whatsoever.  It‚Äôs the normal conversations and normal personal exchanges that I seek in these guys and when they try to get sexual I always find a way to slip away.   Well the guy I live with puts trackers on my vehicle cameras everywhere recorders everywhere.  So u can imagine that it‚Äôs become increasingly harder to manipulate all the surveillance in order to pursue these outings.   It hasn‚Äôt really bothered me that much until I met a guy that I‚Äôm reAlly starting to like.   He has no idea of my living situation. I‚Äôve been completely open and honest with him about everything except for he thinks I live alone.   We‚Äôve been chatting for about 5 months and we‚Äôve hung out three times. Each time it was hard to pull myself away to return to the fucked upness of my ‚Äúhome‚Äù.    In the beginning I thought I‚Äôd just tell him what was really up but each conversation we had made it seem a little bit harder for me to be able to admit this to him.  And time went on and here we are.  Me and this guy aren‚Äôt talking about anything crazy but we know that we gotta really cool and potential connection. It‚Äôs special. And I want to hang out more of
Course but It‚Äôs a big big deal each time I go to hang out with him like I have to locate the tracker and do all this counter shit just for a couple hours of awesome conversation with. Cute dude.   So my question is.... do you, as guys, care if a girl has a boyfriend that she lives with?   Are most guys willing to play that part and sneak around or do guys think that makes the girl like a skeez or?   I didn‚Äôt tell him in the start cause I thought he would instantly just cut it off with me cause really who needs those dramatics?"
dating_advice,Should I tell my girlfriend I turned down sex?,[removed]
dating_advice,HELP ME PLEASE,"So how I'm in this position is completely bizarre and weird but here goes, I'm interning in Europe and I'm 19. I matched with this Slovakian girl on Bumble and we went out together last week however she didn't count it as a date because I said something really bad before, before I say what I said I have to warn you all that I may or may not have Aspergers and I am extremely introverted, my main activities include studying chess, my university course work and playing my instruments, I often spend months alone reading chess books for leisure while listening to classical music. Since high school I basically haven't made any friends and haven't really give a shit about relationships (friends/romantic) at all. I've been really focused on trying to create a good career for myself and since I'm in another country I decided to try out Tinder/Bumble since I am starting to feel more lonely. 

Okay so please don't give me hate for what I said. I said pretty much verbatim ""Can you not wear makeup, I hate makeup."" about 2 hours before we were supposed to meet after she sent me a vid of herself saying a few words. She reacted really badly and I was in complete shock, she proceeded to tell me it wasn't a date and  that we were just going to meet up. So I was fine with that.

&amp;#x200B;

When we were meeting up I felt pretty normal and I talked to her the way I always talk to people: Straight forward, to the point, keeping emotions out and using logic. (So I've learned that females don't like this? :)) anyway, another instance of where I think I messed up was when we were in Starbucks, she was trying to quiz me on what kind of coffees I like so she could pick a drink for me, and she suggested something with caramel and another sweet one (can't remember the name) so I said ""I hate caramel"" and I got my regular order (large cappuccino with no sugar). 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I was feeling pretty good about myself, I had met up with a girl and though it wasn't a date, I thought things were going well. However to my utter disbelief she started telling me that she didn't like my tone and that I need to speak differently. I didn't like this at all, because I always aim to be myself around everyone and try and act the same at all times. She actually ended up telling me she didn't want to date me and only wanted to be friends. So of course the first thing I had to ask was ""was it because of my looks?"" She said no which was a huge relief. I then asked her hypothetically if ""I was normal?"" would she date me and she said yes.

dating_advice,My(M26) colleagues want to make me 'date-able' apprehensive as hell...,"I gotta say, my family, friends and colleagues deserve a frigging medal for the amount of effort they put in in trying to pair me off with someone, although I wonder if that's just their way of trying to get rid of me...

Onto the matter at hand, my long streak of being a single virgin somehow reached my workplace that is pre-dominantly women and just to preface this now, these women are married, engaged in LTR, or heavily career focused, so there's no shitting where I'm eating before anyone says anything.

A number of them that I usually speak to and get along with in banter have decided to do a 'do-up' for me, by which they're going to take me shopping for clothes that'll make me look approachable and attractive along with stylists and health experts to provide me with an exercise and diet plan (I'm not overweight but I'm sure as hell not poster-boy material either.)

On top of that, they're planning on setting me up on the usual dating site suspects as well as arranging me to go out to bars and clubs for the old fashioned approach.

As I said, I'm thankful for the effort their putting in for my sake, but all of this feels like a far cry from what I REALLY am which is an introverted gamer that loves track clothes and loungerwear and that any potential candidates I attract are developing an interest in someone who is faking the entire act.

I'm going to go through with it regardless to at least say I've gone through the experience and not wasted their time, but I can't help but second-guess myself into thinking that it isn't going to end well."

dating_advice,deeper meaning of love,"i need advice whether to tell this boy i am honestly in love with him. this is the run down.

July 2019, i went to a bonfire on the beach with my friends. i say by my guy bestfriends bestfriend (if that makes sense). we talked all night and honestly had the time of our lives. we are going to call him B and my guy bestfriend R. We all went back to B‚Äôs house and i had a talk with a couple of his friends. they said b was into me and it was pretty obvious. i was so excited but a couple days later i thought it was all just a stupid idea to go for B but i could tell i already caught feelings. i didn‚Äôt see him for a couple of months but we started to snapchat eachother heavily around the end of october. (we lived in two different cities 40 miles away from eschother). i didn‚Äôt care for the drive so anytime we wanted to hang i would go down to see him. we would have such a good time but we did nothing romantic because i always brought a friend bc i was scared. the first night i went down alone, it was dark out. he took me to this spot that looks over the water and a couple miles away you could see the building lights and it was so beautiful. the next day he asked if i could come down and watch the sunset from his boat. i was sick so i couldn‚Äôt go but we kept talking and talking. Thanksgiving came around and he told me to come see him. i drove with my sister because she was already planning on going to her boyfriends beach house. B came and picked me up and let me tell you... this is the night i fell in love. we ate thanksgiving dinner with his family (which i loved) and we went to his room and talked for hours. i looked at my phone and it was already 1 AM. he took me outside to his balcony the was over the water and he laid down on the couch and i laid next to him and we looked at the stars for 3 hours and named them our own names. i didn‚Äôt know at this point if we were just friends or more but he ended up putting his arm around me. We went inside around 3 or 4 AM and went to his room. we laid in his bed for hours and didn‚Äôt even kiss until 6 AM because we were so busy getting to know eachother. we planned trips together and started coming up with ideas on how to travel the world together.. from bora bora to the bahamas to switzerland. then came 6:30 AM and he told me he had a surprise. he took me to the beach and made us our own personal bonfire to watch the sunrise. i felt like i had been in love with B for years. but this is where it came crashing down. we went back to his house and fell asleep. around 10 AM i got a facetime call on my phone and B answered. it was R, my guy bestfriend. he didn‚Äôt know i was at his house and he became livid. i talked to R when i went back to my city TWICE and he said it was okay for me to go for B. so 3 nights later i went back and saw B and everything was the same between us. He wasn‚Äôt afraid to show his friends whst he felt for me. i have never felt this way about anyone and i knew he felt the same way too. but... R ended up telling B that it wasn‚Äôt okay for him to go for me even though he told me different. after that i didn‚Äôt see B for a month and lost connection with him. I ended up going to his city the day after christmas and he told me to come to his house. he had 2 friends over and i had one of my friends with me. we didn‚Äôt talk at all but once his dog came i started petting him and B ended up petting him too. he accidentally touched my hand while petting his dog and i thought it was just a mistake. until he went back to pet his dog and ended up grabbing my hand holding it. we ended up having sex but then after we didn‚Äôt talk much because we didn‚Äôt know if R would find out. it was just my birthday and i spent it with all my friends in his city. my guy bestfriend R ended up calling B and we all hung out together. we didn‚Äôt talk once but we kept making eye contact together and everytime i felt thst click. once we got back to the place we were staying, my girl bestfriend and i had a long talk in the bathroom. she told me i should text B and talk to him because i was so hurt by not talking to him that i started hurting other people. we hadn‚Äôt snapchat for a long time and i ended up texting him ‚Äúhey can we talk sometime this week‚Äù and he ended up responding instantly. he told me yea and that he was sorry he forgot to bring my necklace. we have been planning on when to talk and i‚Äôm supposed to see him tomorrow. should i tell him how i feel. what should i say?"

dating_advice,How do i cheat?,"Ok, so here's the story. Me (30/m) and my wife (28f) are both never leaving each other unless a body bag or two is involved. That said, she taps out before I get off literally about 95% of the time. And I mean that as in I am the type of guy who can (sometimes) induce a seizure in women without any seizure disorder just from making her cum too hard/too many times. I'm not bragging, this is basically a fucking nightmare. But I digress.
So anyway, she's steering me towards my friends she wants 3 ways with and I was doing my best to land us a girlfriend, but went a bit too far with my first choice of a  friend (25f). And I'm kinda pissed about that, because even the mrs admits anyone on earth would think she was trying to get us to bang while she fapped to the moans upstairs. So we did. And she did. (We heard her break out her vibrator after about 20 min) And somehow now she's mad about it? Like, she was up there masturbating to the squeaks and moans the friend made as i went to town on her...and I'm just so fucking confused."

dating_advice,Was he a narcissist?,"I (19F) was talking on and off with this guy I met online (19M) for around 8 months last year. I was curious if anyone who has studied psychology or just anyone in general think this guy is a narc for the way he treated me, or was it my fault or in my head? 

When we started talking he would often lovebomb me, he‚Äôd constantly talk about how beautiful I was and all the stuff he wanted to do with me (like dates n all). After our first date he told me he ‚Äúsaw potential in  us‚Äù,  believed we were going to ‚Äúlast long‚Äù. On our second date he even said hi to my Mum and dad before we left because he said he wanted to. 

He would often say things that I thought were jokes at the time but now I think about it, were kind of insulting. When we were talking about meeting for the first time he said ‚Äúi can laugh at you when If you do something wrong but you can‚Äôt laugh at me‚Äù. I wore hair extensions at the time due to feeling self conscious about my hair. I asked him on our first date if he cared if my hair was really short and he said ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs not really short‚Äù and points to some old lady with really short hair. On our second date I moved away subtly when he was trying to touch me (I don‚Äôt like too much touching after a while if that makes sense) and he raised his voice at me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù. On our first date he also told me that most of the girlfriends he has had, had ‚Äúcheated on him‚Äù. 

So he got really hot and cold after the second date. And then he ghosted me. I had to ask him if he wanted to just be friends as I already knew he was no longer liking me that way despite all the lovebombing he did, he said ‚Äúyea I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Äù.

So we still talked until he ghosted me again. Then the next week he kept trying to get my attention and I gave in. I was trying to be platonic as friends but then he started using ‚Äúx‚Äôs‚Äù and calling me beautiful again in messages. Of course I gave in again. I ended it when I ghosted him because he kept leading me on, not wanting to meet, and being confusing in general. 

I would post repost those ‚Äúbreakup quotes‚Äù on Facebook and he would like them. I started talking to him a few weeks later and i got mad because he was leading me on again and deleted me on Snapchat I went to Facebook and wrote something that was about him but didn‚Äôt mention his name (no one knows who he even is). The next morning he got mad saying.

‚Äúdude stop posting about me, you are embarrassing yourself, we don‚Äôt even talk‚Äù

I sent an apology because I shouldn‚Äôt of done that and I always wanted to be on his good side, he asked things like ‚Äúwhy do you care about me so much‚Äù, ‚Äúdo you still have feelings for me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see those posts ever again‚Äù. 

I never spoke to him for three weeks after this. Until we made out at a club that we bumped into and he told me very drunkingly that he wanted to ‚Äúsee me again‚Äù. He ghosted me the next day and turns out he was flirting with my best friend trying to ask her out. My friend told him that he wasn‚Äôt very nice to me and he said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just twisting stuff but believe what you want‚Äù.

So I find out through a mutual a month ago that he‚Äôs gotten into an official relationship. He posted this thing on Facebook about how his mate has ‚Äúabandoned the boys‚Äù by getting into a relo. I got very jealous because as you guys have read this is how I was treated and this girl is getting the best of him. He posts pictures with her (which he appears happier than we did) his friends all follow her, he has a Spotify playlist about her. Of course, because I was never in a relationship with him he did not do this stuff with me, he wouldn‚Äôt even see me in person after the second date. 

I shouldn‚Äôt of done this but I requested her on Facebook on both social media (I assumed she wouldn‚Äôt of known who I was) turns out she did and told him. He blocked me on everything. Me being so upset I wanted to ‚Äúapologise for all I have done‚Äù and was so happy for him in his relationship and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying this in the nicest way possible but please stop requesting my girlfriend‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm trying to get over this guy and move on. But sometimes I think maybe i was supposed to get treated like this. I actually currently see a psychologist so I‚Äôm trying to get extra help. Was just wondering if this guy sounds like a narc so I know what to look for next time."

dating_advice,Are my expectations too high ?,"To begin with, I've never been in a relationship, nor did I ever try to date anyone. It's not something that I'm interested in atm. But I've been talking about what I want and don't want my partner to be and my friend told me that I was too exigeant. Is that true ?

- No smoking or doing drugs, just someone with a normal and healthy way of life

- Non-believer

- I don't mind if they have some weight but definitely not too overweight or obese

- Not trying to act tough to seem manly, idc if they are or not

- has the same interests as me, or is open to them

- Doesn't expect me to be housewife/doing all the chores/having children once we're married, I want us to be equals

- See the future : I don't want to go out with someone who thinks that our relationship will end in a month or so

- Not afraid to confront me to reality. When I do or say something wrong, I'm one to apologise. But I'm human, so I don't always realise I'm being a douche. Obviously, I expect him to accept criticism like I do.

I have always thought that these were normal, but I've been told that it's a little bit too much. I mean, it's not like I'm looking for a perfect guy with abs who treats me like a princess and stuff. Can you tell me if it is too much ? So that when I'll be looking for a date I won't be disappointed. Also, I live in France, so there are definitely more non-believer and less obese people than in America, and people are very straight-forward so finding a guy able to confront me to my drawbacks isn't that hard, even tho there are a lot of men scared to criticise their woman and don't take criticism well too."
dating_advice,I'm starting to realize I can't text. How can I improve?,"There's this girl I've been seeing, who also texts me a lot. Right now we can't see for a few weeks because she's travelling, but I'd like to stay in contact with her. Only problem is I don't know what to text because I'm terrible at it. I'm like this with all my friends, I text them very rarely. I'd like to make an exception with her, but at the same time I didn't want to bore her with pointless chatter. I'm the most boring person I know so there's a high chance she'll lose interest if I don't make an effort. 


What should I do?"
dating_advice,Don‚Äôt Make Time For People Who See You as A second Option,"Trust Your Gut Feeling And Don‚Äôt Go for People who See You As A Second Option or Backup Plan.

Long story short: I(25)M meet Her(25F) over the summer from the dating app hinge. First date went great stayed to bar past closing and made out like lost lovers. We began going on more dates and I stated to like her. However, I noticed reg flags like flaky behavior and she took her time to get back texting. Very spoiled and entitled parents pay for her lifestyle and apartment(still in school). But I began to ignore them because I had some feelings.  Thought she was attracted to me because every time we hung out we had fun and hooked up. About a month and a half in she became very busy out of all the sudden but still texting me leading me on. After not like seeing each other for three weeks we finally planed to hang. On the day We were supposed to hang out she texting before that something bad happened. I texted her what happened and if everything was OK and she told me ‚Äúnot now‚Äù. The next day she texted me I should MoveOn. I was upset but I said OK I moved on. 

Fast forward to November. I get a text from her at a nowhere saying that she‚Äôs been meaning to reach out for a while and made a huge mistake and that she was very sorry about what happened. I knew that in there I should‚Äôve blocked her number and deleted the text. But me being the fool I was sad that she did nothing wrong and there‚Äôs nothing to be sorry about. We began texting more and we hung out but this time we was just looking for apartments for her but we kissed at end. And other time we got food at a diner and she showed up high as a kite and wouldn‚Äôt tell me where she was before and said she would tell me one day. 

After that she began to go dark on me again and I saw where this was going. Not to sound weird I did not have her on any social media she never added me back on Snapchat when I tried. However for some reason I had her Venmo I guess it Syncs your contacts. I saw that she was getting stuff from my guy for her birthday in August. That is in between the time when I saw her in the summer( told me to move on In July) and after she reached out to me in November. I did some NSA investigative work on social media and I found out it was her boyfriend. I texted her calling her out but realized it was not worth it. She was already beginning to Ghost. 

After having some time and think about this and reflect. I realize that you should never chase are going for people who don‚Äôt value you. You have to go with your gut feeling when it doesn‚Äôt feel good as much as you were physically and emotionally attracted to them. Unfortunately our brains are hardwired do you attracted to people who aren‚Äôt good for us and our self esteem. This girl for me was like a black widow. In nature the female black widow spider Kills the male after they mate usually and she eats him. I‚Äôm not in any need to jump into a relationship with anyone right now. But I know in the future what I want and how to be treated I hope you all would want the same. You should never be anyone second option or back up choice. If they didn‚Äôt want you at first he shouldn‚Äôt have you after coming out of another failed relationship. You should always value Someone who sees you as number one."

dating_advice,Should I bring this up to my guy ?,"Im talking to this man who technically is my boyfriend he broke up with me last September 2019. After giving him the break up staying no contact he starts to look for me I give in since I didn't want the break up. we start talking again texting,hanging out,sleeping together,going out to eat etc. everything that couples do. We had a talk and agreed that we were gonna work on ourselves but still talk and hang out. This past Saturday night we argued because I asked to sleep over and he said no he wanted to sleep alone in his own bed.(we slept together Friday night) My manipulating and co dependent  ways come out (I am working on that) and I start crying feeling sorry for myself because my man didn't wanna sleep with me. I start telling him that he doesn't love me enough to want to sleep with me 2 nights in  a row  I tell him hes never gonna marry me because married couples sleep together every night I go on ....

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually he reacts and pours his heart out telling me how my reaction to him saying no makes him feel he says that if its not my way its no way. So I get up and start heading out to drop him off at his house we had a talk about the argument in my car before he goes in his house he came to tears and thats when I start realizing that Hey he is a grown man he is free to do what he wants  . I realized my behavior was wrong and I apologize so he gets out we hug say good night and he goes in I drive off and go home. When I get home  I text him ""Good night"" he replies ""Good Night"". I wake up the next morning around 7AM I dreamt of him and woke up feeling sad about the situation so I head out to his house to ask if I can sleep with him for the rest of the morning I knock on his window and realize hes not home. I knew it ! I knew it and I had a feeling he wasnt gonna be home. he either went out to drink with his budd or stayed in his get away place. he has a place where he goes to get away any times hes upset. 

It feels like he lied to me the previous night when he said he wanted to sleep in his own bed because he didn't sleep home.

I feel like the reason why he lied might've been because he didn't wanna tell me he was gonna go to his get away spot so that I wouldn't ask him again where he goes or what he does ? because he doesn't go only for the night he sometimes stays there 2 nights in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Should I bring it up to him that I know he didnt spend the night home and I feel like he lied to me ? 

BTW I saw him that following day everything was normal except I didnt mention to him about this but its been bothering me.

I live together with my ex girlfriend, this situation is messed up. And I actually want her to move out, but we are both in the middle in our internship. We have a shit load of fights. 
And I wouldn't like it either, if she had the power to kick me out and do that in the middle of my internship. So I am not kicking her out now.

So I am dating a old middle school friend and really like her, but I don't know if I should tell her I am not kicking her out till the internship is over.

I'm debating whether to ask her out or not (that's a whole other problem), but I'm struggling to find a time where we're both alone and I could get the chance to ask her. Usually the only times I see her are:

- when I'm on the public bus to school and I manage to sit across from her, but I couldn't ask her there, because there are like 30 other people within hearing distance.

- at school in the study room, but she's with her friends and there are ~100 other people in there

- waiting for the bus home, but she rarely gets the bus home and she's normally on the phone or there are other people.

I really don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated."
dating_advice,"He‚Äôs terrible at texting, is he not interested?","I‚Äôve been on a few dates w this guy, we have yet to have sex, but I feel that we have a really good connection. The only thing is that he sucks at texting back, he‚Äôll take up to a few days to do so. He seems to only text when making plans, but he hasn‚Äôt texted at all to make our next plans. The last text I sent was two days ago. It wasn‚Äôt a question or anything so didn‚Äôt need a reply. I know he doesn‚Äôt use his phone a lot, and it‚Äôs a really busy work week for him. 

I‚Äôm just worried bc I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard to send a quick text to show ur thinking of someone. Is he just not interested? How long should I wait before giving up or deleting his number? I don‚Äôt want to be strung along. He doesn‚Äôt use social media often so I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs been active or anything. How likely is it that he‚Äôs just not that interested in me?"

dating_advice,"My [20M] ex [20F] reached out to me again, and I don't know what to do","Okay I'll try to sum this up clearly, but about six months ago me and my then girlfriend broke up because I did some stupid shit. She wasn't mad with me anymore (she completely had the rights to be mad with me), but she decided that we should break up and still remain friends. I was completely devastated by it, but I accepted it. 

During the time we were still ''friends'' we talked very rarely and they were pretty dry conversations. About two months ago I really started to get over her and I finally started to be happy again, before that I was kind of happy, but I had periods where I was still heartbroken and depressed for a week here and there. 

Two weeks ago, she suddenly contacted me again and we had a very pleasant conversation that reminded me of the times before we started dating. We made plans to hang out some time and we did, last week. We went out for dinner and after dinner we went to my place to watch a movie and we had sex. Now I should mention that in the conversation two weeks ago she asked what my girl situation was and that we should have sex once again.

A couple days after we had sex she texted me asking if I wanted to do it more often, I of course said yes and we had another small conversation. After this however, I tried starting some other conversations but she would respond like 7 hours later and it was another incredibly dry conversation. 

I've been insecure for a long time and when things like this happen I always overthink it and I'm scared that she doesn't want me anymore and to be honest it just really takes a toll on me. I've been mildly depressed for about a year and she was the only thing that made me truly happy. When we hung out last week I realised that I am not over her yet and I keep thinking that we may try dating again in the future. 

I am scared that telling her all this is just going to make her dislike me or something and that I will go through the entire heartbreak process again.

What would you recommend me doing here? Should I stop now or see how it goes?

Thank you for responding."
dating_advice,I need advice [me 14M her 15F],So these past couple months I have been getting close with a friend of mine let‚Äôs call her Lucy for the sake of this. At first we were just friends and shared a strong bond. This past Saturday I stayed over there with her brother for the night and she was their. And we watched a movie on Netflix and while she was doing dishes and my friend was chatting with my sister. Me and her really started talking a lot and found a ton in common. So during the movie she set next to me and we were close during it (set next to each other) and both fell asleep their for a while. This was all when she was dating her then boyfriend.  So 2 days ago she broke up with her then boyfriend. I found out that she broke up with him for him being a jerk. I am attracted to her but I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I am a gentleman and we are both mature. Can I get some help here?
dating_advice,How do I [M19] approach my timid friend [F19] who is afraid of sharing her opinion/feeling so as as not to get rejected?,"Long story short, we have known each other for almost 5 years now. She is very cute and attracts me physically but she is also extremely shy. Somehow, I managed to break the ice a bit a couple of months ago and she started being more open and honest instead of the usual ""accommodating"" girl. Then she admitted the fear i mentioned in the title. Her beautiful body attracts me so much but this personality puts me off from dating her a bit. Nonetheless, I want to give it a go but I am not sure how I should approach her without making shy away from going out with me. Any ideas?"

dating_advice,How long to wait for a first kiss?,"Hi Reddit. I've(23M) been dating a girl(20F) for a little over a month now. We have been calling ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend for the past 2 weeks. It's been great but one thing I'm concerned is timing for a first kiss.

I'm her first boyfriend meanwhile I have dated before. She's inexperienced and learning but I really like her and want this to be a great thing for us. 

After our third date, I've been asking her if I could kiss her but she has always said no and says that she needs more time. We've been cuddling and crashing with one another but still no first kiss. I asked her and she says that's just afraid. We've gone on like 5 or 6 dates since. I kinda just gave up on asking her for it since I'm gonna get turned down.

I can understand that fear of kissing but I feel like kissing is a little necessary to cross that platonic line that we've drawn when we met last semester. I told her I'll be patient with her but is it fair for me if I just keep waiting for it to happen? Should we go back to not being exclusive? I still really like her but I'm confused."
dating_advice,Sending apology letter creepy?,"Would this be considered creepy?

Was seeing a girl for 2 months and it was brilliant. We really clicked and we both liked eachother alot.

But last weekend it took a turn for the worst and I might of messed it all up through drunk texting and ringing (being annoying)

We have sort of gone off talking to eachother the past couple of days which I'm taking it hard.

It's her birthday this weekend and I had a few wee presents already bought (nothing expensive just thoughtful) 

I was going to post these all to her along with an apology note in the birthday card. All in a smally jiffy bag.

Would this be considered creepy as she has shown me where her house is before a few times but never the address. But I've managed to get the address from looking it up online (she has own business linked to it)

I still very like this girl and want to send her these. I'm just afraid it might be considered creepy to send all this .

dating_advice,How can I be more confident?,"What exactly does it mean to be confident? 

So I‚Äôve asked questions (as many others have asked the same) about what makes a guy attractive to girls. 

I‚Äôve learnt that height, hygiene, body, and style is important physically but also personality (funny, honest and decent), and ambition are also key factors. 

But the biggest factor I‚Äôve seen over and over again,  is the CONFIDENCE. Confidence in a man can make up for him being short, ugly or having a bad body. Same way a girls looks can make up for her horrible personality etc. 

I‚Äôm average height (5‚Äô10) which brings me down. But I‚Äôm hygienic, I‚Äôve started working out, I consider myself artistic, unique and creative, also funny and laid back. 

However, I‚Äôll admit I have self esteem issues and I think the biggest reason I haven‚Äôt really ‚Äúshot my shot‚Äù is because I‚Äôm not confident enough. I‚Äôve 200 matches on Tinder and many times girls have made the first move with me etc. So I think that I could definitely get a GF/sex if I wanted to.... 

But I just need to be more confident, which is the most important thing. 

So how do I be more confident!? REAL confidence, for myself not just for girls. Thanks!"

It started of as casual. Nothing serious, but we started to care for each other, see each other more often, text everyday and become very romantic involved (no intimacy tho, we had sex a few times during totally casual phase but after we confessed that we care for each other we stopped). Now we are somewhere between casual and serious and im do lost. I tried talking to her about it to define some... Borders. Like being exclusive or seeing other people. We both got out of relationships this summer so im not ready to fully commit rn either but its very confusing at what page we are. 

Any tips?"
dating_advice,[27M] Having trouble reading the signs [28F],"I posted about this in another subreddit before finding this one, and just looking for advice. I was in a long term relationship that I got out of a year ago and spent some time focusing on myself to look out for my own personal well-being and to ensure I didn‚Äôt bring any baggage from that with me.

I had gone out on some dates over the past couple of months, but no one that I was really interested in seeing more than once or twice, until I met someone last month.

I have been talking and hanging out with that person for just over a month now, and I've had a great time with them. We both connect well and it doesn't feel forced. We last hung out about 2 weeks ago for nearly the entire day one weekend, I met some of her friends, and it seemed to go well, with her asking when she can see me again, etc.

However, after that, things really seemed to stall out. We made plans to hang out that were cancelled because of her work (totally fine, we're both busy professionally) but our conversations seemed to die out much quicker as well.

I messaged my female friend last week looking for some clarity, and received an almost instantaneous response apologizing and confirming that she was having a blast talking and hanging out, and wanting to continue it. All good, no problems, right? Instead, things seem to just continue to get cloudier.

She went out of town with friends after we talked, and messaged me occasionally, again reaffirming that she was looking to hang out again soon. We talked sparingly last week, both of us starting the conversation at different points, which is perfect.  I‚Äôm not someone who needs to text constantly, and we both had a lot going on. However, we made plans to meet up Friday night after we both got off from work. She cancelled again after getting out of work late with a large project, and we haven‚Äôt spoken since Friday evening. I‚Äôm getting a little frustrated with the situation, and feeling like I‚Äôm always putting myself out there and making time, just to have the plans be cancelled.

I enjoy spending time with this person, and we have a good connection, I don‚Äôt want to just let it fade. At the same time though, I don‚Äôt want to constantly be hassling them to hang out, to the point that they feel smothered. The last thing I want or expect from someone (especially someone I‚Äôm not even officially seeing) is constant attention, but I'm starting to feel like that might be the case when I'm the one trying to prompt real action to meet up. Any advice on how to handle the situation? Thank you!

TL;DR: Have been going out and seeing someone who always says they want to see me again, but conversations seem to be stalling more and more."

dating_advice,Red flag for a new girl I was dating to sort of threaten me with pepper spray?,"Let me preface this story by saying I am in no way a creepy guy or have done anything to scare this girl at all. I am extremely respectful and kind to a fault. I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù but I am very friendly to people in general and try to make girls feel comfortable on dates because I know the horrors for women in regards to online dating.

So I went on a great first date with a girl. We clicked, talked for hours over dinner, and she invited me on second date which actually ended up starting at her house at her request. I had something else planned that she changed.

For some reason, she makes a joke over text about how I shouldn‚Äôt try to murder her even though she was the one inviting me into her home? Like why would you even say that if you feel that way about me. I didn‚Äôt find it funny but I cracked a joke saying almost exactly that but in a semi funny way back at her. I kinda just let it go.

Then when I arrive, she tours me the house and at one point shows me her pepper spray and says ‚ÄúI got this just in case you try anything funny tonight.‚Äù Like what? For one, I did nothing to warrant any threats. And two why would you show someone your weapon? That‚Äôs like lesson one in self defense.

Girls please chime in on why someone would act this way. It seems like she was trying to be funny but I found it very rude to be honest."

We hang out all the time, she talks about guys that've tried to talk to her, how bad it always goes, how she's sick off being single.

dating_advice,"Dating for a few months now, she tries to make me look perfect infront of her family.","Good morning folks,

I just found this subreddit a few minutes ago and I wanted to get some advice from you all. I am dating a 24 year old vietnamese girl that is very sweet and caring. I am a latino 24 year old man, lost my dad last year and lives with my mother and sister. I notice me she and I tend to have lots of debates about the most unusual stuff but nothing too critical as far as I'm concerned. One thing that is causing a consistent problem is that she tries to make sure that I behave perfectly infront of her family. A little bit about me, I have been working in banking for over 5 years now, people of all ages, I love engaging with people and developing a connection. I met her aunt and uncle last week and they were great folks, it didn't seem to go wrong, but I noticed throughout the interaction with them, my girlfriend kept wanting me to say ""Thank you"". In vietnamese, she told me once how to do it but of course I won't remember that, I kept doing it in English but she didn't like that. I brushed it off and thought it wasn't something too critical. Well just last night we had an argument over how she tells me exactly what her parents like and don't like, one thing she tells me to stop doing is to stop moving my eyebrows when I talk, now that is where I drew the line. I told her that I have no full control of my face when I engage, it's just my face. She keeps telling me that her parents don't like that we are the same age, that due to my age, I may be immature or not knowing what I want. My girlfriend says she wants to prove them wrong over time by showing them how much I care about her with our interactions, but this whole being worried about what her family thinks about me thing is starting to take a toll on me. I told her that her parents are folks who have much more life experience that her and I and I may not be perfect to the way my girlfriend wants me to seem to them, that she should let me just be myself and sure knowing things like what not to say will assist me in getting a decent relationship with them started, but when she  starts telling me to not move my eyebrows, to make sure I always make eye contact when I engage with her family. Saying thank you in Vietnamese when I don't have the first clue about the language, that they don't like me simply because I am 24, it feels a bit unfair and it brings my self-esteem down considerably. I have always worked hard to provide for my mother who's husband passed away, my father. My sister just turned 13 this year and I make sure that she's giving us good grades and has a healthy mind and lifestyle, all our bills get paid on time, I just bought a car for my family and myself, I feel like, sure I'm no Bill Gates, but I am making sure my family has a roof on their head and food on the table.  I apologize for the horrible format, I typed this through my phone."
dating_advice,Reasonable Red Flags or Cold Feet?,"I (26M) have been dating my girlfriend (25F) for about two years and things are getting serious. 

I love my girlfriend. We have experienced a lot of life together, get along great, and overall have a pretty normal healthy relationship. In fact, we are expecting to move into our first apartment together within the next six months. 

However, I‚Äôve noticed something recently that has been worrisome to say the least, so I‚Äôm turning to this sub. Essentially, I am looking for feedback to see if I‚Äôm being reasonable or if I should just get over myself. 

We had met in graduate school, through a mutual friend, and clicked immediately. It‚Äôs been great ever since. We barely fight, if at all and are much more willing to have a reasonable, logical, and open conversation rather than an all out screaming match. But this topic specifically makes me too uncomfortable to bring up to her. 

When we first started dating, she mentioned about this guy that had dumped her fairly recently and she was pretty upset about it. For some reason his name, let‚Äôs say ‚ÄúTim‚Äù stuck in my head. A couple weeks go by and we‚Äôre sitting in bed watching shows on her phone. I see a Messenger notification pop up from Tim and don‚Äôt think much of it. 1) Because we had just started dating and I could understand that the relationship wasn‚Äôt clearly defined at that point and 2) I didn‚Äôt consider myself a jealous person prior. 

A week or so goes by again, boom there‚Äôs Tim again, and my interest is piqued. Now I notice these exchanges going on back and fourth for a few months now and start to see red flags. My girlfriend hadn‚Äôt said his named to me since that initial conversation months before and they seem to talk pretty regularly. So I do something terrible. 

I betrayed her trust one night and went through her messages. To my surprises they have been talking essentially every day for months. Not only that, but there are a few guys that she is in a similar situation with. Conversations were mostly friendly but definitely flirtatious with many plans to ‚Äúgrab drinks.‚Äù 

I bring this up. BIG FIGHT. Essentially our only fight, but a substantial one nonetheless. She claims she was just really good friends with those guys and only met Tim out a few times for dinner and drinks. She also states that she has a history of guys that she was trying to just be friends with becoming interested in her. We go back and forth for a while and decides that she will stop talking to him and that‚Äôll be the end of that - or so I thought. 

Fast forward two months later to present day and I think the cycle is happening again. I‚Äôve woken up several times late night/early morning to her quickly closing out of messenger. 

I want to trust her so bad, but it‚Äôs hard. Am I being unreasonable? What should I do?

We are in the process of signing a lease for our first apartment together. I‚Äôm wondering if the anxiety is stemming from that or from these red flags. 

All other facets of our relationship are incredible which I causing the confusion. 

TLDR: Girlfriend talks to guys behind my back for months with no real resolution. We‚Äôve had extensive conversations about it but no signs of change. Wondering if the problem is her or me. 

Thanks"
dating_advice,"Every time I‚Äôm in a relationship, my self esteem goes down?","When I‚Äôm single and I‚Äôm dating around, I find that I‚Äôm super confident and I work out consistently and I value myself a lot. When I finally get into a relationship, it seems like I get so insecure about the little things with myself or with my partner and I and I don‚Äôt know why.

The guys I‚Äôve been with have been nothing but supportive and reassuring and loving, so I don‚Äôt really know where this insecurity comes from."
dating_advice,How to Break Things Off?,"I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for around nine months now, we‚Äôve been intimate, gone on plenty of dates, overall had a really good time together. But there have been times that he‚Äôs seemed distant or that he‚Äôs holding me at arms left which makes me feel like crap. For example, I‚Äôm always really into how his day has been going and listening to his problems but when it‚Äôs the other way round he doesn‚Äôt seem to care. He‚Äôs short with me or doesn‚Äôt make an effort to continue the conversation. It feels like I‚Äôm putting all the work in. 

For a while I‚Äôve been contemplating breaking it off, even though we aren‚Äôt technically in a relationship, but have held back because I feel like I‚Äôd have wasted my time speaking to him every single day since we met. Although I guess a red flag was him not jumping to commit. 

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back is something that happened recently. As you probably know, Valentine‚Äôs Day is coming up and if you want to do something like go to dinner then it has to be booked in advance. I asked him if he could get it off work and got a response of him being busy with work and that he‚Äôd rather go and party with his other single friends (also indicating that he‚Äôs single). This hurt but I brushed it off and just said okay - stupid, I know. 

The day after this I was speaking to a friend of mine who‚Äôs on the dating app Bumble and she‚Äôs telling me about this guy she‚Äôs speaking to and how sweet he is. Of course I ask to see him and imagine my surprise when she pulls out a picture of the guy I‚Äôve been seeing for nine months. She had no idea I was also seeing this guy, she‚Äôd only heard his name, and was horrified to find out he‚Äôd been seeing both of us. 

Am I stupid for expecting him to be seeing anyone else after such a long time together?

Regardless, I‚Äôm breaking it off with him. I just need some help wording this final goodbye in a mature way so I don‚Äôt have to speak to him again. I‚Äôm not up for ghosting because it has been done to me on many occasions and I know it hurts. 

I know this is pretty long but could you offer any help?"

dating_advice,How do I tell a guy No means no without making it awkward between us?,"I made a post here yesterday explaining a recent  situation where a guy that I‚Äôm dating kind of coerced me into having sex.

The sex itself was great and all but I‚Äôm really worried to make sex such a regular when we aren‚Äôt exclusive yet. (I can get very bonded to men I sleep with).

A lot of people mentioned he crossed a boundary and doesn‚Äôt respect me. It left me feeling a little worse than before a posted. Until one person said look maybe he thought it was a sexual game you were playing. Which looking back I could buy considering I‚Äôm incredibly flirty (look he‚Äôs very hot to me). Regardless I tried to stand up for myself and didn‚Äôt hold my ground. 

We planned to go to the movies this weekend and live out one of my sexual fantasies but since yesterday.. I‚Äôm feeling like things are a little too convenient for him. 

So... how do I show him I can hold firm ground? 

How do I have the conversation about boundaries at the BEGINNING of our next date (we don‚Äôt talk on the phone)? 

I‚Äôm thinking maybe me saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to living out my sexual fantasy with him might change things.. how do I change my mind and keep him interested? 

At a loss, because I really like him and it could have just been a misunderstanding. Need advice"
dating_advice,Age gap advice: creepy or not,"I recently went out to lunch with a way older guy I met at work (I'm 27, he's 55) and afterwards we agreed to meet up for drinks in the near future (no date set yet but he's been asking). The lunch was very innocent and no advancements were made by either of us. However he did mention going to his place to see his new deck, he paid for lunch, and I noticed he did touch me subtly towards the end of the date (on the arm, not sexually). 

Now I'm getting a little paranoid about the situation and feel I crossed an unsaid line. He's a regular at my work and I feel turning him down might make things messy.

Since having lunch he's been stopping by work more than normal, which gives me a predatory vibe now (since he knows my exact hours now).

I'm just looking for some advice on the situation.  Am I just bring paranoid now or would you feel the same way?

- Does this sound predatory to you? I feel the age gap alone is kinda red flag-ish.

-Have you ever had a ""relationship"" with someone significantly older than you?"

She sent him a message about it and he read it and blocked her. My other friend straight up lit his ass up in a Facebook message, to which he has not read yet. It‚Äôs all gotten out of hand.

dating_advice,mom vs boyfriend; really need some advice,"  

Hi Reddit. I need advice. I know this is a *really* long post but I wanted to include as many details as possible to get them off my chest. Tl;dr at the bottom. 

I (24F) am currently in a relationship of almost 9 months (with lots of flirting/getting to know each other before we started dating) with a super lovely man(27M). From our first date I have been attracted to him physically and mentally more than I have been to any other person. I have dated quite a bit, especially during college, and hadn‚Äôt felt a ‚Äúspark‚Äù with someone in so long. I was starting to think that my previous long term love had just sort of ruined me (it was a firey passionate unhealthy mess‚Ä¶lol) and that as I transitioned into adulthood I just would not get those butterflies for anyone else and settled in that department. I am also a *very* independent woman who is very career driven and often found myself wanting to be alone more than wanting to see the person I was dating, not knowing if I wanted to be in a committed relationship, wanting to be alone after one or two nights together, etc. Enter current bf and all of that melted away. He checks all of my boxes on paper (great STEM master‚Äôs degree, driven in his work, similar interests, etc) and in person we have a blast. We cannot get enough time with each other and sometimes will spend as much as 5 nights in a row with each other. He gets me and we are very much in love. He also fits in very well with my friends and I fit in with his. My one issue is that I am a very outgoing person and he is very introverted. I know this does not seem like a problem but I often finding myself wishing he was warmer with people such as waitstaff or new people we meet, or that he could interact alongside me more at parties and social events. It did not bother/worry me as much as it does now until the following issues arose. 

Enter the problem. My family, mainly my mother.

I love my mother very much, but she is hard to please and has never been a fan of people I have brought home. My whole life I have tried to please her and have done everything she could have really wanted from me honestly in terms of how I behaved, schooling, who I hung out with, etc. We have always had a VERY tight knit family and are very much involved in each other‚Äôs lives. I think she very much has the stigma of ‚Äúno one is good enough for my little girl‚Äù. She is also, as much as I hate to say it, a little racist. My current boyfriend is black, and it has been a point of tension with him since the first time she saw a picture of him. It is not so much that she has a problem with it, she has just had to deal with a lot of back lash from my very racist grand parents and blames me for having to deal with it. In addition, she is convinced that if we ever have kids they will be bullied for being mixed, that I will get caught up in a hate crime etc. Yes, these things are possible, but she also does not realize how open most people are now I haven‚Äôt had a single issue with any other friend, family member, coworker, etc.

We had a fight about it before she even met him where she expressed her concerns and I basically told her that it did not bother me so she needed to stop worrying and let it play out. She later met him three tines, once when we went to an event for my brother, a family event, and again when we all had dinner together. My brother said that she seemed to really like him and she expressed no concerns, asked about him every once in a while, helped me shop for a new watch for him for Christmas, and even bought him a gift herself. Then when he came to a family Christmas event to meet my extended family, he got there before me and was introduced to everyone. The time I was there he seemed to have a great time, and talked to everyone. My mother later told me when he first got there he came off as stand offish and rude (all of my extended family said they LOVED him) and how I deserved better, he needed to step it up, etc. I explained that he is quiet and was probably just very nervous especially since I was not there and she said that was no excuse. Then the race issues boiled up again and it turned into a huge blow out. Since then we have basically not talked about him. I slip in comments about how good he is to me or things we did and she either moves past it or says ‚Äúwell I am glad you are happy‚Äù in a shitty voice and changes the subject. My grandmother to this day does not like me dad who is the best man I know, and my mom always says how hard it was on her. So why she is doing this to me is beyond my understanding. Part of me feels like since everything she used to not like about guys (being a different religion, not having a good enough degree, me needing to focus on school, etc) **do not apply here she is just looking for something to dislike**. 

So here the main issue. I am worried about missing red flags due to previous bad relationships so I am letting my mom digging into the **one main flaw** that I see in my boyfriend worry me more than I should. Trust me, I KNOW that the answer is ‚Äúit is your life do not let her opinion effect you so much‚Äù but it is just eating at me so much. Typing this all out now I feel even more silly for letting this bug me, but I really hoped whoever I ended up with (I really think he is the one) would be able to fit in with my family well and be a part of everything. They have not seen each other since and it kills me how she will ask about my roomates girlfriend and how she is and not even about my own boyfriend.  P.S. my dad and I are very close and basically the same person and he likes him. 

**TL;DR My mom has very surface level issues with my boyfriend whom I love, and they are causing me to overthink the relationship and I do not know the best way to handle it. I know I am overreacting tbh but just am not handling it well (anyone with overly involved and demanding parents will understand)**"
dating_advice,So now what?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now. We are both 30 years old and when I asked him if he sees us getting married, his response was, ""I don't know but I understand if that doesn't work for you."" So my question is really, what does that mean? Do you think he is afraid of commitment or unsure about me?"
dating_advice,"Girls who've been hurt in previous relationships, were you hesitant about opening up to someone else? + a few other questions","There's a girl I've been talking to for the past month or so (we're part of a club on campus), she's clearly attracted to me, but she seems, I don't know how else to put it, guarded? Hesitant? Don't get me wrong, when I talk to her the conversation flows, but she's not the type to talk about her feelings, be confrontational, etc

For some context, she's super inexperienced when it comes to dating - she's only had one boyfriend, and they broke up over winter break because he cheated on her, caught in bed with another girl (they'd been together just over a year). She's really sweet, and I think she gets attached easily; when they were together she talked about him a lot, joined another organization because he did, would skip events with us to hang out with him, etc. So I can imagine just how much of a blow it was to her when she got cheated on

For what it's worth, I've been patient with her and haven't been pushy at all, and I've noticed that, even though it's been moving slow, there have been little signs of progress between us, and I just have this feeling that, with someone like her, patience, consistency and showing her that I'm not going to bail at the first bump in the road is the best way to go

So I just wanted to know, girls who've been in similar situations (or are just shy in general), were you hesitant about opening up to someone romantically, even though you liked them? Did it take you a long time to do so? What was it about the guy that eventually convinced you he was ""safe""? Anything else you'd like to share is appreciated"

dating_advice,Into my best friend‚Äôs older brother,"I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs and into my best friend‚Äôs older brother. I have no idea if he‚Äôs into me or if he thinks of me as a sister. (to clarify we only met a few years ago). 

Sometimes it seems like he is. When we‚Äôre together we‚Äôre always joking around - two peas in a pod. We only met a few years ago and it feels like I‚Äôve known him forever. When we met he had a girlfriend but we had talked on the phone a few times and commented on each other‚Äôs social media. He didn‚Äôt seem to pay attention to his gf at all - we talked a lot. 

Once when his sister and I stayed at his place he didn‚Äôt want me to fall asleep, so we could stay up and hang, so he made me coffee and then when I did fall asleep he literally grabbed a blanket and tucked me in.

Even his sister has commented on how close we are. We all were at a wedding together and he could tell I was kind of left out so he invited me to dance with him and his mom and grandma. We ended up dancing together a lot.

After we see each other he will spend a few days texting me a ton and then it slowly fades. Lately he‚Äôs been dating this new girl and he completely stopped communicating with me. I met her recently (I live far away for now) and it was weird - her and I got along but he and I barely made eye contact. 

Idk if you can even tell from this but I can‚Äôt really talk to my friend about it bc she gets weird about her brother. Even just typing this is therapeutic."
dating_advice,"The more I show indiference, The more I attract..","To be honest, I'm really interested by people, specificaly by their backstories. When I meet someone, I ask lots of questions about their lives, we have so much to learn of others experiences. 

So, by doing this, I put lots of attention on the person. I'm curious and sure it's a very good thing. But the fact is, I realized it's not the best way to flirt with new people. I put lots of efforts metting new people, and I had enough of bad results (make lots of friends for sure, but not in a seductive way).

Naturaly, I told myself : ""Fuck, let's be a little more selfish and talk more about yourself."" In a good way of course. So, I show less attention on girl I want to flirt with : Just having a good time, without too much thinking, talking about my experiences and asking Times to Times questions about her. (We are not savage..)

And, what happened here ? Flirts with girls became easier and more frequently. With less efforts wtf.. If I had know this earlier.. :)

Conclusion : It's a GOOD thing to show interest in people you are interested in, but it's also CRUCIAL to not show too much attention. Show also who you are. You are an interesting person, it's exactly for this reason people will like you. Open to others.

Also, I'm a kind guy, maybe ""too kind"" sometimes, but it's me, and I don't want to loose my singularity and my curiosity. Just be yourself, you will attract good people for you."
dating_advice,Would you date a woman your brother hooked up with?,"I am the female in this, I had a fling with a guy and it ended a while ago. We will call him Ben.

But last year I ended up sleeping with Ben - one drunk night and have felt terribly. 

And didn‚Äôt think I had a chance with Ben, because he said he only wanted to be friends. Fast forward a few months and out of the blue Ben wants to see me and we hangout and do our thing.

dating_advice,How do you get back after texting a woman too much?,"There's this woman I've been speaking with long distance. We first met in real life, went separate ways, have met in person a few times after, but now live far away again. We've been texting and calling for months now, but I think the distance has made me over-communicate at times, by sometimes double-texting. Unfortunately, I've realized she has been going distant recently, despite everything going great just before that. She said she's been occupied with her studies and work, but my fear is that she might have been overwhelmed by my communication - she earlier on said that she's not a big texter. I just figured out regular texting would be the best way to keep in touch with the distance.

What can I do in this situation? Any way I can fix it?"

dating_advice,How to find an AWESOME partner,"Yesterday I made a post that sex &amp; dating shouldn't be your solution to emptiness.

[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ev6sx9/sex_dating_shouldnt_be_your_solution_to_emptiness/) My underlying point was you shouldn't see a relationship as a cure for not loving yourself.

But let's say you do love yourself, and you're ready to find further happiness in a relationship. Here's what I recommend:

**Get out**

I know this is extremely obvious, but it's getting easier and easier to sit at home and not go out and be active. Sitting at home and playing settlers of Catan with your couple friends isn't going to get you to meet someone. Start pushing yourself to be more social **outside** your existing circle. Join a meetup group, a facebook event, a yoga class, start a new social hobby or even take initiative and tell friends to go out for karaoke and for them to bring friends, just start finding more ways to be social.

**Just say something**

We usually over worry about what to say or how to say it to the point that we never end up speaking to the person or forgetting that they are just human. Take initiative and introduce yourself or talk about something in the immediate environment just to get the ball rolling. You'd be surprised as to how low the bar is to getting a conversation going, you don't need a magical line.

**Be fun to be around**

Some people are just downers. They complain about everything, bring the mood down, and no one really wants to be around them. You don't have to do backflips to be fun to be around. Bring the spirit of the conversation up, make jokes, tell stories, even if you're a good listener, just be the person that people would actually want to see again.

**Make your intentions clear**

I don't mean spell it out word for word. I mean if someone is looking in and sees you guys talking, they should be able to tell that it's more of a flirtatious conversation and not just 2 friends catching up. We often fear rejection so much that we walk on egg shells just to make sure the conversation goes as OK as possible. Just because ""Well it was nice meeting you"" isn't a rejection, doesn't mean it's a good thing. It means you didn't make an attempt to move things forward by asking for a date, or a number or anything past what's happening and this person is now walking out of your life. If you like them, make an effort.

**Have a filtering standard**

Don't just settle for the first person that you meet. Beauty can be blinding and sometimes when we're in a scarcity mindset, we latch onto the first person we go on a date with and assume that this person is a great match. We will often ignore blatant red flags while thinking that this person can be the one. If you set a standard, and say to yourself I'm looking for these qualities and won't settle for someone who doesn't meet them (without being overly picky for the sake of being picky) then you're saving yourself time and potential heartache.

**Don't be in a rush**

Don't let yourself get frustrated that you aren't finding someone. It's better to take a little bit longer to find someone who is awesome, than it is to settle for someone who really isn't that great and then you feel trapped in a mediocre relationship. Be patient, you'll find the person if you're getting yourself out there, it's just a matter of time."
dating_advice,Cougar relationship,"Hey guys
25 M here ..wanting to date an older woman..many married women Ping me...should I proceed further??"
dating_advice,Do I reach out or wait for him?,"I met a guy at the weekend I really like, we hit it off instantly, had a ton of chemistry and lots of personality traits in common (in a good way!)

We exchanged a few messages on the Saturday and Sunday (he reached out to me) and he said he wanted to see me again when he was back from holiday (he left on Monday for a week). 

Only thing is I‚Äôm now worried a week away with friends will make him forget me and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since Sunday - should he have text me by now to check in? 
What if he doesn‚Äôt message me when he returns? Should I reach out to him or will he contact me if he‚Äôs interested? 

Whilst this might seem straightforward or that I‚Äôm over worrying, the spanner in the works is that he split up from a long term gf (4 years) 2 months ago so I don‚Äôt want to seem overbearing as I assume he needs space... but I definitely want to see him again.

We met up for coffee earlier today and it was super awkward. Some silences here and there and it was like talking to a stranger. I like him a lot but I‚Äôm scared that when we go on another date tomorrow it will be really awkward. We‚Äôre not going to be sat down at a table so I‚Äôm sure it will be fine but I‚Äôm not sure.

dating_advice,I'm(24M) seeing a girl(21F) but I'm not sure about her,"

So, I break up with my ex(with who I stayed for just 1-2 month, but it was very intense)  and after a week I went out for a date with a new girl because it would help me forget my ex and also she looked interesting.
So we met in a bar, we talked for 2/3 hours, then we went to my house and we passed the night together, we watched various videoe and films.
When we went to sleep after a while we started kissing, the day after we spent some other time together and we had sex.
Some day after we met again and spent another whole day together.
(We met the first time 2 week ago and we met 2 times)


The problem is this, she looks a very interesting person, she's also very sweet and cute, has a nice face, but I don't like her body(has a few extra pounds) and I don't feel mentally involved even If I like her personality and I'm good when I'm with her.
I think she likes me, she said she felt really good with me.

I don't know what to do now, I don't want to say bullshit to her because I know it could hurt her and it. I want to be honest, but I don't know how, I want to keep seeing her and I don't want to deceive her and also I don't want to offend or make her sad.

What do you advice me to do?

(Sorry for my english, I don't know if it is decent)

TL;DR: I'm dating a girl a week after have had a break up, I'm good when I'm with her, she likes me, but I don't like her body and I'm not mentally involved."
dating_advice,How do I get a girlfriend if im shy?,I got really depressed today because im 19 and never had a girlfriend before. Ive been single my whole life :( You probably wonder why. Basically what happened is I got bullied throughout middle/high school for having a dark skin complexion because i grew up in an all white suburban area in the south. so because of this it gave me really low self esteem and confidence in myself so ive never been able to approach girls in fear of them thinking im ugly. back in high school i got called ugly a lot by a few dudes and they used to always laugh at me whenever they saw me. i just wish that shit never happened to me cause it destroyed my self esteem and i cant even approach girls im attratced to. i might have to get an escort :(

I m (F26) recently got rejected by my crush (F27) to a party I asked her to go. However, I am wondering if it would be possible in the future to ask her out again and she would agree, giving her time and space and working on myself too.

dating_advice,"Last night my (??F) date lied to me (22M) and looked nothing like her pictures and also reminded me of past abuse, so I ordered an angel shot","I am a 22M and met up with a ?20's? F. We met on Tinder and agreed to see each other at a local bar to get a drink.

I arrived and waited and waited but no one came to my table. Finally I got a text saying ""where are you? I've been waiting here for 20 minutes"". I said ""where are you"".

She instructed me to which part of the bar she was sitting in. I looked over and instantly felt my gut wrench.

She was the same girl in the photos on Tinder, but plus about 150 pounds and aged about 10 years. She must have used photos from college and maybe lied about her age on Tinder (which I think is connected to Facebook?).

I sat down and we introduced myself and we talked for a few minutes but she honestly really creeped me out and I couldn't get over the lying about pictures.

What I mean by ""creeped out"" is I had a very very very bad life experience that consumed my existence for two years as a teenager, where my girlfriend at the time was really into extreme horror movies. As in snuff films and things like that. She would make me watch them with her. I tried to leave when she started abusing me but it was just an awful toxic situation and I had to get a restraining order. When my current date started mentioning them, I tried steering the conversation away but she kept coming back to it. This was an interest that was NEVER in her bio or brought up in our convos prior. Now that I think about it, this was more of a factor of why I felt unsafe and a little less of the fact of her lying about pictures and stuff.

I remembered that a good female friend of mine told me that there are often signs in the women's bathroom saying if your date isn't who you expected them to be or is going wrong that you can walk to the bar and order an angel shot, where they will basically usher you out the back door and call a ride if you need one.

I made pretend like I had to use the bathroom and I went up to the bar and ordered an ""angel shot"". The bartender gave me a funny look like ""uhh what? you?"" but I said ""yes please one angel shot"". She said ""uh ok one moment please"" and returned five minutes later while I awkwardly stood at the bar trying to hide myself and trying to not turn around and look back at my date.

When she returned she said ""our manager has agreed that we can help you. please follow me"". They took me out the back door and I walked around to my car and left.

I did offer but the woman who escorted me told me not to worry about it because it was too much of a hassle to figure out which order I was and take payment and all of that when I should probably just get going. TBH she wasn't very friendly and seemed more annoyed that she had to step away from her job to assist me.

It was mentioned on another post that I should get therapy for my past abuse and I definitely agree. I guess what I'm wondering is if its ok to keep dating or should I take time off and work on my own issues? It was also mentioned that I abused a system meant to keep women safe and for that I am truly sorry. I won't be doing it again."
dating_advice,need advice for dating after an abusive relation,"first of all, english is not my first language.

I am 21 and 1,5 years ago I left an abusive relationship. I have refused to make more emotional contact with people since then.

two weeks ago I met this girl when I went to buy some stuff at a toystore for some lego's I needed. she works there and she was so friendly. she helped me get all I needed and ringed me up. at the register she needed my name for an action, and for an enquete she gave me her first name.

that evening she added me on social media and I confirmed her request and since then we have been texting. I feel for the first time in a long time a connection with someone. I asked her on a date yesterday and in a few days we have a date. I am exided but also anxious. I have realy bad anxiety and I dont wanna ruin what we have now.

do you have any tips for me?"
dating_advice,Can‚Äôt tell if friend (21/F) likes me (21/M) more than just a friend,"So I have been friends with this girl for about 2 years now. Recently, we have gotten closer and been talking every day for the past month and hung out/ studied together a handful of times. When we hang out things have been great, and we have a lot in common. She‚Äôs known in our friend group as being a little awkward but she really opens up around me and I don‚Äôt find the time we spend together awkward at all. 

The problem is, I really don‚Äôt know how she feels about me, if it‚Äôs just friendship or more. I find when we text, a lot of the time she mostly talks about herself. She‚Äôll ask questions sometimes, but if I ever talk about what I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôll get a ‚Äúoh cool, so anyway this is what I‚Äôm doing....‚Äù I would say she reaches out during text more than I do, but mostly to tell me what she‚Äôs doing. I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs just lonely and looking for someone to talk to or maybe it‚Äôs something more. 

She talks to me far more than she does to anyone else in our friend group, and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a sign of anything. I really do like her and spending time with her, but I don‚Äôt really know how to bring it up without ruining a friendship or making things awkward. Any advice is appreciated!!!"
dating_advice,What dating app serves best in finding serious relationships or mature people?,"I‚Äôm thinking of getting back into the dating world and as overwhelming as it may seem now, I feel that I‚Äôve spent a lot of years working on myself and I‚Äôm ready to put myself up for short term painful rejections in return for a long lasting fulfilling relationship.

dating_advice,Where would it be acceptable to hit on a girl?,"I(20M) broke up with my ex last summer and since then I've been working on myself (working out, appearances etc.). Because I'm now completely over her, I figured it might be time to hit the dating scene again. Because I don't really go to bars or clubs regularly I started using dating apps in december. Since then, I've been on 2 dates which both didn't really lead to anything (apart from a kiss). Don't get me wrong, I know it shouldn't always have to lead to something, but I feel that if you see someone you should be able to determine whether you want to shoot your shot at someone or not.

dating_advice,Should I (32f) ask him (30m) to be my sport buddy?,"Hi!

I had dated a guy for several times. We matched on Tinder but we used to work in the same place (he didn't know that till I told him on our first date that we were colleagues). We talked a lot, teased each other a lot, walked and saw several new places together. Our first kiss was on the fifth date when we were sitting on the beach. It was amazing. It flowed naturally and turned to be goddamn hot on the next date. I felt like we were so passionately into each other. And it felt so mutual until he hugged me and said to me that: ""You know, I am not looking for a girlfriend. I enjoy being single!!!!""

I told him that I didn't expect much from him but why didn't he let it an open option for both of us in the future? He and I used to give each other's opinion on dating, friendship and marriage. We know that we are chasing the similar goals, working hard, saving up for a house and kids, pursuing a healthy lifestyle, etc. I think obviously I am better than his ex gf of 2 months because she asked him for money when I didn't. 
I told him that I didn't want to stay like this. I don't rush into relationship with him but since he saw no future with me, he should let me go. He said he still wanted me as his friend (I am not sure if he just tried to be nice after all or our friendship does matter to him). I answered him that I would think about it because I couldn't keep seeing him without feeling for him.

So it has been several days after he told me he didn't want a girlfriend. We stopped texting since then. I become missing his companion and start thinking about asking him to be my sport buddy. I know it's a bit adventurous for me because every time we meet, the physical chemistry is so strong and it leads to sex which is not good for me because I hate casual sex, fwb or something like that.

No other friends of mine are up for some outdoor activities. So I really want to do it with him like once a week. I think about telling him my boundaries before we can do stuff like that (He is honest and straightforward. So am I. That is why we got along great.) At the same time, I am so afraid of myself doing stupid things that would make me feel regret later. But then I am like, I only live once, why I should be afraid so much. Moreover, I may leave this town for good in the near future and I expect to enjoy healthy activities with him in this town before I leave. That should be all. Nothing more. But I am quite indecisive about that. 

Any comments are appreciated! Many thanks!"
dating_advice,23F ‚Äì What am I doing wrong?,"For many reasons, I never dated in my teens like everyone else. However when I was 20, I downloaded tinder for the first time. Since then I have tried various dating apps. I have been on approximately 30 dates and I still haven‚Äôt got a relationship after almost 3 years of looking‚Äì what am I doing wrong?

Ever since I started using bumble last year I have been on around 8 dates and most do not pass a first date. When I was on tinder, I was more successful at getting a second or third date. To be honest I‚Äôm really shocked at my lack of success and I need some help figuring out what my problem is. 

I am fairly attractive (probably a 7 out of 10), my body is ok (BMI is 25, on the average/overweight borderline but I‚Äôm fairly well endowed), I‚Äôm tall, intelligent (go to one of the best unis in the world), and I am popular with lots of friends. I just don‚Äôt understand why this doesn‚Äôt resonate with my love life. 

The closest I ever got to a relationship was from an app a year ago. He was just out of a long term relationship and we dated for 2 months. However, when I told him I wanted a relationship, he ended it with me because ‚Äòhe wasn‚Äôt sure what he wanted and didn‚Äôt want to lead me on‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs difficult to meet men in real life as my uni course is very female-dominated and most of my friends are girls so I tend to rely on the apps. I don‚Äôt struggle to get matches by any means and get dates easily compared to my other friends. 

The last few dates I have been on, I am often shocked that after some seemingly really good dates which involved hours deep in conversation and laughing, these guys tell me that they didn‚Äôt feel any chemistry and/or there was no spark, but got along with me well in a ‚Äòfriends‚Äô way. In around three quarters of these dates, the guy has kissed me at the end, and/or said he wanted to meet up again, but then ghost me after. In a quarter of these dates, I have had guys organise a 2nd date, for them to cancel and not contact me again. In the other quarter, I get ghosted entirely. Most of these guys offer to pay for the date too, and I am often complimented on the dates and I have been told that I am better than expected compared to my dating profile. Can someone please shed a light into what is happening here? I do acknowledge that some men were interested in pursuing me further, although these were men that I was not interested in. 

I have discussed this with my friends who often blame hook-up culture, and although I feel this does have somewhat of a role, it is not the main problem. I‚Äôve also been told that most guys want a girly girl and it‚Äôs going to be harder to find someone who likes me as I‚Äôm more tomboy/dominant in terms of my personality. I still wear makeup/do my hair/dress nice though! My auntie is probably the most honest person I can approach, however I am not sure if she is educated enough with modern dating culture to give an accurate perspective. She proposes that my ‚Äòdesperation‚Äô for a relationship is making me try too hard during dates with people I like and is making me subconsciously behave too full-on, giving bad vibes. This could be true as I suffer from quite severe anxiety due to this issue, and I also have depression and OCD. However, I feel that as I have had these conditions for a while, I have learned to hide my symptoms from people and appear relatively normal and can fake being confident/happy/charismatic/chill. I have been told by my peers that I seem very confident so it seems to be working. Am I fooling myself? 

Another potential reason could be that I am still a virgin. Maybe I lack sexual energy and am not flirtatious enough to create a spark on a first date? My friends have suggested for me to have a ONS/FWB and get it out the way however I am a romantic at heart and I would feel used, especially if the guy didn‚Äôt want to take things further.

This is affecting me a lot - I feel like I am not a real woman, and it‚Äôs a huge blow to my self-esteem. Also, I am really craving intimacy and a romantic connection. I honestly don‚Äôt see a way out of this and feel I am destined to be alone forever. I went on a date yesterday with a guy who I had a tonne in common with and felt a genuine connection with, and the same thing happened again which left me devastated. I am aware my OCD has made me obsessed with finding a boyfriend, and it‚Äôs stopping me from focusing on anything else.

I would really appreciate some advice or your opinion as to what is really happening, as I am really confused."

dating_advice,I (19F) haven't ever dated and don't feel the need to. Am I normal?,"I (19F) grew up as a chubby child, had a hard time due to bullying. Never really felt cute or did any boy show me any attention growing up. I'm not ugly nor am I the prettiest. I'm right in the middle. 

Last year I lost a considerable amount of weight. I've received many compliments. I'm socially awkward and still don't get any boy attention or notice. 

As a result, I matured in building my character and don't feel like I really need to date for the sake of dating. Though I would've liked if any boy would pay attention just so I could proof myself that's possible somehow. 

Am I normal? Why Boys don't notice me?"
dating_advice,Afraid to meet my crush,"Sorry for my bad english:(

I (M22) have been single for 6 months.  As a reaction to the separation, I met a friend for sex directly, which was very uncomfortable afterwards.  Afterwards I wasn't interested in anyone and actually ignored all women.  After 2 months I started to get interested in women again.
 I met a woman at school and I really like her.  I then invited her on a date and she agreed.  I canceled the first date because I was afraid of something.  I had a good excuse and she didn't notice.  Now I just canceled the 2nd date because I got scared again.  Before that, I cut off contact with other women because I didn't want to meet them for any reason.

 I cannot explain this to myself.  I used to be very confident and it was no problem for me to meet someone.  Now I can only meet my long-time friends.  I don't lose a single thought about my ex, I don't care about her.  I do not know how to continue.  Does anyone of you have an idea how I can meet women again? This is a huge problem for me and I feel very sad because of this."
dating_advice,So if a guy is wearing one of those wire plastic scrunchy thing that lifeguards use for their whistles. Does that mean they‚Äôre taken?,I assume he is because he doesn‚Äôt have long hair. :(
dating_advice,"I feel like a catch, but i still struggle with girls?","Anyone else feel like they're a catch but struggling with relationships? Im(22M) not a model or anything but i feel like im more attractive than most guys. I get plenty of compliments on my appearance, though when i look in the mirror there are quite  a few things that make me self-conscious. I'm fairly social, kind  and well-tempered and im pursuing a career in engineering. I'm also pretty fit and exercise regularly. Besides the fact that im short, which honestly doesn't feel like a downside to me anymore. I don't understand why it's so difficult for me to find a healthy relationship. It's not that I have no one interested in me. But the girls i try my luck with never seem to work out.


I just go off wondering if there's still anything i can do to improve because i feel like i already ticked the boxes, especially from what i expect from myself. But i still feel a little jealous when i go do my grocery shopping and i see so many happy couples, even with the amount of effort i put in to asking girls out or working on my social skills. I have good friends and people who care about me but romance is just something i dont have. 


Though as single as i am, i feel like im doing things right. I'm trying my hardest to better my own life, going after all the things i want and confronting the fears i have that are in my way. Though this feeling starts diminishing, when im hit with the reality that people around me have life better than i do walking around with their partners, enjoying each others company. 



Id like to fall in love with someone who deeply cares about me because ive never experienced it before. I think i need to be patient with this, as i know that expecting someone to commit the time and energy to another being is a huge leap. It's just bitter, not knowing if this patience and hard work is gonna pay off, and although i think im on the right track, doubt still plagues my mind."
dating_advice,Did she give me a fake number or did she accidentally mistype?,"Sorry if this post seems immature at all but I‚Äôm new to dating.

I (20m) asked a girl (20f) if she wanted to get coffee. We‚Äôve known each other on a friendly level (but never exchanged numbers) and both participate in a Christian fellowship at our uni. She seemed initially excited and quick to say yes when i asked her, and seemed kinda flirty. I asked for her number and she put it in but i didn‚Äôt text her immediately (so she would have my number, (maybe this was dumb of me, I guess I wasn‚Äôt thinking right)). Well anyways I said ‚Äúcool I‚Äôll text you then‚Äù and we said bye and parted ways. 

Well anyways, one of the apps that I use syncs your contacts and I saw that the person who‚Äôs number matched up to the number she gave me was not her. Obviously, I was disappointed but also confused cause I wouldn‚Äôt think she would do something like that. I remembered that Facebook had the feature where friends can view your phone number and I saw that the number indeed was different - the last digit was off. It was a ‚Äú3‚Äù instead of a ‚Äú6‚Äù, so there is a chance that she mistakenly mistyped it, but there is a chance that she gave me a fake number cause she didn‚Äôt want to say no/didn‚Äôt want me to contact her. Maybe I‚Äôm just being hopeful but I really thought she was genuinely interested but I guess she could have been faking it. If she did give me a fake number, yes I would be disappointed but I would not be upset with her at all. 

So yeah I got kinda blindsided. Did she give me a fake number, or did she mistakenly mistype her number?"
dating_advice,Not sure how to really respond to this or what it means? help?,"I basically opened up to this guy I like from work and I don't know how to respond..(and before anyone goes on a tangent about workplace dating, our store doesn't frown on that nor does my boss)

Me: ""Yeah. Not sure why I feel so comfortable around you. Part of the reason maybe being that I don't see you as a co-worker even though we are ""
Him: ""Huh, we are friends too, you're right. I was just thinking today about how I was glad you got hired and stayed at our store. I would have been bummed if you went to a different spot haha""

Me: ""Lol. Yeah, I didn't think I would enjoy the people as much as I do. So lax and fun. Its a good fit for me I think.
If I were to be bold, we are friends but the interest of something more has perked in my head from time to time. Not to make you uncomfortable, but I don't lie.""

Him: ""I have thought about something more than just friendship too. If you dont mind me asking what would be the next like step? ""

Cue, uh, ne now. Next 'like' step? Does that even mean?"
dating_advice,Feeling a bit lost,"So, first time posting, so forgive me if I ramble.
I, 29M, am, I feel, at the end of the road with my girlfriend, 29F.
I have been lonely for months, and I feel that we don‚Äôt have things in common anymore. Furthermore, I feel like I‚Äôm walking on egg shells when we have conversations. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm scared to be alone... In other words, I‚Äôm a bit messed up. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant."
dating_advice,Is his ex crazy or is he not making it clear enough?,"I (F27) have been dating a guy (M40) for 2 months now, in wich we have been seeing each other pretty much everydays, we hang out togheter, we have met our respective families i have a daughter (F3) who he has met too and he seems great with her so far, we pretty much have what you could say is a ""on going serious relationship"" except we still haven't stated the ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" title. The thing is when we met he was seeing this girl wich didn't had enough time for him as they leave kind of far away and her job is very time consuming and she wasn't really putting enough effort into the relationship, long story short, he had told me about this and the fact that he wasn't happy with it and wanted another kind of relationship as he was ready for a more commited relationship (He hasn't been married and wants to be a father). When we began dating he kind of broke the previous relationship and the ex went crazy, she now wants to get him back, now she swears she'll change, she will be all that she wasn't during the time they had, etc... In one point she found out about me last month and wrote me on SM telling me how he still loved her, that i'm just a rebound, that they are meant to be togheter etc... thing that pulled me off a little, but he swore he didn't wanted to lose me or lose what we were creating so i told her and she told me she wouldn't back off. Him and i continued to get to know each other, spending as much time as you can think about it together, going out on trips and such, now yesterday we went out having something to eat when she begins to call him on his cellphone, and he didn't answered (twice) i obviously got uncomfortable and asked him why he didn't answered wich he replied saying they haven't talked for so long that he doesn't feel there's nothing to talk about (in my mind it was due to my presence) and i texted her saying what did she needed... and it began again, she told me he texted her the previous day, and they text regularly, that they throw away a letter i had made for him for Christmas (wich made me feel completely violated) and many other provocative things she says as always... When i asked him about the letter he told me it was in his room, and when he went looking for it he said it's not in the envelope, but he swears he would never do as she said, but when he went on a worktrip about 3 weeks ago, she did said to him she needed to go and get some ""important documents"" she had left in his room, and as he was abroad he told her to get in touch with his brother to go and pick them up (Wich i didn't know Nothing about, until now) I just can't with this anymore, he doesn't do ANYTHING to stop her toxicity, and i don't know what to think anymore, i told him he either STOPS it or i won't move any further with this, he isn't sure of what to do to put an end to it, or is he not willing to do it? i'm confused and don't want to be played with any further, thougths?? i would really appreciate it"
dating_advice,boyfriend of one year still talks to his girlfriend in prison. not sure if i should still be okay with this or move on w/ my life?,"before i start, hes 26 male and im 21 female. he has his own place and i still live at home. both not in school, both work almost same amount of hours. we are both not close with our families. nor do we have lots of friends

when me and my boyfriend met in may 2019, i had a boyfriend at the time. met through a mutual friend, and found out we had lots in common. i didnt think of pursuing a relationship with him, but i was attracted. around november 2019 i left my boyfriend at the time for using tinder. very shortly after me and my current boyfriend rekindled and became friends. 

we went out on dates, and hung out every single day. one night he had explained to me how his most recent girlfriend (of only a few months together) got locked up for 8 years... i felt horrible for him, i cried with him. as time went on, the more we liked each other, the more we spent more time together. he bought me gifts, started introducing me to some friends he had, and a family member.

one night her calls began, and he would leave the room just to talk to her. every time. around january he got a tattoo of her initials on his arm without me knowing. i nicely told him how this is making me uncomfortable. i tried to break up, but he wouldnt let me. he always said it had nothing to do with me. and he agreed that it wasnt right and he wont answer phone calls as much anymore, knowing he has a girlfriend taking him seriously, not just a fling.

as time went on, he continued his calls with her when i wasnt around. however he lied saying hed stop talking to her. thats what i didnt appreciate. he feels guilt for her because he puts himself in her shoes. 

around august 2019 he began hiding his phone, taking it to the bathroom, every where with him. leaving the phone face down. i never look through his phone. but this behavior made me curious. one night he left his phone around me and in december 2019 i found out he had been talking to an ex from years ago, and they were sexting. i was FURIOUS!!! all the things i dealt with! and now he was talking to his ex about what??? 

anyways, i tried to break it off for good. no matter what he doesnt let me go. he has no one. no friends, no family to rely on, no one. he lives by himself. saying how much he loves me and cried to me. after a year of being together and me finding out he was cheating, he posts me on social media. for the firs time. he did everything i wanted him to do in the first place.

so i took him back. the phone issues stopped, he left it around, left it face up, wasnt weird about it. as weeks went on (here we are) the phone issues began... again. so i was truly curious this time. i looked while he was takinf a shower and turns out he emails the girl in jail... i read through some of them saying hes not going anywhere, hell be right here, he misses her so much, and he loves her. and on my birthday he said he wishes she was with him..... 

whenever i confront him now, he says to stay out of it, and that he will not be controlled. i want to leave but its extremely difficult to. im on his phone plan (i forgot to bring my ID to tmobile) so he never switched it over to me. i wanna run away and never turn back. but part of me is guilty that hes alone and so troubled. i feel like he might kill himself without me. he goes through so much. i dont know what to do. please be honest with me. i care about him but after all this i cant stop thinking about his ex and the ex in jail... i wanna be the only girl....."
dating_advice,Went on a second date and didnt go for a kiss even though we had sex on the first...,"Hi there

I went on a date with a girl a few months ago. We had a few drinks and it was fun. One thing led to another and we ended up having sex at hers. 

I thought the sex was quite passionate and i felt a connection, but after she got kind of anxious and was frantically tidying her room, so i made sure she was all right and left.

I tried to meet her again, but she kept saying she was too busy, so i dropped it. She seemed quite sincere with her reasons, but whether shes busy or not it seemed like a dead end.

A few months went by and i got back in touch cos i was quite enamoured by her and we met up again. She suggested we go for dinner. We didnt drink this time cos she said wasnt drinking to be healthy and do anything dum.

I thought the dinner was fun and we had good chat. However, all of the above being on my mind made me a little weary and i sppose didnt give me much confidence. I kinda didnt think it would be appropriate to kiss/couldnt find the right moment and at the end of the night she kissed me on the cheap and we parted.

Now i feel quite pathetic for not making a move despite having had sex during the last encounter! What does not making a move say about me? Would it put her off me? I keep thinking - nobody likes a wimp!

I feel i should probs drop it but i quite like her (im not some chump who likes anyone who gets with me!).

I would appreciate any thoughts on my lack of action, as well as, any general comments!

Thanks so much!"
dating_advice,I (20F) don't know if the man (28M) that I'm dating is hiding things from me. Too early to worry?,"I'm currently dating a man who I met while he was working as a doorman at a nightclub. We exchanged numbers, I have since seen him twice, and have been talking to just under two months.

It's very early, I'm completely aware and conscious of that, and I by no means want to be distrusting when things have barely started. The problem is, he's neglecting to tell me his surname.

He told me during a date that he had not too long ago separated with his long term partner, and mother of his three children, as she was cheating on him. He advised he's still in an adjustment period, organising financials, custody etc. He advised that because of this, he's not looking to rush into anything too serious, and wants to take things slowly.

This is fine with me, as I too haven't been single very long, and I would like to take things slow, providing there will eventually be an opportunity for more.

The first doubts arose when speaking to friends, and they made a joke that since he's busy often that he's probably married. I was speaking about him to my mum as we're like best friends, and when I mentioned that his partner cheated on him, she said 'Ahh they all say that' which I brushed off as a joke.

I have him on instagram, however his full name isn't shown on his profile, and despite us texting and seeing each other over the last month and a half, he still hasn't followed me back. Again, I didn't put this down to anything other than him maybe not really caring too much about social media.

On another occasion where we were making conversation, I asked the names of his children to show interest. He said 'the anonymous three' and wouldn't tell me, which I understood at the time as we didn't know each other very well yet. He just said he would tell me 'in time'.

I didn't start to get really suspicious until I told him after our second date that I still didn't know his surname. He responded by saying 'that's how I like it'. This seemed very odd to me, and it does seem as though he doesn't want me to be able to find him on social media. Personally I would never think to hide my own surname unless I had something to hide, but then I'm not sure if that's a generational thing or if I'm right.

Unless he's a secret millionaire, and I doubt it since he's working as a bouncer, I feel like I don't know if I'm looking too far into things considering how early on everything is. Or if I'm right to be suspicious, so I thought I'd come to the trusty reddit to see what advice you guys would give?"
dating_advice,My recent (28F) boyfriend (28M) is too infatuated with me ever since we got into a relationship. What to do?,I‚Äôm also starting to feel he is too involved in my life because he likes me more than I like him now. What can I do to help the situation? Is giving space and time going to help this or make the longing from him more? I find I like my space and own time and he wants to connect at all times. Starting to feel like it might not work out if this continues and I‚Äôm not sure how you guys have dealt with this in the past.
dating_advice,M21 When should I drop a text,"Yesterday I kind of went out with a girl, and she went for a kiss, we were both kind of drunk. We continued chatting and she searched more and more kisses. Then we came back when we lived and continued the kissing but more aggressively. Then she said she had to go to her room so I asked her if I should go with her, she said no but continued kissing me and this went for at least an hour or so, she kept kissing me, but ultimately went to her room an nothing happened. I asked for advice to a friend and told me to go search her, she didn‚Äôt open the door. While kissing she said she wanted to take things slow. Now the thing is that I would like to know when I could drop a text and what can I say?"
dating_advice,She still has not reply to my last chat message and its been more than 2 days already,"Hello! So I have a crush on this girl and we are just acquiantance. Last week, we went on a huge conference event that lasted 2 days. We both already knew each other before the conference event. I knew she would come because I messaged her last time that I will go and she told me she would also go to that conference. We told each other that see you on the conference event.

We bumped each other during the course of breaks in that conference, said hi to each other. But we did not really talk much in person because she was with her friends and I was also busy by that time and I'm with my friends. After the conference event last Saturday, I messaged her on how was the conference. We chatted a bit and had a good conversation but she really took a long time to reply to my last chat messages.

Well one time her best friend offered me a ride home last time. Only 2 of us in the car. Then she kept pushing me on telling her on who is my crush. She also told me that if I tell her who is my crush, she will help me to set up on that person she knows

Well, I only know one common friend of her best friend and its her who is my current crush. Sooo yeah that is what I thought. My crush also invited me to an event before I message her.

Sooo yeah, right now idk if my crush likes me because I only know one common friend that I interact with and which is her

Like after I mentioned my crush name in a car in a casual conversation, she pauses a bit then she answered. And like afterwards she kept pushing me who is my crush

So yep, she did not reply back to my last chat message. Its been more than 48 hours and idk what happened. Idk if I am just overthinking this but I don't want to think ill thoughts about her ghosting me or something. Any opinions?"
dating_advice,Do phone calls work better than texting?,"Long story short I used to go out with this girl like 2 years ago. We‚Äôve known each other since we were kids and I blew my chances with her cause I thought we lived ‚Äútoo far‚Äù from each other. 

During the 2 years we broke things off we were still friends and just talked every once in a while. Such as commenting on stories/posts etc. 

Now I want to try to get back with her and I started talking to her a bit and eventually asked her to hang out and she said that she would love to. 

Supposed to see her this weekend and she said she‚Äôd let me know what day and I recently started texting her so we can just remain in contact before we hangout but we talked for a bit through iMessage and she left me on read to messages that could still be replied to. 

So now I‚Äôm CONFUSED I don‚Äôt know whether to call her and ask her how she‚Äôs doing and if we are gonna still hangout or text her or not even say anything at all since she didn‚Äôt respond??"

dating_advice,"I need advice with a tinder girl, please","Hello, i'm a 23 year old male. I use Tinder with very Little success, and some weeks ago i matched with a nice 18 year girl. She is very Smart and fun, i started talking to her and she always answered me with long paragraphs full of intelligent jokes, so it was a nice and funny chat. I really like her, i have never met a girl like her.

A couple days ago i decided to ask her for a irl meeting and we saw each other at a park. We spent the evening taking a walk together, talking about different things, laughing a lot, and we even kissed. After that, i decided not be too clingy and let her talk to me, or ask me for another irl meeting.

So yesterday she talked to me, we had a WhatsApp conversation all day, very funny as the irl one. She even dropped a ''tomorrow i have nothing to do at the evening, and you?''. I just told her that i have nothing to do too, but didn't ask her to go out due to not wanting to be very clingy.

Now i don't know what to do. Is 14 pm and she hasnt talked to me yet, and can't stop thinking that she won't ever talk me again. I don't want to talk to her to not seem desperate or clingy, but i really like her. I need some advice, i decided to let days pass to see if she talks me but i fear she won't..."
dating_advice,(M21)Is the girl with a boyfriend into me or just leading me on?,"I (M21) recently met a girl (19) at my place of work who I decided after a few day I would try to ask for her number. She said she had a boyfriend but she would give me her number anyways because I seemed like a cool guy. Well we start talking and she is just about as socially awkward as me, but have a lot of things in common and she seems very open so conversations are either buttery smooth or choppy and very stop and start. 
Well a few days of talking and we decide to hang out and after a few rescheduled times (both relatively busy people) we do hang out and she reveals to me that she did let me have her number since she was unsure of her relationship and was also interested in me/thought I was cute. Anyways since we have talked about everything under the sun as well as her boyfriend problems and I just dont think she understands it's kinda awkward for the guy that hit on you to give you relationship advice. I'm not a shitty guy that would enable cheating nor does she seem like a girl who would cheat, but little comments like ""I think you attract more girls than you think"" or ""wondering to me how it would be to date someone closer to her age"" (she is dating someone that's 12 years older than her). She apparently has told her mother about me and things like this. I guess I cant tell what I should be doing if anything at all, or if I'm barking up the wrong tree.

dating_advice,Trying not to come off as needy/obsessive,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôve (19F) been talking to this guy (22M) for almost three months now. Every day, we‚Äôd call each other at least once a day and text a few times. We saw each other twice and after the most recent date, things aren‚Äôt feeling too...right. I think the date went pretty good. We hung out for a few hours and after the date, he dropped me off, hugged me and kissed my neck and told me although he‚Äôd be busy this week, he‚Äôd still like to see me again. The day after, we talked on the phone a few times and texted. The next day, we called. The day after...no call. Next day after that, no call...Which is weird, since our routine is calling each other once a day, even when he is typically super busy, he‚Äôll call just to check on me really quick. All of a sudden, it just kind of...stopped. I feel as if I should ask if he really wants to see me again, as I deserve communication, but I don‚Äôt want to come off as needy or obsessive. Our date was Friday and it‚Äôs now Wednesday and things have just been a bit weird. It‚Äôs not like him, but I don‚Äôt want to be rude as he could truly just be busy. I really like him and I just need some advice on how soon to text him and ask if he‚Äôs still interested. I‚Äôm also a bit upset since it‚Äôs been 3 months of constant calls/texting and yet, it feels like he‚Äôs beginning to ghost me. ):"
dating_advice,Do I really need to be a douche to be attractive?,"23M here. I still have yet to find a girlfriend. When I say I‚Äôm a kind person, I mean other people tell me I am, and they tell me I need a girlfriend (much my mental anguish).The issue isn‚Äôt getting dates anymore, the issue is that they don‚Äôt want to continue after date 1. One day a friend of mine told me the only way to get attract women, is to be a douche. In other words you give them tons of positive attention, and then you ignore them afterwards, and then come back, and repeat. The main issue is that I don‚Äôt really want to treat women this way. But, do I really have to treat women like shit to get them interested in a relationship with me? Please tell me this is horrible advice."

dating_advice,had blackout sex with guy i‚Äôve been talking to and didn‚Äôt get a response when i tried to talk to him about it,"had blackout sex with guy i was seeing and when i tried to talk to him about it he didn‚Äôt reply

so i started talking to this guy right before i left the country for three weeks. and while i was away we talked almost everyday and i was really excited to see him again once i got back. well the day after i got back the city i live in was throwing a huge parade that all my friends were going to and we were all planning to get drunk af (saturday). well i guess i got too drunk bc i texted the guy to pick me up and he did. we hung out for a little then he dropped me off back home. 

i thought i was fine until the next day when i thought back on it i realized i couldn‚Äôt remember much of what we did and didn‚Äôt remember if we had sex or not. i just knew that i was being an annoying drunk girl so i texted him saying ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôm not usually like that at all‚Äù and he was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine dw about it!‚Äù and we had plans to hangout but he canceled because he had so much work to do so my plan to ask him what happened was ruined (sunday).

on monday, i decided to just ask him what happened. and this is where things got weird. i asked him what we did and he avoided telling me we had sex until i pressed it then he was super apologetic and guilty sounding which kind of freaked me out. he was like ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry i even made the move‚Äù ‚Äúi should have just drove you home‚Äù and ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù to which i responded ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, thanks for being honest. i‚Äôm sorry to have put you through this‚Äù. 

yesterday around 7pm(tuesday) i showed my roomie the texts and he told me that from a guys perspective it looked like i felt he took advantage of me and that a charge was coming or some shit. so i texted him again making it clear that i didn‚Äôt feel that way and haven‚Äôt gotten a response since then (it‚Äôs been one night). i feel like i shouldn‚Äôt have sent that text and that it made things so much worse but also i feel like it was still an okay thing to say.... 

idk i feel like i fucked this things up and am gonna be really sad if he doesn‚Äôt talk to me again:( 

summary: had blackout sex with a guy i was talking to for a month. he seemed to like me and i liked him but when i tried to talk to him about it  he got all weird and didn‚Äôt respond to my text assuring him that i was okay. did i fuck things up?"
dating_advice,How do you think ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù should work?,"Yesterday I [20F] ended such a relationship with a guy [20] (actually the entire ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù) because I felt he was just using me, but to him he absolutely wasn‚Äôt. I understand these things can be pretty subjective but as I want to know if I‚Äôm being irrational I‚Äôll try to explain to you guys my thoughts on the matter.

To me the whole point of having a *friend* with benefits is that this is a person you already know and care about, but for whatever reason a relationship is not on the table. (I‚Äôm talking exclusively about the arrangements where there was a previous friendship not the friends you make to have sex).

I genuinely don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm too naive for thinking that sex should be a caring act, I think you just have more fun when the other person is feeling good. Even with hookups my etiquette is trying to make everyone involved as comfortable and satisfied as possible, but I do get that in the end you are there to just do the act.

I think the difference between a ‚Äúno strings attached random hookup‚Äù and a FWB lies on the fact that there‚Äôs a level of care, trust and appreciation in the latter that isn‚Äôt there in the former. You feel safe because the other person is invested on your wellbeing in a way an acquaintance isn‚Äôt. 

The guy in question was always criticising everything, never made me feel desired or wanted, I didn‚Äôt feel like I cared about me. I always had to be the one to initiate sex (even when I had invited him explicitly for that). Talking to him was torture, having a conversation was hard because he found faults in everything I said, but not even in a fun teasing way but in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you‚Äù kind of way. Sex is funny, from the positions to the sounds, I laugh a lot when I‚Äôm enjoying myself but he was always so serious. I always felt like when I talked to him about other things that weren‚Äôt *this* I was annoying him. He did the deed, changed and went on his way. 

I think you kind of owe your friend acknowledgment, like a text saying ‚Äúhey, had a good time‚Äù or ‚Äúhow did your day go?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you free on Friday?‚Äù That sort of thing.

It‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a very caring person before we started having sex. At first I had even refused on the basis that I preferred to be his friend rather than become distant. He knew this and still pursued me and treated me like the person you f*ck and not care what happens to them afterwards, until you feel horny again. 
It felt like he was with me despite me instead of because of me. So I felt used. 

He would say I‚Äôm overthinking it. But I can‚Äôt help it, I think my feelings here are in the very least a little valid. What do you guys think?"
dating_advice,Getting over feelings while remaining friends,"Throwaway because she is a redditor. I feel like i might be writing this poorly so i'll TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So I (25,M) met this girl (23,F) through an online group back in September and we met up at an event and just had some drinks and chit-chat. We then hung out a few more times over the months just getting lunch/dinner or at her place and I started to really crush on her. I'm really bad at confessing my feelings though, so I never said anything to her, and we were just hanging out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Jan 1st, and she starts telling me about how she was hanging out with a guy on new years and they had some kind of fight. She tells me that she had been seeing him for a few months and etc etc etc i ended up helping her through her issues with the other guy, and she is now in limbo with him. At this point i just understand that she never saw me that way and that we were actually just being friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I've resigned myself to just being friends with her now, but I've still got feelings for her. How am I supposed to ""get over"" her, while still being her friend. I do still want to be her friend, but its hard when i'm still crushing on her.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, I missed my chance/never had a chance with a girl I'm crushing on. How do I get over my feelings while continuing to be her friend."
dating_advice,The Paradox of Attraction.,"Something I've personally noticed is that we often attribute unattractive people as *''socially-awkward''*. This can be true. But something I think is actually extremely overlooked is how socially awkward attractive people often are.   


I say this as an attractive man. Some may choose to see this as a humblebrag, and good for you, you're simple-minded. But I personally don't approach women. Don't ask me why I've just always been like this. I've never to date asked a single woman out. I just feel really uncomfortable doing so. So my interactions with women are never with romantic motives, but for everything else but. And through this, I have fallen into many relationships incidentally (which is probably the best way)...  


But what I have noticed is that because I don't approach women... Attractive women have generally two types of expression when they find me cute. There is the kind that will say hello to me 7 times a day and just act very clearly awkward (but very sweet). And then there is the kind that when I am required to interact with them... They're unnecessarily stoic and wooden and rigid (which often can be mistaken for disinterest or dislike). Ironically, though, this is how a lot of women act when they like you but don't know you well enough to feel comfortable being casual around you. And it wouldn't be until I got to know them as time went on that this became apparent. They didn't actually dislike me (they were just guarded and afraid of embarrassing themselves).   


And it made me realise: Attractive women are often very, very socially-awkward. They're used to men approaching them romantically that they're not typically interested in... But when it comes to the point where they now like a guy... They don't know what to do because they're not as accustomed to approaching as they are being approached. So they hope/assume that this guy they find cute will approach them (just like many prior guys have). If he doesn't then often nothing happens. But when he interacts with them in a professional way (instead of a romantic way) then they don't really know how to approach him because they're so used to being approached.   


I've personally noticed this where the moment women become ''comfortable'' around me and feel as if they know me then they immediately start flirting. But when they don't know me that well (it can be pretty obvious they find me attractive) but just act super serious because they're clearly not used to interacting with men they're interested in.   


So moral of the story here is, people. Attractive people are often just as socially-awkward as what you imagine unattractive people to be."

dating_advice,How do I [22M] stop the gut-wrenching nervousness and doubt in the moment of asking a girl out?,"Long story short, there's a girl [24F] in my office that I decided to talk to because I thought she was cute, and now I've decided to ask her out for coffee. I've been incredibly anxious and had needles in my stomach the past week, which was my brain telling me to talk to her more 1-on-1. so i did. the feeling came back because I'm now wanting to ask her out for coffee. and my brain is telling me to not blow it by 'waiting it out' so ive been filled with anxiety

**My brain tells me that is a logical decision:**

- Friend let me know that he thought I was a little more attractive than her. So my thoughts of ""she's out of my league"" are reasonable
- I let her know I'd check out her music she makes after talking to her more 1v1 - which was a way to talk to her more the last few days
- She's single, and I believe she's actively looking for a SO.
- When I talked to her she is friendly and smiling so its not like she will say ""fuck off idiot"" if she turns it down
- We work in office together, but don't work together. Before I talked to her, we never had conversation since we rarely see each other - so if she says no, then its not like we see each other 
- I'm asking her out for coffee. worst case she says ""no sorry"" and I say ""no problem [something to end the conversation, referring to an earlier topic and wrap it up like no big deal] 
- This is the most confident your brain has ever been in your odds to go on a date with a girl - she may say no - but you finally have a chance.

**But god knows my gut will be the opposite. Even just walking up to talk to her my heart bout beat out of my chest. I know my gut in the moment will say:**

- what if she tells her coworker and then it spreads around the office and people know? they'll all think youre small
- what if the few people that haven't left for the day hear you as you ask? and then it would be worse if she says no
- if she says no, you're gonna feel terrible and it'll be a self profiling prophecy once again that no one will ever say 'yes'
- The conversation you've had with her? yeah she doesn't care. she literally doesn't care that you asked about her music and would prefer you didn't talk to her at all.

---

TLDR: I've thought ""if there were some thing like weed that could calm me down. I would have absolutely 0 trouble asking her for coffee.... but not weed since I don't smoke.... and not drugs.... but something that does that stuff. I would nail it. She may even still say no. But I would at least walk away knowing i didn't blow it because of myself.""

So.... how do I do that. How do I calm the nerves IN THE MOMENT. Sure, ""count to 3 and do it"" works for taking action. But it sure as hell doesn't stop my heart from beating out my chest"

dating_advice,Tears Is The Definition Of What The Heart ‚ù§Ô∏èFeels About The Situation...,[removed]
dating_advice,"I (18M) thinks this girl (18F) likes me, but I'm at university and she isn't great at texting.","Ok so let me just tell a quick story. A month ago, I went to a friends party and met this girl. We're not going to go into too much detail, but I fell in love with her pretty quickly. I'm a very romantic kind of guy, you know how it is. She is incredible. But I play it quite well when I'm with her, don't worry. I saw her a few more times over the next week or so, and we got closer. We're very flirty and honestly if I wasn't so paranoid about this stuff I would have said she definitely liked me. I mean, we're brilliant together, it's quite obvious. Just very natural chemistry. She is on a gap-year, I am at university, a 4 hour, ¬£50 (return) train journey away from her. So I went back to university, upset because I thought I'd met someone very special (I'm underplaying how amazing we are together and how much I like her, I never thought I'd meet someone like this etc...) and I was about to put a lot of distance between us. 

So, we text a decent amount for 2 weeks, and get closer, while still retaining that fun, flirty banter. She isn't incredible at texting. And basically throughout the Christmas holiday I was going through a thing where I'd see her in person and think 'yep, we clearly like each other, this is amazing' then text for a few days and I would be left unsure and confused about where our relationship stood. And then I'd see her again and wonder why I doubted myself and the relationship. It must be noted that neither of us have much experience with this kind of thing. So I came back home last weekend, and we went to a party with some mutual friends... the first time we had seen each other in 2 weeks, where we'd been texting lots. And it was great, ok. We danced, she was looking at me and then quickly looking away when I looked at her, we flirted, had a laugh, there was lots of physical contact from both of us, it was great. She got in bed with me at one point (isn't as deep as it sounds, we were just playing around, nothing happened). So now I'm thinking she definitely likes me, not as much as I like her (although that's kind of impossible tbh), but nevertheless, I think we've found something special.

The next day, I'm feeling emotional. I have to go back to university tomorrow. Due to some familial problems, I kinda had to get out of the house, so I texted her out of the blue, asking if she wanted to do something. It was genuinely quite a friendly, casual thing, I didn't mean it as a date tbf. She opened it, took 45 mins to reply, and then very kindly said she couldn't because she was busy doing 'something'. She did tell me what that 'something' was, but I'm not going to share it here. But it was something she was already doing before I texted her, and not something she could have dropped. And it was already like 3PM when I asked her. She said sorry, and said she 'would have' if she wasn't doing that thing. And she wouldn't lie about this stuff, I've been texting her for a while now and she's VERY blunt and honest when texting. It's actually quite annoying sometimes lmao.

And now I'm back at university. I think I've found something really special here, but I don't know what to do. She is not very good at texting, and recently we were talking and she didn't reply to one of my messages. It wasn't deep, like she didn't have to reply it was kinda a dead conversation, but it still annoyed me because, well I enjoy talking to her. I finish my first year at university in 2 months. I change from being very confident she likes me, to being not sure about the whole situation. I want to ask her out again, but I don't want to seem clingy. What do I do? I just want to see her because... well, she makes me happy.

TLDR: honestly I can't make this any shorter, everything I said was very relevant to the story... sorry."

I'm meeting up with K more often. We meet up for coffee and talk about life. 


It's very obvious that he has feelings for me. They other day we went for coffee as usual, I talked about money issues and K immediately jumped to offer financial help (I said no) and told me he was always here for me. When we were walking round town it started raining and he offered me his coat. We accidentally bumped into each other once and his arm lingered on my back for longer than it probably should have but it felt nice. He gives the best hugs; the other week he gave me a long 5 minute hug as we were leaving and told me how much he cared about me.


I can't get him out of my head. I can't get rid the fantasies of what it would be like to kiss him.


He is one of my exes best friends; they've been friends for like 10 years now so it would maybe create friction between them if I made a move on K.


I am also kind of seeing someone else who I know really likes me, but I know she likes me a lot more than I like her. I've been seeing her for 2 months and we haven't made anything official; I'm not planning on it until if/when I properly develop feelings and she knows this and understands.


She doesn't know I have feelings for K. I didn't realise how strong the feelings were until the other day.

Should I make a move on K? Would it be a bad idea? Help"

A few weeks ago one of my friends tells me (26M) that his cousin (21F) is super into me. We've actually been friends on Instagram for a few years but have only met once.

We had a falling out over something silly and she deleted me off all social media. I tried reaching out to gibe an honest apologize but she hasn't responded and denied my follow on instagram. Fair enough, no hard feelings, even though I'm pretty beat up over thr whole thing. The weird part - my snapchat is public and she STILL is one of the first people to view my snapchat stories even though she has deleted me. What does this mean?

dating_advice,"I [23M] feel like this girl [19F] in my class is into me, but the fact that she's out of my league is preventing me from asking her out","First off, I should mention that I have almost zero experience with women and dating. Until recently, I've been overweight my whole life and women have never showed any interest and I never had the confidence to approach them. I should also mention I'm on the spectrum, but you wouldn't know it unless you got to know me very well.

I recently went from over 300 pounds to my current 185, and I think I'm experiencing a girl showing interest in me for the first time. The problem is, she's absolutely gorgeous. She looks like a blonde Demi Lovato and she has a really sweet, good girl personality.

I was interested in her immediately but of course I didn't act on it. But over the course of the few weeks that class has been in session, she's done the following things that make me think she might me into:

- sits next to me everyday
- groups up with me whenever possible, and when grouped up she moves her chair as close to mine as possible to where her thigh is grazing mine
- she gave me her phone number under the guise that I might need it for a group project
- she always talks to me, asks questions about me, and laughs at my attempts at jokes
- when leaving class, she'll often, but not always, wait for me outside the door so we can walk and talk together
- a couple times while walking, she complimented my shirt and and my hat
- the biggest one to me, one time while walking I mentioned how I wrecked my car and I'm currently without a vehicle and so my older sister has to drive me to campus, and she offered to pick me up and take me to campus even though 1. she lives on campus and 2. I live 45 minutes to an hour away from campus depending on traffic. I politely declined because I didn't want to burden her, as that's nearly 2 hours there and back. She was adamant that it wasn't a big deal at all and she'd love to do it, but I still declined

On the other hand, I checked her out on Facebook and her profile says she in a relationship with some guy she went to HS with and I overheard her mention something about her BF to a classmate, but I don't think she knew I heard her.

So basically I'm looking for advice on what I should do. Ask her out? Don't ask her out? If I do, what should I say? Thanks in advance for any help!"
dating_advice,M24 rejected by F24 despite good connection. Confused and looking for some advice.,"So I met a girl that works in the same hospital as me. Different floors but we had some overlap with patients occasionally. We had worked together more recently so I added her on FB and messaged her to set up a coffee date. This went well and she seemed interested during the date and over text so we went on to have 3 more dates. 

The second date was dinner and ice skating. We really clicked well and things seemed to be heading in the right direction. Lots of common interests and outlooks on life, though she is more religious than I am. Held hands while skating but didn't kiss. Third date was wine and movie night at my place. Conversation was steady and we cuddled a bit on the couch during the movie. The last date we cooked dinner together but shortly before the date she told me that she would have to leave fairly early because her friends made a change of plans for a friend's birthday outing to the same night. So we made dinner and talked for a bit but ultimately the date felt pretty rushed and I was probably a bit out of my element as a result, definitely the worst of our dates. My biggest regret across each date is that I never tried to kiss her, mostly due to my own anxieties and inexperience about making the move.

So I drop her off afterwards and text later that night to try to plan another date. She responded the next morning saying that she thinks I'm ""fun and truly a great guy"" but that ""right now her feelings aren't in it"" and that she wanted to respect my time and be honest. Altogether a pretty friendly let down but I felt pretty blind sided because I felt like we had developed a really good connection so far. 

I responded saying that I appreciated her honesty but felt that we had really good chemistry and would like to pursue further if she'd be willing to reconsider. I mentioned I didn't want to end things prematurely without giving things a proper shot and that it takes time for me open up romantically (i.e. not kissing after 4 dates). She responded that she likes taking dating slow so that wasn't the issue but she was sure of her feelings. Otherwise said that she was flattered by how I treated her during our dates saying I was very sweet and thoughtful. I accepted her rejection at that point and was friendly.

I guess my difficulty is that I feel like we had established a great baseline connection that had a lot of potential to build off of. I usually have no issue accepting a rejection, it happens, but for some reason this one has been much more challenging. I feel like we barely scratched the surface and that there would be a lot of good left to discover if we went on a few more dates. I wish I could convey that to her without having to pursue aggressively and disrespect her wishes. 

I'm sure I should move on but it's hard to let go of something that felt like it was going so well and had so much potential. Should I try to keep pursuing? Or maybe check back in with her in a month or so and see if we reconnect? Or something else?"
dating_advice,"For those of you who have done it, how did you go about dating a roommate/friend?","Ok, so I (27m) have had a crush on a friend/roommate (26f) who Iv known for two years now since we moved into our current house. We didn‚Äôt know each other before. She has been in a long distance relationship for the time so I never did or said anything about my feelings, mostly out of fairness and respect (even though most could tell the ldr was going nowhere), and the fact that telling her about my feelings could make my living situation very awkward.. but she has recently broken up with him after an extended time of them not really talking. 

The thing is, I know she likes me too., at least a little bit. My other roommates have told me she does, and we have always been kind of flirty, even more so now that she has broken up. We also have a lot in common and are each other‚Äôs ‚Äútype‚Äù

I really like her and think we would be good together, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do about the whole living together thing. If we weren‚Äôt roommates I‚Äôd just ask her out. I‚Äôm just nervous about how it could develop while living together. 

My room contract is up in the summer and I was planning on moving then anyway. I‚Äôm wondering if I should wait until then to tell her about my feelings and go from there, or should I just rip off the plaster and tell her before she potentially moves on to someone else. She has been broken up for over a month now and seems to be over her old relationship (I think she knew what was coming for a while)

Another nagging feeling has always been that if she really liked me she would have broken up with her pervious bf ages ago and made it a bit more obvious she was into me. Is that unfair of me to think? Or does it show she is like me and doesn‚Äôt want to do anything because we live together.

I know it‚Äôs a complicated one, but would appreciate some advise on the situation. I seem to be overthinking every scenario, now I don‚Äôt know what to do!"

dating_advice,Should I tell him that I like him?,I'm a 17 year old female and I have a crush on a friend. He is a really shy guy and doesn't really try to engage in conversations with people. He tries to talk to me but it is always about maths first then we may start talking about other things but mostly about maths. I try to talk to him about movies and music but he almost doesn't have any other interests. Also he is really close to me one day and another day he wouldn't look at my face. I really can't understand him. My feelings are getting stronger and it doesn't help the situation. I thought I might as well just confess and stop overthinking but my brother said I should let him know by my acts rather than straight up telling him. I tried but I can't really figure out how to. What should I do?

dating_advice,How do I ask out someone working without passing for a creep?,"Some context :
There is a girl I'd like to ask out, however the only time I see her, she is busy working and often with customers. Why? Because yes she works at a bar. But no, she is not paid on tips (it doesn't work that way where I live).

I'd like to ask her to grab a cup of coffee with me one day but I don't really know how to do so. I'm afraid to be some kind of creep if just ask her out of the blue but I don't want to disturb her with chit chat while she is busy working.

So here's the million dollar question (spoiler : it is already in the title) : how can I ask her if she's willing to spend some time with me out of work? 

I might not have a chance with her since she needs to be friendly with anyone because of her job (so no clues at all if she likes me). But I'm struggling with the same anxiety any time I'd like to approach someone so I'm thinking this might be a good way to start building my confidence even if it falls apart. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for all your great tips."
dating_advice,Why do people mention practicality when mentioned long distance relationship but all of a sudden turn into hopeless romantics when people choose to be single due to practical reasons?,"I see that happening a lot. Not just with me but many others too. That makes no sense.

 If being practical is the goal, be practical in all aspects.

If one wants to be a hopeless romantic, that okay too. 

Nothing wrong with either as long as other people's choices aren't affecting you. 

But ideology changing so dramatically from one to another, i am finding it difficult to wrap my head around it. 

Can anyone explain?

dating_advice,How do I stop feeling worthless?,"Hi,

I am having trouble with my self esteem and confidence. Last year I decided to improve my dating life. I'm currently 24M who has never been in a relationship before. I'm having trouble binding with people. My family is cold and distant, they never ask me how I'm doing, and I can't express any emotion to them because I will get teased because of it. This has fucked both me and my younger sister up, we grew apart and haven't spoken in almost 10 years.

I've met a girl last year, went out with her on a date, but she later told me she's not interested in me. We stayed friends for some time, but I always wanted more. Eventually, I realized that this kind of ""friendship"" isn't real, so I tried to date her again. Terrible mistake. We got in a fight and never spoke again. We were friends for 6 months and I feel like shit because of it because I basically told her that I don't want to be her friend anymore.

I am currently having trouble opening up to anyone, feeling broken inside and just want to cry. Could you please give me some advice on what to do?"
dating_advice,making it official / ‚ÄúwHaT aRe wE‚Äù,"little backstory: i‚Äôve known this guy for over two years and we used to be really close friends. recently we both went thru our own breakups and rekindled a friendship with each other. a little after this, we both admitted we have feelings for each other, kissed, been on dates‚Äî all that. fast forward a month, we‚Äôve spent the night together twice because he drove down to my college to visit :,) i like him ~so~ much and he told me he feels the same...

anyways, we act like we‚Äôre dating and he speaks to me (and about me) like i‚Äôm his girlfriend. i‚Äôve asked multiple friends about this and can‚Äôt seem to get tangible advice. 

SO the question is: should i ask him where this is going? although i know it‚Äôs headed towards a relationship, it‚Äôs hard to tell with a timeline since we basically already know each other really well, i don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúget to know him.‚Äù should i bring it up and ask? or just wait?"
dating_advice,Should I (F20) ask my crush (M22) to be together with me,"So I‚Äôve asked him out on a date a couple weeks ago, he mistook it as me asking him out as a friend (despite using the word date). I told him I have feelings for him, not once but twice, to confirm that no misunderstandings happen. 

The date by the way went amazing, we both felt comfortable and could openly talk about things we couldn‚Äôt really talk to other people. 

Things isn‚Äôt awkward between us either, we talk a lot, share and discuss memes and play games together. 

Just to describe him a bit, he‚Äôs a shy guy, but very sweet, open minded and funny. I can be my straightforward and bubbly self around him. He has a hard time reading social situation but I don‚Äôt mind it since I‚Äôm the same and try to make up for it by communicating. 

Would I be moving too fast if I asked him to be together with me? I like him, and I would rather be rejected than not knowing if he‚Äôs into me or not.

TL:DR asked crush out on date, crush thought I asked him out as friend, I tell him how I feel for him. We keep talking and gaming like normal. Should I ask him to be together with me?"

dating_advice,How to date after overcoming depression?,"I (21, male) was really depressed and with a few suicidal thoughts for about 3-4 years, I've never had a real girlfriend and I've always been shy, around women. I ""dated"" ( not really ) one girl during those dark years, but come to think of it, I never really liked her that much I was just alone and really, really sad that I forced myself to like her. 

Somehow I feel a lot better now, like extremely my confidence is back, gained weight, I was really skinny and 80% of my acne is gone.

But i'm really lost, it's hard to make new friends and connect with new people, specially girls and I'm afraid i'm just gonna end up alone, which by reading a lot of reddit posts it's a very common thing. 

I like to be alone, and for the most part I want to, but having someone to share your time and thougts with sounds like something really cool, yet the risk of getting hurt, in my head, It's hunting me, because I know depression never really goes away, and I know that bad relationships and toxic people can cause tremendous pain.

My parents didn't have a good marriage, I learned that my dad was cheating on my mom at a very young age in a very disturbing way. He was my hero growing up and now I am very afraid of ever becoming like him."

Last week, we went on a huge conference event that lasted 2 days. We both already knew each other before the conference event. I knew she would come because I messaged her last time that I will go and she told me she would also go to that conference. We told each other that see you on the conference event.

We bumped each other during the course of breaks in that conference, said hi to each other. But we did not really talk much in person because she was with her friends and I was also busy by that time and I'm with my friends. After the conference event last Saturday, I messaged her on how was the conference. We chatted a bit and had a good conversation but she really took a long time to reply to my last chat messages.

Well one time her best friend offered me a ride home last time. Only 2 of us in the car. Then she kept pushing me on telling her on who is my crush. She also told me that if I tell her who is my crush, she will help me to set up on that person she knows

Well, I only know one common friend of her best friend and its her who is my current crush. Sooo yeah that is what I thought. My crush also invited me to an event before I message her.

Sooo yeah, right now idk if my crush likes me because I only know one common friend that I interact with and which is her

Like after I mentioned my crush name in a car in a casual conversation, she pauses a bit then she answered. And like afterwards she kept pushing me who is my crush

So yep, she did not reply back to my last chat message. Its been more than 48 hours and idk what happened. Idk if I am just overthinking this but I don't want to think ill thoughts about her ghosting me or something. Any opinions?"

dating_advice,My new interest has been lying to me about her Number!! Need advice," 

Hey Reddit

A little back story, i met this girl last year november month and we were just friends for about a month, shes still young and i happen to be almost 7 years older than here, anyways we hit it off pretty well as friends and decided to stay that way at first. What happend was we spent sometime together and then our chemistry lead us to the next thing, we ended up kissing and then things changed between us. She spent the holidays with me and my family, for a period of time before she went back to hers for the remainder of the holidays, we have slept together as well. Ive been introduced to the family and she mine as well and we all get along pretty well.

Okay so here is the problem, or well not a problem, but more of a concern, Im working a 7-5 job everyday and she is still studying. Since i am in a position in my life where im looking for a long term partner, which i have properly communicated, and setup my boundaries with her she knows how i feel and all that, i know i havent done some good things in my past but i have also communicated everything to her from what it was how many poeple ive slept with and all. Ive told her about everything and have been completely transparent with her about everything in my life. Shes told me she has had 1 boyfriend which i believe and it was a longterm one and shes been single for a year or so which i also know about, but we have spoken about certain things including her number which she has told me was 2, i have found something a list so to say, which had the names of 15 or more people on it which shes slept with.

Okay look i know everyone has a past and im comfortable knowing it, thats not my problem here, my problem is that shes not being honest with me and that makes me feel like i cant trust her, she really fits in well and shes already part of the family and treats me pretty well since weve only been seeing eachother for a while now. Its still a brand new relationship, my only other problem is that im not sure how to think about it im fine and then i feel like i dont want to build a relationship based on deciet rather honesty and transparency, she has to accept me for who I am and i have to accept her for who she is and im prepared to do that, i just have no idea how to properly confront this situation and need some perspective! TIA"

dating_advice,Been ghosted by someone who I really thought cared; should I try and get through to them?,"I matched with someone on a dating app, got along really well and made plans for 4 different dates! I quickly learned that she was very sweet and very caring. Every time she was out with friends or fell asleep she would be very apologetic and it just never seemed like she would ghost. 

Anyway, we wait 3 weeks for her to come back to uni (where I live) to go on our first date just the day after she gets back! We talk every day in those 3 weeks. 

The date was nice, she seemed very sweet as I thought she would be, hugged goodbye and she mentioned about our list of dates and how we can start going through them now she‚Äôs back in the area. 

Then I message her that I‚Äôm home. 4 hours later she says she‚Äôs going out with mates. Fair enough, I tell her enjoy the evening and leave it at that. Next day I message her and nothing. It‚Äôs now been 3 days and the message is unopened (on snapchat) even though she‚Äôs posted stories of her having food with a uni friend etc. 

My issue is, I don‚Äôt want to overreact or be weird. I‚Äôve already tried to follow up asking if she‚Äôs alright but no response yet. I just feel like I‚Äôve been led on and then just pushed aside and forgotten. It‚Äôs happened before but she‚Äôs really not the type who I thought would do it!

dating_advice,How to not feel guilty when online dating?,"TLDR: is it weird to feel guilty for talking to four guys at one time? Should I continue talking to all of them, or do I end things with all but one?


So I‚Äôm gonna try and keep this short. I‚Äôve (19F) only been in one official relationship. We met at a party and I had just broken things off with a guy I was talking to. My ex and I began dating officially right after that, since neither of us were seeing anyone else. 

Now, it‚Äôs been a year since the breakup. I was seeing one guy up until three weeks ago and I genuinely liked him more than anyone I had ever met. We matched on bumble, but I had actually met him briefly in person the day my ex and I broke up. Anyways, we had to break things off due to him getting a job offer very far away. We were never official, but I cut all contact with every guy I was talking to the day I matched with him. I just knew that he was special.


This brings us to today. I got on tinder and have begun talking to some really nice guys. However, I can‚Äôt help but feel so guilty about saying yes to dates with multiple guys at once. Last week, I had three dates with three different guys (two from tinder) and I antagonized so much over it. I didn‚Äôt feel a spark with any of them, so I politely declined second dates with the three and moved on. 

Now, I have a date set up for Friday with another tinder boy who I‚Äôve been talking to for a week. He seems incredibly sweet and seems pretty interested in me. We‚Äôve been texting every day. But, there‚Äôs another guy that I‚Äôve been chatting with on tinder that I really like too. Then there‚Äôs a guy that I used to talk to that‚Äôs recently come back into my life. He is my ex‚Äôs friend (my ex and I ended amicably and he is cool with this). Finally, there‚Äôs a third boy that I honestly see more as a friend, but he is also very nice. All of these boys are the same major at my college, to make things even more awkward. 


Almost every time I go on a first date with a guy, it turns into me talking to them for a few months and going on dates exclusively. The only times I haven‚Äôt had a second date were last week. Another thing I should note is that most of the time when I talk to a guy, nothing physical happens. I‚Äôve only kissed four people, one being my ex and the other three being drunk one time things with guy friends who I never talked to romantically. 


Should I only talk to one tinder guy at a time? Or do I talk to all four and then decide? I feel like I‚Äôm juggling guys and I just worry that I‚Äôll hurt their feelings."

I live in a major city and I try to meet new people through coed rec league sports by so far I haven't had much luck.

dating_advice,Why did he drop me to go back to an unhealthy relationship?,"I was seeing this guy who‚Äôd just come out of a turbulent relationship. They dated for one year and within that time had already gone on multiple breaks and broken up once before. This time he ended it and told her he didn‚Äôt want to continue. Yes, poor judgement on my part getting involved, I admit...I should have stayed well away.

We were seeing each other for two months and we had amazing chemistry and a really great connection. We got along incredibly well and were like two kindred spirits (his words, not mine). But I could tell that he still had unresolved feelings about his ex. I could tell he wasn‚Äôt completely available emotionally. In hindsight, I think it was far too soon after his relationship ended to be in the right headspace for something new.

Things started to get better and we did start to get closer however. He was slowly becoming more attentive and more open with his feelings, and I felt like we were slowly getting somewhere. Then...cue the ex. After two months, she reached out to him and asked him if he‚Äôd been with anyone else. He ended up telling her about me and it apparently ‚Äútore her heart out‚Äù. And lo and behold, just like that he dropped me and went straight back to her. He left me to go back to his rocky, unstable relationship that already hadn‚Äôt worked in the past.

Why did he do this? I guess when a relationship ends, we forget about all the bad things that made us want to end it and we remember all the good things, which naturally leads to feelings of regret, guilt, and longing. It just hurts. That he would leave something stable and good to go back to something which had proven to be unhealthy and not worked in the past. Someone he‚Äôd made the decision to break up with twice before. I‚Äôd love to hear any stories from you guys, whether that‚Äôs from being on my side, where someone leaves you for their ex, or being on the other side, as the person who goes back to an unhealthy relationship. I‚Äôm just trying to understand it all and make a little more sense of it because I genuinely felt we had something special. I‚Äôm so sure it wasn‚Äôt just in my head."

dating_advice,Reconnecting???,"Please bear with me, it's kinda long but td;rl at the bottom...

My boyfriend (M20) and I (F19) have been dating over two years now and I'm really struggling. It isn't very much about him and being with him, but rather the things we have to deal with. We are both attending the same community college right now. While I'm a full-time student, he is a part-time student with a part-time job as well as being on our student senate. Last semester he wasn't too involved and so now wants to be more involved this new semester. While that is all fine, there are just a lot of troubles and stress-related things. A lot of these things are causing a lot of fear, stress and/or anxiety for him:

*- Last semester he started out with only two classes, one not even giving him actual credits towards graduation. \[Usually, someone should at least be taking 3 classes for 9 credits (part-time student)\]*

*- He was supposed to get financial aid to pay for classes or else they will get dropped and he wouldn't get any other credits. (falling really behind compared to others and I'm pretty sure he is struggling a lot because he feels like he is starting to fall behind compared to others, including myself and I know it is causing a lot of anxiety, stress and/or fear)*

*- He moves out of his current house to an apartment with a relative soon, so he has to deal with al the paperwork, forms, moving etc.*

*- He thinks he has ADHD but can't afford to get assessed. (He displays like almost all the symptoms and no, he can't ask his family.* 

*- Family can be sometimes critical and since he has a job, they assume he has enough money to take care of himself, including food,  paying to school and don't really believe in mental illnesses...*

However, despite all my encouraging words or me just trying to not push too hard onto him, he either tries to shut me out or want to change the subject. I know it's because when he thinks about it, the stress fear or whatever else comes to him and he just wants to escape it?!? Sometimes, whatever I do, nothing seems to get him to see that he should probably prioritize event B rather than event A.

Td;rl My boyfriend is struggling with a lot of life events and has a lot of moving parts right now. I'm trying to support him in every way I can, but it's no use as he usually avoids a certain topic such as school-related things and wants to handle it himself or gets mad at me when I push too much about it. How should I handle all of this? How can I support him, but find the right words to help him see I'm not trying o be annoying but helpful."

It changed me. I started focusing just on me and getting better. Working out, eating healthy. Reading books , watching YouTube videos on self esteem and narcissistic behaviour. 

Now I am going on my first date since all of this, so excited to get back into dating. I met a guy off of hinge we connected though text and doesn‚Äôt ask me for anything sexual. I am praying the dinner goes well but why won‚Äôt it ?! That‚Äôs there not to love!

dating_advice,"He finally told me he loved me after 2 years, but now is being distant?","I don‚Äôt know the appropriate label to give this guy, But I guess it makes most sense to call him my ex. We meet back in mid 2017 when he (24) was a teller at my bank and I would come in routinely mostly with the intention of just seeing him. For months we exchanged very few words but many long stares until I finally got tired of waiting and got the courage to slip my number onto a note to him. We began dating immediately and definitely had more rough patches within the first few months of dating than most should. We were on and off for a total of 2 years and through the whole thing he was never able to tell me he loved me. Things officially ended in October of 2019 when I found out he cheated on me at the very beginning of the relationship and on other occasions during the relationship. I swore I was done and we cut contact for about a little over a month before I caved and reached out again; which was only a few weeks ago. This past weekend, we went out to a local bar near his house to meet up with one of his friends and to make it a long story short it ended with us yelling at each other out back of the bar. Ever since I found out about the cheating I haven‚Äôt been able to keep myself from making incredibly passive and childish comments referring back to the cheating and the girls. After we fought for a bit he finally confessed to me that he loved me and wanted to tell me earlier. Since this past Sunday after that night, I feel he‚Äôs gotten distant and I‚Äôm not sure if he feels weird for the exchanging of those words to me. It was surreal because I never thought I would get to hear that from him and also because he‚Äôs gotten dealt a pretty shitty card in his part with the sudden death of his dad, and then him being cheated on himself with someone I knew he really loved. I‚Äôm also positive he‚Äôs never told anybody besides his mom he loves them. So I just don‚Äôt know what to think of it. Was because we were drunk? Was it to better the situation? I just can‚Äôt stop replaying that moment and I wish I wasn‚Äôt as drunk as I was so I could remember it better. Let me know what you guys think!!"

He has barely answered my texts in the last week and hasn‚Äôt texted me when before this last hangout he would ask me how my day was going or at least keep the conversation going. 

My question is is this just unfortunate timing and things might progress or is this a sign he is not interested and cut my losses and move on?"
dating_advice,Does anyone not ghost?,"Whenever I see someone talk about ghosting online they talk about it like it's something that *SOME* people do. As if it's a rude but not unusual thing that a lot of people do. But people generally talk about it as though it's wrong and you shouldn't do it.

But like... I've been online dating for a few years now, and I've been out with at least 50 or 60 so women. And in my experience virtually all of them ghost. I think I've had one or two actually politely tell me that they weren't interested in pursuing things any further. But apart from the ones that I personally wasn't interested in and let know that (or sometimes I'd just claim to be sick for a week and by then they'd have moved on) but anways.... everyone else ghosts. Like, I haven't been counting, but it's gotta be like 30 ghosts by now. Girls I went on one date with. Girls I talked to for a couple months. Or girls I'd had sex with. Or girls totally new to online dating...

Which for me gives off a bit of a disparity between how people talk about ghosting and the reality. Like I don't think the girls I see are particularly rude or immoral or anything. They just seem normal, and so I get the impression that ghosting is just the default way to break things off. People talk about it as if it's rude, or it's just something you do in really particular situations to creeps or stalkers or people who can't take a hint. But that's not been my experience at all.

My experience is that just about any girl (maybe guys too idk), the moment she decides she doesn't want to see you anymore, will completely stop responding to you what so ever.

By now it's probably becoming a bit clear that I'm venting (I'm realizing it too lol). But I guess I just don't get when or from where people became so cruel. I date a lot. I meet women I don't want to see again. But I've never ghosted any of them.

I also don't buy into the idea that ghosting is the kinder way to let someone down. In my experience the (two) times I've been told straight that a girl wasn't interested, I found it to actually be very respectful. And while I understand that a lot of women fear receiving  a rude angry textin that case, isn't that just as likely to happen if you ghost someone?

Honestly I think it's kinder to keep telling the person you're busy till they gets the message, because at least then they are able to move on in the meantime (Idk ya'll can tell me if that's also shitty.). But when someone just stops responding to messages flat out, you get the message in a day in just about the harshest form. Not only are they not into you, but they don't feel the need to dignify you with a response.

Idk, I'm just getting back into dating after a relationship and it just feels incredibly cruel. Like if a girl is into me and if I'm not into her then I feel bad but let her down as kindly and respectfully as possible. But if the roles are reversed I'm tossed aside without a shred of consideration.

(Also, no I doubt it's something I'm doing because as I've said before, a lot of girls and I hit it off just fine.. but then again who's to say maybe ya'll will tell me my experience is unique and so it probably is me).

Ok rant over I guess lol

Contrary to my venting sadness; Girls (and others), how do ya'll feel about ghosting? Is it a necessary evil or not an evil at all? What does it feel like when you're ghosting a guy?"

And then re-install all of them and go through the same process AGAIN. 

Honestly it‚Äôs like I forgot how to get an actual date in person due to OLD.

dating_advice,How can I deal with this problem of mine?,"Alright starting off, I'm (17M) the type of person who is usually friends with everybody, and I try to be nice and funny with them. I try to be the best person I can when interacting with other people. Recently I met this girl who is my age and we go to the same school, first day we met was awesome, we chatted for a bit and exchanged contact info. Now we are snap chatting conversations daily, we have already gone on 1 date which turned out very good and I think she also has some feelings for me.

Now, here is my problem. I like to base my decisions / opinions on logic, so going off of this I keep thinking that If I want anything to happen with this girl I would have to show her im interested right? Well I do not want to seem desperate and such, and I try to tell myself that I should not try to talk to her every day, that It might look bad on me. Whenever we text so far i've been the one to start conversations but I get responses rather quickly, usually, if she doesn't then probably busy. I don't know if I should keep being the one to start conversations, also some of my friends tell me that I should give her some time to herself so like back off the texting for a day or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really torn on how to act towards this, and I am starting to like her a lot. This is really messing with my judgement and decision making. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL ; DR I like this girl and don't want to look clingy / desperate but at the same time I don't want her to lose interest in me for not interacting with her."

dating_advice,Going no contact to stop being clingy.,"Going no contact with girl im talking to to avoid being clingy.

I am always giving more than she is giving. I havent see her for over a week. I think I am being too clingy. We have been talking for about 2 months. I had to take a hard look at myself and realize I was being clingy already. No matter how much giving im doing for her I wont ever be secure. Everything is always over analyzing her moods thinking she is tired of me. Also too our conversations have slowly dwindled. Therefore I had to do something.

I just started filling up my schedule more and I completely stopped talking to her until she reaches out. She is busy, and it s cares because im not getting any attention. I need to get busy too. Ive already signed up for piano lessons along with some volunteering work around Maryland.  

It hurts to do this, but its for the better. If she truly cares about me she will call me or text me. Im taking a stand, no longer being the initiator in order to make myself feel secure with someone. If she cares she will reach out. If not, oh well. Being clingy is only making it more envitable that she will completely pull away. 

Wish me luck. Maybe going silent will be good for me and my anxiety."

I just do not have the confidence in myself sometimes to just start a conversation with him. I know that some people are completely against work relationships but at this point of my life, going through extreme loneliness and depression, I am ready to find someone and finally be happy.. Every time I leave work, I just want to sleep because I get this painful feeling because I missed the opportunity to talk to him. I guess the advice I‚Äôm asking for is what is the best way to approach him in the antisocial environment I am in? Should I even bother, since he may definitely not have any interest? I don‚Äôt want to embarrass myself at work."

dating_advice,Why would it be important to have an affair be public?,"If you were having an affair with a married man that isn't going to leave his wife public at work? Both expect everyone to take them seriously as a couple but have met a generally negative response, complained that people were being rude. They call it off then two weeks later they're back together publicly again? How would this benefit either of them?

I feel extremely vain for thinking it but convinced she's trying to make me jealous/not feel stupid for rejecting me when I basically told her I loved her. Obviously more to the situation but just can't think of any other possible explanation for what's going on right now. I know I shouldn't even care and it's none of my business but I would prefer a different explanation from the one going through my head"
dating_advice,Weird situation,For a few months now I‚Äôve been snapping a girl and we talk a lot and some of her friends told me that she likes me but I don‚Äôt really know. Over these months she‚Äôs never said a word to me but she always just looks over at me and just looks at me sometimes.

But I've known him for a couple of years (while he had a gf), so he's seen me around just being me. I thought maybe he actually might want to get to know me. But I think I'm wrong :(

dating_advice,Was this too much?,"I matched with this guy on Tinder and we‚Äôd been on Snapchat for a couple weeks. If I didn‚Äôt agree with something he said it would sound to him like I was ‚Äúattacking his character‚Äù or ‚Äúprojecting‚Äù onto him. From my perspective this wasn‚Äôt the case. Then today he sends me this pic of a tweet about having ‚Äúraw sex‚Äù with no contraception and wrote ‚Äúmooooood üòèüòèüòè‚Äù on it, to which I flipped shit.  Given that I am a woman and would have to bear the cost should unprotected sex result in pregnancy, men saying they don‚Äôt want to use contraception for any reason is complete bs to me and I stand up for myself 100% of the time. When he sent me that I just freaked cause pregnancy or the fear of it is a way that women have been, and unfortunately remain, oppressed around the world and gender equality gets me really riled up. So after what seemed like moving past that and exchanging a couple other snaps he blocked me. 

So, my question is: what do you think happened? Would you agree that he was being insensitive in his response?

(Couldn‚Äôt post pics so I just copied and pasted convo)


Him: *initial pic of tweet*

Me: 
Not really
Easy for you to say when there‚Äôs not much risk in it for you
Men, on average, think they can be picky when it comes to contraception because the power of potentially being pregnant is something they will NEVER experience
So no
Not a mood
Unintended pregnancy negatively affects measurable health and economic outcomes in populations. That is a fact.
You may get to experience the ‚Äúraw sex‚Äù, but won‚Äôt have to suffer through plan B or be the one to call out sick from work cause you had to get an abortion
That is an ignorant and selfish thing to say

Him:
Brooooo u just took the most simple thing
And gave me a whole page essayüòÇ üî• 
* ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
Even if u didn‚Äôt agree with it...simply just say that...this went from me trying to share something with u
To now me feeling bad and extremely judged from u about myself for even wanting to share that to you nd that‚Äôs fucked up
Idk who u fucked before that did that to u but I‚Äôm not them
And projecting all this on me...most of which I already fkn know as a grown ass man is ignorant and selfish
I can‚Äôt even be cute with u..everything I send u, even if it‚Äôs a meme becomes this attack on my character and then u list all these facts like we‚Äôre havin a prevention program
ITS JUST SOMETHING KINKY ND FUN
U NEED TO FKN RELAX

Me:
If you already know cause you‚Äôre a grown ass man why do you think it‚Äôs acceptable to say?
And it‚Äôs not an attack on your character
There is a difference between telling someone that their behavior is uncool versus that they are personally
Prevention program? Yeah... standing up for thousands of years of people who have been oppressed via pregnancy

Him: *snap of him at the gym*

Me: *sent this at almost the exact same time as he sent snap of him at the gym*
Just because I have an opinion and am upset by something you said doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm projecting something onto you
It means I‚Äôm communicating
It‚Äôs never happened to me personally, but it has happened to millions of women who didn‚Äôt have the social or economic means to act independently and stand up for themselves

Him: *another gym snap*
Me: *youtube video of hamsters eating mini bento cause it cute and thought he might think so to*
Him: blocks me about 5 hrs later"
dating_advice,Not sure what to do or how go feel,"I(f28) recently got out of a long term relationship about a month ago and soon after reconnected with an old high school boyfriend (27m). We have been hanging out for the past two weekends and gotten together three times in that time. We are both flirty and have made out twice. He told me at first he wasn't interested in anything serious right now but he keeps saying he likes me and keeps doing thinks like putting his arm around me and making sure go text me every day. He is going to grad school in our state in a few months and even though it's just been a few weeks, I'm falling for him. I can't tell if he is falling for me or not. He has also mentioned wanting to move out of state after grad school to the other side of the country so he can rock climb and mentioned being able to climb with a female friend but didn't mention anything about me.
TLDR: falling for guy who said he wasn't interested in a serious relationship but now I'm not sure if he is and also curious about a female friend he has"
dating_advice,Girl seemed into me now seems like she's avoiding me. What do I do?,"I (18M) met this girl (22F) at a college event and I was pretty into her buy was waiting to see how things went when she asked me out first. We had a group dinner as that date and we talked a lot (long FaceTimes, almost daily calls, 1 on 1 movie nights, etc.) I asked her on a second date which we had planned but then she had something come up so we decided to rain check. I had to go back to my home state for the break and we called right before I left confirming that we had a date when I got back. While I was away she took really long times to reply (few days sometimes longer) she just did graduate from college and started her job full time so I understand she‚Äôs busy plus she restarted taking medicine for PTSD. Since I‚Äôve gotten back into town, not many texts at all but we see each other at this college event and she acts normal like we used to. Is this worth pursuing? Should I bring it up to her?"
dating_advice,why do i hate it when my girlfriend goes out,[removed]
dating_advice,I asked out a friend and now I need help,"To make a long story short, me and this girl have been hanging out almost the entire semester with a group of friends and I always wanted to ask her out. This would be my first time asking a girl out and I finally did it but it was during the last week of the semester which was when exams started. This happened after we ate dinner in a group of 3 and whilst we were walking back from the cafeteria to the dorms, one of our friends departed midway to talk to another friend, so it was just me and her and we ended up talking a bit and I decided to bite the bullet and ask her out. She said maybe and that she‚Äôll have to think about it. 

Skip 2 days later, we had dinner again in our group of friends, where afterwards she privately told me that it was a no and that she doesn‚Äôt like me like that. That was fine until the last day before I moved out of my dorm where I wanted to just say goodbye. She was mad at me, saying that what I did was not okay, that I should have asked another person from the group about whether or not that she might like me, and that by asking her out during finals, it caused her to go under a lot of stress.

I apologized the best way I can and said my goodbyes. I felt like shit the entire winter break falling into a deep depression of sorts but time skip to now where I just finished my first week of the second semester and I thought everything will go back to normal and we could make up. But she still seems to be mad at me, for instance I saw her deliberately avoiding me and things still seem very tense.

I have talked to a couple of my friends and my father because I wanted to get a better insight of the whole situation, and they all said that I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong and that I had no way of knowing that she would say maybe, claiming that she was just overreacting because she too has never dated anyone and she might have just didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

I don‚Äôt entirely agree with my friends and they might just be saying that to cheer me up so I wanted to ask for help for an honest opinion. Was I the asshole in this situation and fucked up because I asked out during finals. If so, how should I resolve all this? Please don‚Äôt answer ‚Äújust give it time‚Äù or ‚Äúforget her‚Äù. I also posted this on AITA but they took my post down due to rule breaking.

TLDR

I asked a girl out during finals week which caused her to go under a lot of pressure which made her mad, and after winter break she‚Äôs still mad. A lot of my friends are saying it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I don‚Äôt agree and I would like advice on how I should handle this whole situation."
dating_advice,26F hanging out with 24M. Is this casual or something more?,"I‚Äôve been hanging out with this guy, but I‚Äôm not really sure what this is. 

From what I know, he recently broke up with his ex because she moved to a different state. He‚Äôs told me on our first date that he was having fun on this date but had to be honest that he was still talking to her to figure things out. I don‚Äôt know if that is to end communication completely or to work out a LDR or be friends? He mentioned that they weren‚Äôt friends and he also didn‚Äôt want to be misleading if I was expecting anything. Maybe this is a dead giveaway and this post is useless? Who knows. 

We‚Äôve hung out a total of three times. There‚Äôs just all these small little interactions that make me question what this is. We‚Äôve kissed, but haven‚Äôt slept together. I figure I would‚Äôve been a rebound or if this was just casual sex or w/e but doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. We‚Äôre just touchy-feely when we hang. He‚Äôll gently kiss me when I hug him or caress him and vice versa. There‚Äôs a lot of mention of we and things we are gonna do next time. The touchy-feely stuff makes me think there‚Äôs more to this than just hanging out. 

Alsooo I‚Äôve done oral on him a couple of times, but he goes soft after a bit. I am a little bit rusty since it‚Äôs been a while (lol). I‚Äôve asked him if that was the case, and he just says it‚Äôs not me. That he‚Äôs just in his own head. This has happened twice. Our make out sessions get real hot and steamy lol. I assume maybe he‚Äôs not ready? Which is okay. No worries. We also don‚Äôt have to get completely naked or sleep next to each other in the nude. 

Cherry to top it all? He says he‚Äôll be out of town for a week. I don‚Äôt want to say where in case he reads this, but it‚Äôs the same place where his ex moved out too. This trip was probably made in advanced way before I met him or when they broke up. They probably didn‚Äôt even plan to break up, but I‚Äôm speculating. I haven‚Äôt asked him to clear this whole thing up because I said I didn‚Äôt care.  Now I‚Äôm doing too much thinking and a bit embarrassed to ask since I said otherwise. 

I don‚Äôt mind it being casual, but only if it was a bit more simple like if he was in a open LDR or looking for hookups but he‚Äôs giving me no leads just confusing ones. What is this?? I have so many theories and none of them makes any sense to me"

dating_advice,Are we (29F) dating on (43M) his terms only?,"Dating a new guy that I‚Äôm very into. 

He compliments me a lot, seems to be an engaged listener and is great in bed. 

Anyways we‚Äôve only recently started dating and just started to have sex. 

It was my birthday last week and he asked if I was doing anything. I said no and he offered to take me out. It was sweet and we had a great time. I didn‚Äôt want to have sex afterwards because: 

A. Didn‚Äôt want the date and expectation of sex correlation. 
B. I really like him
C. We‚Äôve already had sex and didn‚Äôt want it to be a huge thing. 

Well after dinner, he starting walking to my car (we were in his neighborhood) and assumed I was taking him home .. and probably sleeping with him. I had no intention on taking him home and was actually going to another event afterwards (but decided not to tell him) 

Looking back he may have taken me running my heel up his leg at dinner as a sign...or my holding his hand on the drive home as a sign. 

Either way, we got to his house. He asked me to come up. I told him just for a few. I was fine with making out but didn‚Äôt want to have sex. 

We make out. He pulls it out slightly and asked to lay down. 
I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. 
He asked if I was on my period. 
I said no, I just didn‚Äôt want sex to become the only thing we focus on. 
He exclaimed ‚Äúwe do things! That‚Äôs not what this is‚Äù. 
He started casually rubbing hisself on me. I like it but really was trying to have will power. 

I ended up getting up and walking away and he pulled his pants down and said ‚Äúlook how hard you make me‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really really wanted to bang him and was never uncomfortable. I just thought it wasn‚Äôt good for our budding relationship so early on. I have a HYPER SEX DRIVE and become so bonded to men that I want it all the time once it starts. 

Anyways we banter back and forth and I lead him to the bed room. I start getting excited and tell him about a fantasy I had that involved having sex at the movies. We agree to go next weekend. He starts undressing and says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt last long‚Äù. We had sex I left. 

Well anyways the next day, I was so horny and turned on.. I sent him a dirty text. He responds ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù. I make a direct statement that I wanted to see him that night. He tells me Sorry. I‚Äôm working. What movie do you want to see this weekend? ..(to have sex at) 

I‚Äôm taking a step back here and now I feel kind of used a little. Like I was basically pestered into sex after giving hints then out right saying I had anxiety about the situation. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear enough about the act of sex being too much for me regardless of his intentions. But now I feel like.. how does a man get to say No once and the conversation is over. But if I say no. Then I get pestered and worn down. 


I feel used and don‚Äôt feel like the power is mutual. Am I overreacting?

TLDR: dating a new guy. We‚Äôve recently started having sex. I said no to sex on my birthday and he pestered me until I did. I asked for sex the following day. He said no and that was that. I‚Äôm feeling used. Am I overreacting?"
dating_advice,How fast?,I want to see/know points of views on how long it takes for you to move on from a relationship either short or long and why.?
dating_advice,Your Dating Struggles,"Hey [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dating/)dating\_advice members!

I'm looking to hear from IT professionals, engineers, or any other young professional who A) spends long hours working in front of a computer OR B) works in a highly male-dominated industry.

If you're a guy in one of these industries, I want to know what are some of the biggest frustrations you're facing in attracting and finding a girlfriend.

That being said, I've identified a couple frustrations/problems that have come up over and over again and want to know if you agree with them and have something to add. Here are a couple I've compiled so far:

* ""They're aren't any good women in my city/town/village to date. All the good ones are taken""

You don't believe women in your area have anything to offer you. The couple women you've met in your area have some quality you don't like about them and you've discounted all women who are similar to that. i.e. ""All the women in San Francisco are rude""

&amp;#x200B;

* ""I'm not rich/attractive/successful/handsome enough to get a great girl. I need to focus on \[x\] first, THEN I can start dating.""

You're likely more introverted, shy, ""nerdy"" than most on average. So you also tend to think that you have to improve one area of your life (i.e lose 10 lbs, get a promotion, or upgrade your wardrobe) before you can talk to the women than you want.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""I don't have any time to date, I'm too busy working all of the time.""

You likely and will often find yourself spending way more than 40 hours a week in the office working on fixing problems, putting out fires, or dealing with meetings and upper management. This leads to burn out, stress, fatigue, and simply not having any desire to go put yourself out there.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""I use online dating but it never really pans out.""

You find it difficult to meet women that you want to date organically, through work or daily life. As a result, you tend to rely on Tinder, Hinge, Plenty-of-Fish which are way more work than reward.

You spend a lot of time feeling frustrated, confused, and annoyed with dating apps, and don't really know where to go to meet a new girl outside of these online platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

Leave a comment if you agree and resonate with any of these frustrations and have something to add, or want to vent about your current situation."
dating_advice,I think I messed up!!,"I (19F) met a guy I‚Äôve come to like on tinder (20M). I‚Äôve never dated before/been in a relationship. 

So, I really like this guy. We have a lot in common and I enjoyed our dates. We‚Äôve met twice but I haven‚Äôt initiated anything, and I‚Äôm really not great at communicating. Whenever he snaps I‚Äôm afraid to open it, and when he texts I end up overthinking what to say back. I think it‚Äôs because I really like him and I don‚Äôt want to screw anything up. 

And like?? On top of it all, I got nervous on our first date and lied about being a vegetarian because he was too. Then I started talking about chicken nuggets, so he definitely knows I was lying but didn‚Äôt bring it up. Not sure why he‚Äôs still snapping/talking to me but I think I‚Äôm the one with red flags. I feel like I should let him go just so he doesn‚Äôt have to deal with me anymore lol. He‚Äôs funny, attractive and really nice. I‚Äôm really into him but I think I‚Äôve messed everything up agh (he could be thinking what else am I lying about!!). Do I confront him about it? Why am I like this üò´ We haven‚Äôt texted since the 2nd date, but have been sending some snaps back and forth. 

This is more like a ‚ÄúI know I messed up‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI think I messed up.‚Äù 

Advice or anything is appreciated!!"
dating_advice,If a girl DM‚Äôs you first...,"...does that mean it‚Äôs on!? This is on Instagram. Never met her in person. She followed me first(not sure how she found me). Consistently watches all of my stories. And then slid into my DM a few days ago by replying to one of my stories. And has done so a couple times since. 

Found out via our brief DM conversations that she lives really close to me. 

Soooo....should I ask her out or something? Or is this just someone that thinks I have a cool Instagram?"
dating_advice,Am I over thinking this?,"So met this guy (m28) who owns a tattoo shop and while he has been tattooing my (f23) half sleeve we have gotten to know each other. This has been over several sessions. The other night after he had finally finished my tattoo completely, we kissed then moved at lightning speed almost having sex right there in his shop. Moments away from us beginning to have sex I told him I didn't want to in his shop and I invited him to come to my house the following week once my company had left and I'd rock his world in a real bed.. things were going great then (today) 2 days before my company leaves he just vanishes no texts at all.. should I wait to contact him agian? I've reached out twice, Is he over it? Thoughts appreciated."
dating_advice,I am having an hard time labelling feelings for some reason,"I have anxiety and overthink a lot so it's hard for me to focus on anything else...

I tend to be very rational and want to put labels on things etc but I know humans are complex.

Right after I met this guy I immediately thought I wanted to have sex but I wasn't fully sure until 2nd date. I realized the sexual tension was strong later on and I was constantly thinking about having sex even I knew a long term relationship wasn't going to happen because we were too different and didn't click in that sense.

It was evident he was attracted to me but didn't want to date because we were not compatible or too different etc but the tension was strong, I suggested fwb which was very out of character from me but he didn't think it was a good idea.
He said he wanted to get to know me and was very into the personal stuff he wanted me to talk about (personal issues etc).
We had other convos about it and he said he gets attached quickly to people, I only wanted sex and he wanted to be friends not just that.

I wanted to keep a distance for good reason but he was dramatic about it, he didn't know if he wanted to be only friends then and I asked multiple times if he was still interested.

Later on he was wishy washy and became distant for a few weeks until I thought he was done. He always dismissed when I asked and said he wouldn't have texted me or asked me out anymore if he wasn't interested.
He initiated most texts and dates though he didn't want to see me too often.
He had a phase when he saw each other once a month for 2 months.

At some point he started acting all nice and became more consistent, texted me first more and wanted to see me at least 1 or 2 times a week or every 10 days.

He became more affectionate and kissed me, then we did foreplay once.

His increased interest calmed my anxiety because I didn't know what to think. I wasn't even sure if I wanted a long term relationship and I feel like we didn't a spark.
He didn't want any labels and said he liked way too much or whatever when I asked. Then ""idk if I love you we will see"" ok wtf

After one intimate encounter he said he had tons of physical involvement and little mental or emotional. He also claimed to be depressed for his own reasons.
He wasn't in love, he had an emotional involvement that didn't turn into love even though he wasn't indifferent and he wasn't  emotionally involved enough.

He wanted to continue but I felt bad because I had a bad gut feeling. 
Last time we saw each other I convinced him to tell me the truth and he said it was sometimes good and sometimes bad, we didn't a future as bf/gf and we didn't have intimacy or a connection.
Overall there were things he didn't like but he continued to get himself to like them (this part is bad and problematic) and wanted to find stuff in common.

It made sense but some things he said confused me. He said if he was in love I was going to be in his mind all the time (first thing in the morning bla bla bla) and I would be the center of his thoughts or he would feel anxious about not hearing from me. This made me feel like he wasn't  excited at all but during chats I felt a bit dull sometimes.
He said I didn't look enthusiastic in general too.

He  said spending time together wasn't forced or it would not make sense he had a very great time in the past weeks but he made it seem like he wasn't excited about it even on a superficial level.
It's true that we didn't have many things to talk about.

He blocked me everywhere and refused to be friends regardless, he was also rude about it.

For me it was a big source of anxiety tbh, I keep thinking about sex and how much I would like to fuck him even if we don't connect on a deeper level.

Some attachment was there though.

What the hell was this? Lust? Infatuation? I thought we were getting more into it because he seemed more interested and I was too then it took a turn. Generally people who are infatuated are crazy about each other at least at first.
Here the whole thing was weird.

The attraction was there and he said it wasn't because of my looks or because he didn't like kissing etc the foreplay was reckless but very natural etc

It lasted nearly 5 months and we had 10 dates in total.

He added he really cared about me but he was an asshole about it in the end and pretty much said I was annoying him with my issues and he was tired of dealing with them, also no things to talk about aside from my problems."
dating_advice,First date ever (22M),"I have no idea what to do on an official date. I‚Äôll give a  bit of background. I started talking to this girl in one of my classes and after walking out the second week, I asked if I could buy her a coffee. 

Me: ‚ÄúCould I buy you some coffee? You seem friendly and I‚Äôd like to get to know you better.‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúReally? Of course, are you free now?‚Äù

We walked inside one of the campus buildings, got our coffee, and just chatted. I really loved the conversation we had. We had a good back and forth dialogue, she seemed genuinely interested, and I was very comfortable talking to her. Before actually buying coffee, she had mentioned to me she has never been on a date before. I was shocked because she‚Äôs very attractive and chill to talk to. So halfway through our coffee conversation, I throw this out there.

Me: ‚ÄúI would love to have dinner with you this week. Would you be interested?‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúSeriously? Yes, that would make my day.‚Äù

So long story short, she gave me her number and now we are going to dinner in 2 days. I have very little experience in this field so I don‚Äôt know what to do."
dating_advice,Tinder girl,So this girl that i met on tinder back in August just followed me back on Instagram after basically cutting me off and unfollowing me on everything saying it won‚Äôt work out. What does this mean?
dating_advice,Should I unfollow his IG &amp; delete number to forget him quicker?,"So someone has lost interested although I already got attached which sucks. We still talked but I know we are not going out anymore. Anyway, I need to move on. His IG account is private so if I unfollow him i wont be able to see more updates. I'm thinking if I should delete his number as I keep checking when he is last online on whatsapp. And everytime his status says online, my heart just beats so fast. This is sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if he will find me rude if he finds out I unfollowed him on IG. But at the moment I can't be platonic friend with him as I still like him. Maybe we can be friends when I get over him but right now everything about him just keeps me from getting over him. It's like quitting drugs. My self-control is failing....

&amp;#x200B;

So guys, what do you think?"
dating_advice,"Guys, I need your advice about dating?","I'm a 26F and guys I need advice about putting myself out there, I guess I fear being rejected, not being good enough or pretty enough. I don't know why, but I base a lot of things on looks verses a personality. So in my mind I will think a guy won't be attracted to me, so therefore he won't try and get to know me. I think the reason why I don't feel good enough when it comes to dating is because guys don't ever talk to me. So then I feel like why bother trying, but at the same time I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I'm 26 all my friends are getting married or their already married and having kids."
dating_advice,Did I miss my chance?,"I've got a dilemma and feel like I've missed my opportunity. There's a girl that works across the street from my store and she seems to be flirty but I'm not really sure. Anyway, there was an ice breaker in the conversation the other day about us having the same birthday and I didn't jump on inviting her to do something sometime. How would I go about trying do ask her out  without the opportunity of an ice breaker."
dating_advice,Should I just drop it or actually persue her.... I'm lost,"Long story short I started talking to a girl in college who is the closest that anyone else has gotten to a 10 in my experience. She has the style, personality, charisma, good sense of humor, &amp; she is gorgeous. But we stopped talking 2 days ago cause I told her that I was gonna focus on my purpose &amp; not focus on the games that she wanted to play &amp; she didn't respond to it. We always cross paths with each other b/c both of our classes are in the same building. Everytime she sees me she starts fidgeting while I just keep walking my way like if she wasn't there. I know she is not one to be fidgeting like that because the times that I saw her around campus she would just walk &amp; not really pay attention to anything else like she just has presence &amp; focus that's what attracted me to her. Even tho I don't let anyone see it I'm honestly just dying on the inside cause to me she's the one &amp; I really haven't felt like this about anyone in like 4 years. Why? B/c girls are just too bland &amp; always put me in a pedestal. I honestly don't know what to do... Like she got me soo fucked up. 

Okay so it all started when she started checking me out as I was heading to class, after the 3rd time of her doing this I approached her &amp; we exchanged snapchat but we rarely talk. Couple days later I saw her again &amp; we went to the library &amp; talk for a couple hours for 3 days straight so after that I told her that I was gonna take her out to get some food &amp; watch a movie, as I was doing this she got close to me &amp; started hugging me &amp; got all touchy towards me. A day before the actual date she gave me her phone number &amp; we started texting but she flake on me. So I decided to stop talking to her until the next day where I shot her a text but she didn't wanna talk to me. She said ""you only talk to me when you wanna talk to me"" but I still saw her at campus &amp; she played hard to get but after a couple mins she gave a real hug &amp; wrapped her legs around my waist. But then she kept texting me to not talk to her &amp; not to approach her anymore. But Id still go up to her &amp; talk to her cause her actions told me that she was really interested in me. One day she got really frustrated with me cause I kepy bugging her b/c I just wanted to talk to her just so we can either keep talking or just drop it. She gave me a kiss that day. In person she would tell me that yeah she wanted to keep talking to me &amp; that we were gonna talk but in text she would tell me to stop bothering her.
After both of us getting annoy at each other we said that we were gonna drop it &amp; not contact each other but I knew that in that time frame I didn't put enough effort into talking to her so I actually wanted to ""try"" with her &amp; stuff so I managed to save it &amp; we kept talking over the weekend with me actually putting in the effort everything was going soooo smooth like I was replying to her withing a recent time frame instead of completely ignoring her like I used to. 

She would always send me good morning &amp; good night texts. She told me to go meet her parents in a jokingly way cause I asked her to let me see a family pic so I could see if they looked related. She told me the reasons as to why she wanted to get to know me. Like she told me that she noticed me cause of my style, how attractive I am, &amp; just how focus I was when I was at the library. &amp; then she told me that she wanted to talk to me cause she looked up to how smart I am, my sense of humor, my sweetness, my confidence, my patience, my persistency &amp; my drive. Like people have told me this before but just how affectionate the hugs that she would give me would just show me that she actually meant it &amp; that she is proud of me b/c of all of that. She would always be so focus on the conversations that we had even tho she knew nothing about the subject she would ask me question &amp; she would just let me talk about what I'm passionate about. She always been so nervous that it's hard for her to make eye contact with me. When we would hang out it was just me &amp; her like no distractions like she has plenty of dudes wanting to be with her but she wouldn't even pull out her phone. We would tease each other when we would talk &amp; just have an amazing conversation.

At first I didn't really put in the effort b/c I just thought that she wasn't that interested in me. &amp; I think that's why she kept telling me to not talk to her just cause I was only replying to her when I felt like it &amp; I didn't really try to have a conversation with her. 

Thanks for taking the time to sit to my vent, Im honestly not that close to anyone has who has life experiences that can actually give me some good advice. Like I can talk to my friends about career choices &amp; self improvement but when it comes to relationships it's dry."

dating_advice,I don't know what to do,"          I don't know if I'm too young to be in this community but this was my last resort. So I am currently 13 and in the eighth grade and I got a girlfriend about a month ago. We have the same classes and all so there are plenty of chances to be around her. However my only problem is that I don't have to confidence to talk to her. Im literally going crazy over her and I can't stop thinking about her. I keep telling myself to grow some balls, suck it up and go talk to her, i even watched some videos for advice and I try the tips they give me but nothing works. I can't help but worry that she is loosing feelings and with this being my first girlfriend I think I have fallen in love with her. Every day when I get home from school I'm having mental breakdowns and I'm over it. I just want to talk to her end feel what it's like to be in a normal relationship. I feel like we're just friends. I don't know what is wrong with me."
dating_advice,Messaging on Snapchat?,"I (M, 28) liked and messaged a girl (26) on OkCupid and added her on Snapchat as well, since she had her username listed on her profile.

I feel like my message on OKC was rather bland, but I think we have a lot in common and I hope she looks beyond my bland message at my profile and sees how similar we are. My question is, do you think I should say something to her on Snapchat? I know people don't always visit OKC all that often, so I didn't know if this was a good idea, especially since my OKC message sucked."

dating_advice,Are there still any chances?,"At start sorry that this post comes from second account, but some mates know my main account and I don't exactly want them to know about this post. I am 20 years old male on my first year on university. There's this one girl that I kinda liked since the beginning, but I've got crush on her later on. We didn't talk much until December when I started to like her more and more, with one party before Christmas when i officially noticed that im crushing on her. I started texting her at the beginning of January and we had a few long conversations, even until late night, about our classess, hobbys, TV series, etc., and about us in general, so we learnt a bit about each other. But there's this thing that she never did text first, I was the one to initiate most conversations, but she indeed seemed interested in talk, we had a lot of laugh and she responded (mostly) regularly. On university we still talked sometimes (there isn't really that much time for it, also she mostly spends time with her 2 friends). After almost 2 weeks of conversations i have to decided to try and ask her if she would like for some coffee (I offered either next day or day after, because later on our exams started and we have a rough 2 weeks of learning, so I thought we may go before it all starts). She responded that unfortunately she doesn't have time this week (as I said, exams were soon and she always rushes for tram and then train to get home asap).

 Then I asked her when would possibly be fine for her, aa she followed with ""possibly after exam session, and that it is hard to currently plan something"". So ok, I decided to give her and myself some space before exams (we are still in exam session) so I stopped texting for a few days, with exceptions like our uni subjects or birthday wishes. She still didn't write first.

 But there's another thing. I thought that everything is the same as it was after my question, but then I started feeling more and more like an air next to her. I have to state that few of my friends say that im overthinking and overreacting a lot of things, but well, i don't feel the same around her now. Im feeling like in group talks she doesn't actually listen to me as before, and if I ask her for something like how did the exam go or just for solution for exercise, I have to ask her 2 or 3 times before she replies, even though im literally not that far away from her. While chatting we have decided that we will do sober challenge up until the end of exams, and then there was this plan for the group party where we will hopefully talk after all the stress ends, but im concerned if it will be the same as it was supposed to be (Im planning to ask her once more after that). But question is, is she atleast kinda interested or was she just being nice, am I really overthinking so much and is there chance for this date to happen? Thanks for all the feedback in advance."
dating_advice,Past Trauma/Bad Times and Dating again,"I would like to have an open discussion with how everyone feels about trauma and dating again. Here's the scenario (yes something I'm going through)

Basically my last relationship lasted about 6-8 months, ended early 2018. She was emotionally manipulative in many ways, and that gave me major trust issues with most girls, amongst other things. She would insult me  (ex: being ""childish"" when I was just simply showing emotion, or even being called too emotional in a negative way). She would also yell at me certain times when I did something wrong, made me feel bad when I couldnt do something for her, the list goes on and on. She was allowed to do certain things, but I wasn't. To top it off, she was extremely selfish too. Basically, she mad me feel like shit and also emotionally cheated on me like crazy. But my point is, she fucked me up for about 2 years. 

Fast forward, I did some grieving and a lot of healing. I dated around for about year figuring out what I wanted etc etc. I've also been much happier with life,  mentally and physically treating myself good these past few months. I feel amazing in my own company, not relying on anyone either, I feel I used to be very codependent. Now, recently I've been into this one girl. I am much better at communication and somewhat handling my emotions in situations. Trust me when I say we really click well, its soothing and calm, happy and flows easy. However, today I started to see some of my \~trauma\~ coming forth. I had a pretty bad day due to some home stuff, and I started to overthink and let my emotions get the best of me. I started to immediately think that this new girl was playing me, just as my ex did. Now, dont get it confused, I trust this girl. That's actually why I'm comfortable enough to even take her out, I wouldnt be wasting my own time if I felt like she wasnt worth dating. Nor am I comparing her to my ex, because let's be real... she's truly incomparable. It's just that when my emotions get the best of me, I start to overthink with her too. And my mind starts to feel like how it was with my ex. This doesnt happen often though... today's actually the only time it's happened. 

Now my question is NOT whether I should be with this girl or not. That's my decision I feel, so I'd appreciate if that's respected. My discussion here is to see how people personally feel about dating again after some time healing from a bad ex. Especially the first ""real"" relationship, and not just casual dating/hookups. Did any bad trauma come forth for you guys too? Can anyone else relate to what I went through? How did you deal with it? How did you open up to someone new about your past without scaring them off? any advice? lol anything that's on your mind regarding this topic, I would love to hear it."
dating_advice,Am I being ridiculous? His ex..,"I have been dating my gorgeous (now boyfriend) for almost 10 months now. 
We had a little bit of a rocky start because he was scared of commitment because his ex fucked him over before me.. we‚Äôve been officially together for about 4 months now. 
at the very beginning of it all he told me that he and his ex are still friends and they share a mutual friendship group, to which I was okay with because he gave me no reason not to trust him.. about 3 months in he went to breakfast with  his ex and told me after the fact, that really really hurt me. There were things that didn‚Äôt add up back then, like he was so hurt by her which is why he cut seeing all his friends.. but he‚Äôll go eat one on one with her? Anyway I decided to forgive him and move on even though it didn‚Äôt make sense.. 
fast forward until a few weeks ago when somehow she got bought up again (I feel like I held a lot of anger about what happened because I never really got the answers) and I pushed the fact again that I thought it was weird and it eventually came out that ‚Äúhe met up with her to see if he still had feelings for her‚Äù to which he reassured me he did not and since then he has given me 100%. What he did is shitty and It‚Äôs hard to build a foundation when the ground is already shakey.. he is a genuine guy, I trust him as much as I can considering what happened.. besides that, our relationship has been perfect and he‚Äôs shown no red flags.. besides moving at a snail pace but that‚Äôs fine with me...

Anyway, he posted a video of him riding his bike with his nephew and his ex liked it... and instantly I feel angry and upset and immediately want to shut him out.. I know he has no control over what she does.. and I probably should just get over it.. but I honestly didn‚Äôt have an issue with them being friends but now after everything I guess I do.. I feel insecure about it and I feel like he created that insecurity. 
I haven‚Äôt met his nephew yet or his brother or anyone other than his mum and dad and I feel like she got to meet them all and she has met his nephew and I‚Äôm paying for her mistakes...

Do I bring it up with him and tell him it makes me uncomfortable to vent and get it off my chest or do I just not mention it and try and move on? 
I understand he probably can‚Äôt delete her as they all share a mutual friendship group so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll see her eventually at events or whatever but I just want to vent.. 

She only found out I existed October-ish of last year and I feel like since then she‚Äôs felt a sting and been more active in his life.. like randomly she felt the need to apologise to him after she found out I existed... like she had 2 years prior to that to apologise.. 

I don‚Äôt know; 
Am I being stupid?"

dating_advice,"She's not looking for anything serious &amp; me not getting it up, next steps","Reddit Friends, need some advice.

I‚Äôve seen bits and pieces of this issue, but nothing as this unique? 

I met a girl through mutual friends, got drunk and she came back to my place (I'm 31M, she's 27F). However, she said she didn‚Äôt want to have sex as we just met, and I respected that, so we just chilled. The next day, I got her a cab, and then continued to text her for a 2 weeks before setting up a first date. On the first date, we meet at a bar and things went excellent, convo was very fluid, making eye contact &amp; being physical. She told me she wanted to go back to my place, she even packed her overnight bag‚Ä¶ so she was prepared to have sex on the first date.  Awesome.

We go back to my place, have a drink, started making out, moved to the bedroom and everything escalated, got her off and the whole time had an erection. But as I went to put on the condom, I couldn‚Äôt sustain that erection. I wasn‚Äôt nervous in the slightest, so I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs because she was biting my lip really hard (not used to that), or the request to choke her out, or maybe I to pee ‚Äì or fuck, maybe I masturbate to much? 

I felt defeated after that, and we just ended up spooning, she spent the night and we chilled the next morning for 3 hours (she was also totally comfortable walking around naked in the AM). As she left, I got nervous and asked, ‚Äúso where do you see this going,‚Äù and she responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for anything serious right now.‚Äù  She did mention she's might be open to hang out next week (was this a pitty response?), and during our initial date, she had mentioned about doing things together, so now I‚Äôm confused from everything? I texted her later that night, saying I did have a good time despite everything and said it would be great to hang out again. I know she‚Äôs a bad texter, but hasn‚Äôt texted anything back &amp; I‚Äôm likely to leave everything in her court now.

So question is, did I spook her at the end about ‚Äúdating‚Äù or did she lose all sexual interest after I went whiskey dick?  Was she only looking to have sex?  I like this girl, so are there any ""good"" next steps?  

Would be interested in any constructive advice, or other similar experiences from guys/girls!"

But bc I‚Äôm not 100% against firearms, is it that big of a deal if he‚Äôs a responsible owner?

dating_advice,I think I [25m] f*cked up by getting too aggressive with this girl I like [23f] and don‚Äôt know how to proceed,"Met this girl a month or two ago and we kind of hit it off, I asked her out and we‚Äôve now been on a couple dates over the last month. 

Recent date this past weekend, we went to a local beer tasting event and we were having a great time. Towards the end of the night we were kind of drunk (not hammered) and still having a good time although I guess it seemed like here attitude changed. In my head I was thinking maybe she was tired after a couple hours of standing/drinking in heels or maybe she just wasn‚Äôt that into me...

Anyways she quickly agrees to go to a bar nearby for a last drink and again have a good time there. as were waiting for her uber home, my idiot semi-drunk self asks if she‚Äôd want to come back to my place for a night cap instead. She (unsurprisingly) says no she has yoga in the morning, which she told me about prior to the event. 

I say ok with some attempt at a playful ‚Äòare you sure‚Äô kind of thing and then (kind of aggressively) go in for a kiss, which she gives me but it was definitely awkward and didn‚Äôt feel right. 

Now I kind of feel like I not only ruined my chances but also just feel like an asshole and don‚Äôt know how to proceed? Do I apologize? Or do I just act like nothings happened and let it fizzle if it‚Äôs going to fizzle?"
dating_advice,Is dating someone with no intention of going exclusive morally questionable?,"I went on a few dates with this very attractive girl, it's fun but I can pretty much tell right off the bat she is not the type I am interested in as girlfriend material. So now I'm just daring her for the fun of it also just because I don't yet know anyone who I want to be with long term.

On one hand I have a vague feeling that this is morally questionable. I grew up in a family with very traditional moral views, and a relationship without the purpose of working towards marriage is frowned upon.

While on the other hand, I couldn't find anything wrong with such a relationship, as long as both parties are enjoying it. In fact there is no way to tell my ""intention"" unless I confess it. In other words, it is impossible to distinguish a relationship that I decided to end at the very end because of a flagging of energy and a relationship I never intended to lead to marriage.

More over this question just feels so stupid when people around me are doing ONS all the time. Strangely enough after I started actually dating girls, I found them a lot open to sex than they appeared...but that's off topic."
dating_advice,When is the right time to ask a girl out?,[removed]
dating_advice,(31M) I really screwed up in life. What am I to do with myself now?,"So, I've never been able to get a dating life going. Actually, I knew I was going to struggle with that, so I opted to spend my 20s focusing instead on trying to establish myself in general. School, work, whatever. Sadly, though, I was a bit of a flop. My education led me nowhere, and I spent my 20s working low end jobs, making less than a livable wage. As much as it pains me on a personal level to say it, I still live at home.

On the somewhat bright side, I'm starting to approach the bare minimum level of income to be able to completely sustain myself. But, I predict that, at minimum, it'll probably be another year, year and a half, before I think I can move out and confidently sustain myself. And that means I can't even attempt to START trying to date until then, because I obviously know that a guy in his 30s living at home is pretty much the most unappealing thing in the world.

And I'm just not really sure how to deal with that frustrating sense of loneliness in the meantime. Not to mention, what if it's even longer? What if my plan gets derailed, and I'm still at home for the next two years or more? What if I decide I need to return to school to improve my situation, and then that bumps it up to 4+ years to complete my schooling and find a better career? It just seems so far away, and it's really disparaging. I can't help feeling a sense of loneliness, but I don't get to date because I screwed myself over. What am I to do with myself?"
dating_advice,Very confused,"So im in a situation that is very confusing right now. Theres this girl that ive had the crush on for the longest time and I see her basically everyday because of school and track and we hang out sometimes after school. I really want to be in a relationship with her, but theres something in the way. Her friends have always been telling me that she likes me, but she is confused. Apparently the thing shes confused about is that there is another guy she kind of likes as well and shes confused (according to her friends). Yesterday, i finally told her i liked her and I asked if she felt the same way back and she replied ""I don't know"" while smiling and a faint laughter. Im very confused on what to do next."

dating_advice,Should I try to change my date plans?,"So I met a girl about a week ago in college and we‚Äôve been talking ever since. She gave me all the signs that she was interested in me and was very willful to give me her number once I actually asked her the day we met in class. Sometimes she takes long to respond to my text messages, but she DOES respond and she responds wholly, not with just one word replies and she keeps the conversation going. When we last went on a lunch date we got pretty personal about our own business so I do know that she is genuinely busy and may not have the time to respond to my text like I want her to. But anyways, last weekend I asked her out but she got tanked with work and babysitting. She‚Äôs in a bit of a financial situation that we discussed. I asked her on Monday if she‚Äôd have time for me this week or weekend and she said she would see if she can call off of work on either Friday or Saturday so that we can do some things that we discussed. 

My thing is, I low key went to take her on a formal date. But me being military, she‚Äôs never fired or even held a gun before. I brought up the idea of going to a gun range so she could shoot and she LOVED that. The look in her eyes was priceless. She really wants to go do that, but I feel like the range won‚Äôt build that romantic tension that I want. She‚Äôs fully aware that I like her, but she‚Äôs taking things particularly slow on the relationship side. Should I try to change our plans to something more intimate, or should we just go to the range which is what she is REALLY excited for?"
dating_advice,I am too scared to have sex because it will hurt and I'm fat and ugly. What should I do?,"I'm almost 25 and a virgin. I have had guys ask me if I'll have sex with them and I tell them no. There was this guy that I really liked for a long time and he asked me once if we could fuck when I was giving him head and I said no. I kind of wanted to but I get too scared and can't go through with it. I mean I want to have sex but I'm scared it will hurt or I'll get pregnant and they'll leave me. I know if you're wet enough it will hurt less but I can't even get wet and I won't let a guy go down to do it for me. One time this guy kept trying to take my jeans off and I held onto them so he couldn't get them off. He did finger me through the zipper part for a few seconds but it hurt and tickled so bad I told him to stop. 


I'm pretty fat and I don't want a guy to see me naked. A couple guys begged to see my boobs and I wouldn't let them see because I don't want them to see my disgusting body. I mean if I got naked in front of a guy he would probably scream and run away or puke. I have a skin problem where I have these red sore things on my stomach and chest.
