relationship_advice,Am I paranoid about my relationship?,"So me and my other half have been together 2/3 years now and we’ve had a lot go off in our past and I’m talking him speaking to other girls face to face as well as over stuff like tinder etc which we had a break for and I decided it was time to move on and try again because I loved him, and we’ve argued a lot recently about his actions when he’s with his “work friends” like him stripping naked on a table on a night out and him not coming home when he told me he was coming home when I was poorly (I’ve never stopped him going out or controlled what he does I just want him to respect me and our relationship and put me first)! Tonight he told me he was working at 8:30 and left to get the 7:25 bus which was fine but he’s not text me back at all since leaving for the bus which worries me because our area has had stabbings etc so I like to know if he’s ok and that he’s safe but he has an iPhone and his iMessages aren’t going through it’s going through as text like his phone is switched off or his data is off? His phone has done nothing but be under his pillow every night and when we argued he changed his passcode and took my Face ID off his phone which means I can’t get on it. Now I asked him for his password last night 30/1/20 and he said no and basically said that we wasn’t doing it where we go through each other’s phones anymore which I understand why, but I wanted to go through it for my own peace of mind just so I know Im out of the rocky part we’ve had lately. Now I don’t know if I’m being silly and paranoid but I feel as though he’s meeting other girls, he was late home Thursday from work they close as 3am and he got home for 5:45am? It doesn’t take that long to close a bar I know from experience but he made up some shitty excuse etc. I just don’t know what to do or even think right now! Please help me"
relationship_advice,Unsure of how to reveal unusual fetishized to girlfriend,"Okay, so this may make me seem like a creeper, which is why I’m afraid to have this discussion with my girlfriend. In short, for reasons not entirely clear to me, I get very aroused when my girlfriend gets inebriated. The concept of her slowly going from sober to sloppy, slurring drunk turns me on like crazy.

Unfortunately, I am worried that she will perceive me as some kind of predator who wants to take advantage of drunk women. That’s never been my MO. I’ve never engaged in a ONS with a drunk girl, and I would never try to push boundaries of someone who is intoxicated. I’ve had drunk sex with my girlfriend before, but we already breached the topic of consent beforehand, so I know that my girlfriend is okay with drunk sex. The thing is, though, she has no idea how into it I am.

Does anyone else have this kink or know someone who does? How have you dealt with it?"
relationship_advice,I (17F) am super embarrassed by a conversation with my friend (17M) and don't know how to respond,"My friend and I both go to the same high school, and we're pretty close friends. He's been in a relationship for a couple of months while I've been with my boyfriend for over a year, so we're just friends and nothing more. Earlier today when I was talking to him, he said something to me about how masculine I am and how I always act like a dude. After this I said to him, ""yeah every guy says that but then they all end up having sex with me."" I thought this was pretty obvious sarcasm as I've only had two boyfriends, with my current one being my only serious relationship. After I said this, however, he told me, ""no offense but you're not my type at all."" This really confused me and I had no clue how to respond. I wasn't trying to flirt with him at all, that's just our mutual sense of humor. Besides, I have no feelings for him, and I'm extremely happy with my current boyfriend. He seemed serious when he said it, too. I've felt bad about it all day and don't want him to think I'm trying to make a move on him. I don't know if I should text him to tell him I didn't mean it that way at all, or if it'd make this even more awkward. Should I apologize to him or at least bring it up to him? Or should I let it go?"
relationship_advice,How do you feel about your SO watching porn?,"I typically don’t have an issue with it in general. But my bf, in my opinion, watches and looks at porn excessively. It’s practically every night, almost like he can’t sleep without seeing images of naked women. It also bothers me that he looks at images on Reddit, which are images of real girls and not just porn stars. Watching porn a few nights a week at most from pornstars is different to me then looking at images that real females post of themselves nightly. I see it as if he were really that into me then he wouldn’t be looking, like he has a wandering eye. I’ve mentioned my thoughts and concerns to him before and his response was that he wasn’t changing and it was my own issues that I need to figure out. But my issue isn’t that he watches porn, my issue is the frequency and the platforms he chooses. What are your thoughts on this and what would you do?"
relationship_advice,My (25 M) gf (24 F) uses too much toilet paper and I don’t know how to ask her to use less while being understanding.,"Obligatory, I am posting this on a new account because my girlfriend is on reddit constantly and it’s on my phone so sorry for spelling and grammar errors.

To start this out my girlfriend is from a family where her dad only cared about money. It bothered her so much all the time and she has a bad relationship with her Dad and this is definitely a factor of that. This is necessary information for later in this post. 

So we have been dating for 4 years and living together for 2. Since we’ve been living together I have noticed how fast we blow through toilet paper. When I say fast I mean it’s literally a full roll a day at some times. So a 24 pack is gone within a month almost every time. It’s not a huge deal for me other than the fact that I barely use any and I just think it’s absurd the amount that’s used. We have also had problems because of the amount she uses, she has had some issues with clogging toilets at friends and families house (like my best friend who didn’t own a plunger and had to buy one). 

With that being said I have tried to hesitantly bring this up and she gets very angry and claims it’s a money thing like her dad would always tell her. It is partially but really I just think that we just need to stop using so much to avoid the awkward plunger talk and in situations where it’s limited we only use a little. Plus going through 3 rolls while at my families house always makes me feel bad. 

With all that being said I know it’s much different for guys then girls in that department and I just can’t really speak to a lot of that. So how do I bring this up to her in a way that doesn’t sound insensitive and that she will respond well to?"
relationship_advice,Why is he (30m) all of a sudden acting like he was never interested in me (24f)?,"Just to start: I know that cheating is horrible. That’s not what I want advice about. 

I started working at my current employer almost a year ago. Around a month in me and a coworker “Ryan” really hit it off. We became really fast friends but only friends at first because I was in a relationship. 

We hung out more and more and he would always tell me how much he liked me and that work was better with me around. I eventually found myself having a huge crush on him but I drew boundaries in my head. 

Right before Christmas, we were hanging out having a few drinks when he kisses me. I kissed him back at first but stopped it as the guilt of being in a relationship got to me. 

When we talked about it afterwards he made comments like asking me if I wanted to be with him and if I was single that he would want to date me. 

I pushed it aside (which was my first mistake) and we went back to being friends. 2 weeks ago we were hanging out with a bunch of people at a party when eventually it was just us. We ended up having sex. 

I broke up with my SO as soon as it happened as I couldn’t live with the guilt. 

When I told Ryan, he seemed super regretful and apologized. When I told him how I felt about him and how much I still liked him, he said that he didn’t want a relationship right now and he doesn’t know why he always does something he regrets with me. I wasn’t pushy or anything as I said that I understood that it was messy but I wanted to take it slow and see where it goes. He didn’t respond to this. 

I thought maybe he was just a little freaked out that it all happened so fast so I’ve kept up hope. 

I texted him this week asking him where we stand right now and he told me that he just wants to be friends. I freaked out at him and told him that he lead me on and that he just used me for sex and that he knew what he was doing this whole time. 

He said that he realizes now that he lead me on and that he should’ve been “honest” with me from the beginning and that he just wanted to be a good friend and help me with my relationship as he could see it was “struggling.” 

But to me, how else was I supposed to interpret all these signals? They all seemed pretty clear to me that he wanted to be with me and I feel super upset and blindsided. 

What happened? 

Tl;dr: Coworker blindsided me by saying that he doesn’t have feelings for me despite all evidence to the contrary over the past few months."
relationship_advice,GF(22) has really low self esteem and it's dragging me M(21) down.,"First thing first, I love her a lot and I don't want advice ranging towards the dump her and such.

Now for the context. My GF comes from a religious family and is having problems (according to me) in the department of being comfortable with others and even me sometimes, she is clearly an introvert according to me.

 She still lives with her parents because she wants to work in the same sphere of jobs as them (they are farmer). We are both in school to learn how to become buisness managers of farms, and right there the self-confidence issues starts according to me. She has a lot of trouble feeling accepted by her groups of friends, by telling me that they don't actually care about her because when she tries to say anything she feels like she is not being listened to, like they don't care. Her friends all like her and often ask her to do stuff and to hang out but she still thinks they don't like her.

She often gets asked to do things at home that she clearly don't want to do, but does not have the guts to say no, even when I'm over and see are watching a movie. Talking about movies, her parents are almost always home and when we watch a movie that they don't think they like they ask to turn it off and to change for something they would want to watch, of course she changes. when imo they could just go do something elsewhere and not watch with us.

She often ask me about information about thing in my domain of agriculture which is hogs, while she is more about poultry. And when she does and that I answer she immediately apologize by saying that she should know that and stop disturbing me. When she does that I remind her that I don't really know about her domain either and even ask her about it too. But she still is insecure about it and it's kind of annoying. 

When she has troubles she waits that others see it instead of saying anything about it. And since she is really good at hiding her emotions it's almost impossible for others to see it. Therefore her family which should be seeing, don't and I'm the one realising that something is off about her. She always complains that I'm the only one that sees it  and her family should be able to tell before I am. Although, I would admit that it's difficult to talk about anything personal with her family since they always change the subject when they get uncomfortable.

There is plenty other situations like that. I just want an idea as to how help her with her insecurities, since I really love this girl.

TL;DR: Gf is insecure about a lot of things in her life including her friends, family and even me."
relationship_advice,How did you know when it was time to end your long term relationship?,"Been with my boyfriend/fiancé idek rn for 3 years. Got with him and stayed with him because he treated me amazingly, super respectful, very thoughtful, etc. I feel very naive for the way I loved him, it was as if I had no eyes for anyone else and the only person that mattered to me was him. The love was unconditional on my part (in terms of shallow lust) I’m very in shape 5’1 98lbs and he’s 260 at 6’1 aka he’s obese and I couldn’t have cared less. Fast forward a year and he starts very obviously rubbernecking and looking at other women while we are out. Ok this hurts, but he denied it so I tried to ignore it and stop feeling so sensitive. Then he admits that he’s definitely checked out multiple women when we are together. I’ve tried to get over it but it still hurts. Then he’s out of the blue unhappy with my natural breasts. Stops showing interest in them during sex, wants me to get a breast augmentation and offers to pay when he was previously VERY against plastic surgery, but denies that he’s ever done anything to make me feel insecure about my body. Now recently after first denying that he masturbates he finally admitted that he does ( he’s doing it at least twice a day). But he denies that he ever watches porn (another lie I’m sure). He still treats me great in other aspects, he does small thoughtful things, he texts/calls me whenever he can at work, and he doesn’t ever go out alone or act suspicious. But now I feel like my trust has deteriorated, I’m constantly feeling insecure and anxious, I’m comparing myself to pornstars that I’m sure he watches, I don’t want to go out with him or even watch movies with him if there will be pretty girls, and I don’t know how to get over this or if I should just end things. How did you know it was time to leave?"
relationship_advice,"I (24F) love animals, my boyfriend (24M) doesn’t. Should I leave?","My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years, we haven’t had any major issues except one about a year and a half into the relationship but we never broke up over it and managed to work through it just fine.

I have grown a lot as a person since dating him, in previous relationships I was needy, clingy, jealous and untrusting. Now, I’m perfectly comfortable if he wants to spend time with his friends, I often encourage it as it makes him happy. I want him to follow his passions and dreams, one of those being the army which he was very close to joining where he would have needed to move away for 18 months whilst training and we would have worked long distance. He decided against joining as he wanted to stay in our hometown and not leave his family or friends.

Recently he has found his first full time job and I think that sparked some serious thinking about our future as he has been discussing buying houses. The only problem is we had a very hard discussion (I say discussion because we don’t fight) about pets. Simply put, he only likes cats. I love cats, but I also love dogs, birds and pretty much any animal you can think of. I work in an animal shelter and volunteer at two additional rescue organisations in my spare time. I’m a vegan, and he’s a meat eater, but this doesn’t bother me as much as I believe he can make his own choices.

He has told me he can’t live with more than one dog (I currently have two - we don’t live together but one is very old) I also have rescue parrots (two gorgeous conures) and he’s said that they will have to live outside because he can’t deal with the mess (he’s very tidy). My parrots are currently indoors, they come out every day and sit with me and I love them a lot. I clean up after them all the time, but I physically can’t stop them from pooping frequently.

Animals are a HUGE part of my life, and not an important part of his. He has cats, but he says if they didn’t toilet outside he wouldn’t have them as he’s not cleaning a litter box. He wouldn’t get a dog for himself, and he actively dislikes the birds.

For the most part we otherwise get along fine. Do you guys think this animal issue is a deal breaker or can we work through it? If anyone has similar experience in this area with their partner (or ex partner) advice would be very much appreciated!

Ps: we broke up (mutually) over this for a day, he believed he couldn’t provide me with what I needed. I was so upset that I’m trying to make it work and he’s very on board with trying to make it work but I’m worried that I won’t be able to fully follow my passions. Or am I being unreasonable?"

relationship_advice,I keep accidently physically hurting my friend,"So I've been friends with this girl named Alexis for 4 years.

relationship_advice,Is it possible to lose chemistry with a serious girlfriend after not seeing her face-to-face for over a week?,"I [35m] am afraid that the next time I meet up with my girlfriend [30f] face to face, we might lose our chemistry because we haven't seen each other in over a week despite living 30 minutes away from each other in the same city. I'm not much of a texter and even when I do text, I don't feel the same level of connection that I do with her (or anyone else) in person. 

Can a serious relationship be in danger of losing chemistry when too much time passes between face-to-face meetings?"
relationship_advice,"I (15m) just need a bit of advice, I don't even know where to start.","This is my first post so idrk how to go about this. 

I'm just in need of some advice/input/etc, as the title implies.

Recently I realized that I felt like I rarely get attention or catch anyone's unless I reach out first. It feels like I have ""reverse NPC energy,"" if that makes sense? Ie, I feel like no one talks to me unless I talk to them first. 

I've found that I've been craving attention, from anyone, really. But, whenever I get it, I always end up not wanting it for some reason. I feel like I want to get closer to people but just end up pushing them away. 

I'm not the best at covering everything in one sitting, in my experience, so if anyone has any questions, please just ask and I'll try to answer as best as I can. Thanks."
relationship_advice,Did i share too much information with my family?,"Hey guys, so my bf and i have been together 4 years living together for 3, we have had some financial issues and relationship issues and have decided things are better if we both move back in with our parents, he will be an hour and a half away so we will only be able to see each other 1-2 days a week. we decided once a week we will get a hotel so we can have drinks/resturaunts(dinner), and be able to spend the night together. i was telling my parents and brother and sister my plan as to how we would see each other but i wonder if it came off as a sexual undertone? im almost 23 and havent lived with them in 5 years but the way i was raised i would never bring him to sleep at their house and i would never spend the night at his dads, but we still need quality time and to um do the deed. I figured theyre gonna wanna know if im not coming home anyway so i would have to tell them eventually but i was wondering if this was a bit too much info/had a sexual undertone to it. 

ps. they 100% know we have sex Lol"
relationship_advice,The girl I was dating left me for her ex,ThroRaThis is going to be a very long post so please bear with me. I met this girl in college and we briefly spoke once . She was dating someone back then. 4 years later I follow her insta and she accepts right away and we start talking. So I meet her for the first time outside her workplace and we hit it off. We meet on and off and she tells me she does not want me to expect anything. I was like cool lets take it with the flow. We start hanging out often and we even get intimate and make out quite often. Here is the kicker her ex has cheated on her multiple times and even on her best-friend while they were all on a trip. So she did not find out till like 2 months while the ex was two timing her . Thats when she stopped talking to him. Thats when I come in and started talking to her . So after like 2-3 weeks the ex finds out she is talking to me and hanging out with me and tries to get her back. He calls her one night and tells her that he is sorry for everything and says he cant live without her. She basically goes back and leaves me hanging. Thats the first time. She constantly messages me after a month on how she misses me etc . Etc. So one day She sees my insta story and messages me to meet her. We meet and get drunk and finally do the deed. It was amazing and she didn’t want me to leave her. When I was dropping her home she starts crying and says her ex left again. That was a red flag I should have seen all through it. So in all this to make things clear is that I live abroad and she goes to a college where the ex is in the same class and workplace with her. When I leave I basically get a text saying that she is going to go back to him as he is sorry and wants to make things work out. She leaves again. After a month I get a text and we start hitting off . She makes it clear that they ended the relationship mutually and they are just friends . So i come back for like 10 days and we basically spend all the 10 days together. On the 8th day I see a call from her ex and I pick up. He says he wants to get back and he cant live without her . She is like ignore him and that. So the ex basically satisfies his needs and once he is done he is like its only benefits no feelings. She gets devastated every time he does that. So she tells me this and says she is never leaving me. I was like okay. Now I am back here and I get a call from her saying her ex said to give him one last chance and if she doesn’t believe him he will marry her right there and that. I told her to make a decision and she basically said that she cant and she thinks he is being genuine this time on and how he did love her. I am in pieces right now as I cant digest the fact how she can do this to me. Like I literally never mattered and was basically used to make her ex jealous so he would try to get her back. How can a person go back to a piece of shit like that who has hit her and uses her physically and cheats on her multiple times . I am at loss of words really where she used to say she loved me and would never leave me. I am constantly getting texts from her saying she is sorry and to always remember that whatever happened in the last 10 days she was all genuine and all. I just dont know what to do anymore.

relationship_advice,im the first black woman that my boyfriend has dated,"he has only been with white hispanic women... because that's what he is and that's normal. i'm a black woman and i just feel insecure because i look nothing like his exes looked like and i dont think i would be his preference. i know he finds me very attractive and i've known this since we first became friends years ago, but i just can't shake this feeling. any advice?"
relationship_advice,My (20F) boyfriend (20M) refuses to go anywhere with me,"To start, I don’t mean going on dates or “couple things.” My boyfriend and I are obviously fairly young but we have been together a little over two years, live together, and we’re expecting a baby in a few weeks. 

In preparation for the baby, I have been running 
around crazy the last couple of weeks trying to get all the last minute items. BF refuses to run any of these errands with me. Fine, not his thing. I suggest he help me grocery shop or go to the laundromat. Nope. He won’t even go to Target with me to try on pants (for him!) which resulted in me making three trips to target in one day. He shows absolutely zero remorse and usually will shut down and get upset at me when I tell him that I’m tired and need help (37 weeks pregnant). He does work 3rd shift so he is often tired during the day but I try to not run errands until after he gets 6-7 hours of sleep. He will complain about being tired and working so hard and will just stay home and play xbox while do literally everything else. I do love him a lot and he works hard to support our family but i’m really tired of doing everything alone."
relationship_advice,I(M27) can’t tell if the woman(F33) I’m dating is over me or not.,"We’ve been close friends for a year and a half, both were in long term relationships for most of the friendship. The past couple months we have been seeing each other and it’s been great. 
Her last relationship ended about 6 months ago, with a long drawn out break up. She did tell me last week ‘what if he comes back?’ To which I’ve been feeling frustrated with. I do know they still speak, and he(M31) is telling her he will come back once he figures out his shit or whatever. 
She’s been distant since the last time we spoke about said ex. For context she chased me for a while before we started dating. We work together, have tons of fun, and the sex is great.
Part of me feels though that I’m convenient for right now and that she doesn’t actually like me. It’s hard to read the signals. 
She also constantly reminds me of our age difference, which I understand is a factor, although it can be frustrating.
I guess I just don’t know where I stand."
relationship_advice,me (23f) and my boyfriend (25m) desided to split and just become friends to improve on ourselves. How can I deal with my anxiety?,We live together so I see him everyday.  I'ts been really hard for me but we agreed to separate to work on ourselves.  He has anger issues and I have insecurity/dependency issues.  We used to tell each other everything and currently I have high anxiety when I don't know what he;s doing.  My room is right by the front door so whenever I here him leave I get really stressed.  What types of things can I do to relieve this stress? And how can I be comfortable when he goes out not knowing where he is?
relationship_advice,I think my dad might have sexually abused my cousin," I usually read and post comments here but posting myself is a first. Throwaway, not that I think any people in my story are on Reddit, but possibly friends etc. There are so many layers and aspects to all of this I have had to cut out **a lot**. I have tried to capture the most important pieces to my question, but happy to answer questions, elaborate and clarify if needed. 

Just some basic info first. I (27F) have two sisters (34 and 40). So, some age gaps. My mom got pregnant with my oldest sister when she was 16 and had her at 17. My dad is four years older than mom.  They got married when mom turned 18 and then went on to have my other sister and finally me. When I was four, they got divorced. Then, three years ago, a bomb was dropped in our laps. Our dad was not the biological dad of oldest sister. Mom was actually already pregnant with oldest sister when they met. Her boyfriend at the time bailed, she was keeping the baby, randomly met my dad and they fell head over heels in love. He wanted to stay with her and raise the baby as his own. Once oldest sister was born, they started the process of having dad adopt her. Bio dad was totally on board and the adoption went through around when she was one. Everyone knew this. Our grandparents, our uncles and aunts, our cousins – absolutely everyone. But us three.

It should be said that it was not our parents who broke the secret. A cousin contacted my sisters and told them. The cousin was/is very depressed, suicidal, and was dealing with very heavy issues and decided to reach out to them to talk about somethings and told them this secret. When it came out, mom confessed to everything, cried a lot, apologized over and over. Dad behaved really weird. To oldest sister he insisted she was his bio-daughter, he was sure of it. Which made no sense since he adopted her officially when she was one (we have seen the papers). He sent me and middle sister letters too, assuring us he is our bio dad and that he had bought DNA-test so he could prove it to us. But then I hear from oldest sister and cousin that he is telling people that while oldest sister for sure is his bio child, he is certain I am not his daughter. This is not something he has ever expressed to me, instead the opposite.

Then other things started to unfold. The cousin who broke the secret, she also told my sisters her own dad (our paternal aunt’s husband) had sexually abused her when she was little. My middle sister said she had suffered the same to some extent from the same person. Oldest sister made a comment to indicate as had she, and another cousin did too. Cousin and middle sister have also said they have been molested by another uncle (another one of our paternal aunt’s husband) and another family friend. These men and their wives have always had a sort of close relationship with my dad and his wife. They have get-togethers several times per years, with weekend long BBQs and parties. While I have not suffered anything really bad, I have experienced uncomfortable looks and touches from these men myself, so while I had no clue it was this bad – I was not exactly caught by surprise either. 

I also have to admit it then crossed my mind – if these men in our family which our dad hangs out with have done these kinds of things, could he have? Then last spring, middle sister said dad had drunk called her quite a bit recently. And he had said something along the lines of how if cousin B (yet another cousin) ever said they had had something together, then it was consensual. That is not how middle sister phrased it, but I honestly don’t really remember. But basically, the undertone and exact phrasing indicating our dad and cousin B had at one point had some kind of “relationship” which was supposedly consensual according to my dad. From whatever context I can’t remember, cousin B would have been a young teenager at that time and dad well into his 30s. 

I feel so fucking…I don’t know. I feel conflicted and guilty. I feel conflicted because I hate to say it, but I could see it being true. I never expected it to be true, but now that it is on the table, I feel it could true. At the same time, I feel so damn guilty – what if it is not? Middle sister does kinda hate our dad and they have been NC for many years, and well…she has been known to exaggerate, especially when emotional, sometimes (but long ago) even straight out lying. Then I feel guilty af for thinking that, because I do believe her and want to believe her in everything else she has told. But a small part of me still can’t fully commit to that. Then I have to go NC with my dad for real, he is dead to me then honestly. 

Right now I am caught in a place where I am not speaking to my dad, I have not actively told him so. I have just distanced myself. From all of my family really, but completely from him though. I have not spoken to him for real since…probably three years. And only two times briefly since then and not at all since 1.5 years. But I am getting stuck. I feel like I can’t be close with my family because of this, because I have not made up my mind. I am engaged and have been procrastinating on planning for the wedding because I don’t know how to deal with my family. If I invite my dad or not will decide the future and I can’t make that decision without knowing. I can’t ask him because he will either lie to himself or me or both of us regardless of what the truth is.

Part of me wants to reach out to this cousin B, and ask her myself. But, I know how damn inappropriate and even cruel that would be. If true, it could cause her some real trauma. Especially so out of the blue. And I can’t even make a good guess as to how she would react since we are not close, she is quite a bit older so we have never known each other that well. And the only way I know how to contact her would be via Facebook. At the same time, I can’t stop thinking about it, I feel like I have to know. I have to hear if my dad is…whatever he is. 

I am so sorry for this wall of text, big thanks if you made it through. Dear Reddit, how do I move forward?"
relationship_advice,I (37M) need help in how to break things off with a single mom (36F),"We've dated for about 3 years - seeing each other about once a week. She's the only person with kids I've ever dated.  She now has the kids full-time, which means any time she's not at work she has the kids.  Her birthday is in 10 days.

For several reasons I want to break this off. I started thinking this wasn't working at Thanksgiving but can never find time to talk and there's always one more thing (birthdays, Christmas, New Years, sister's in town, etc etc).

Should I wait until after her birthday?  If not, how do you talk to someone when you can't be alone with them? Just call? She has a 9 and 12 yo, how do I handle them since I've become closer with them?

tldr: How do you break up with a single mom and her almost teen kids when you can't get time alone."
relationship_advice,"I (29M) am back together (27F) with my ""poop socks"" girlfriend and I'm wanting to propose.","Like the title says and whether people like it or not, we are back together.

1. She knows I'm going to propose. I just don't know how yet. 
2. The sock thing is still an issue but I love her, so who am I to say what's right and wrong.

Things settled down and we got back in touch through a mutual friend. She was reluctant to see me because she was still mad and embarrassed. I sat on everything for a long time but couldn't shake how I felt about her. I worked really hard to try and look past the sock stuff and eventually broke down one night. When I saw her next I told her in the end I didn't care about her bathroom choices, but that I did care about her. She was still reluctant and kept me at a distance for several weeks but finally started getting closer to me. When I suspected things could get serious again I did have a long talk with her. I wanted her to know I respected her privacy and her choices but if we were going to make this work she needed to respect my belongings. She agreed and finally apologized. 

We're now to a point in our relationship where we've been talking marriage. She wants a nice wedding and so do I. The only problem we can see is that her sister refuses to want to have anything to do with me. This is a problem because she and her sister are really close and she doesn't want there to be any conflict. Her sister has refused multiple times to come over for dinner or even just agree to meet me so I can explain to her what's changed.  So I'm back on Reddit asking for advice since everyone helped me the first time. 

How can we solve this?"

relationship_advice,I feel like my religious Muslim friend is too controlling of me (atheist/fake-Muslim),"I think my friend is too controlling but I don’t know what to do

My friend comes from a strict Muslim family. My family is Muslim, but we are a lot more lenient. I dress modest usually, sometimes I show my legs though.   I don’t eat pork, yet I don’t pray. Anyway she’s just a lot stricter than I am and she actually believes in God. I’m just an atheist from a Muslim household. 

I feel like she judges me a lot unintentionally. One time I wore a crop top and she kept commenting on it making me uncomfortable. She apologized when I responded weird, but she just kept doing it. She kept asking me if I was mad and I said no. This is a common occurrence, she will always ask me if I’m mad. 

This white guy is interested in dating me rn. I don’t know him too well, but I’m starting to trust him the more I talk to him. He goes to a Christian private school. Which I thought could be a problem. When my friend found out she told me “so no. No no no” in response to me going out with him. That was a response I expected from her. I think it’s inappropriate among the other things that come out. I feel like if I was a white girl she wouldn’t say stuff like this. 

I feel like I come from an awkward space. I’m not religious at all, but I do follow some Muslim rules just to please my parents. I want to give the guy a chance because he is really nice and open with me. I just don’t know how to deal with her if I do? Or just in general how to tell her to back off?"
relationship_advice,My [27F] boyfriend [32] of two years watches rape porn.,"About a week ago we were driving and I asked to use his phone to look up directions because mine had died. I opened the search tab and when I did I saw his search history and there was searches for ""rapetube"" ""rape porn."" I didn't say anything about it and quickly searched what I first intended to do then gave it back. Fast foward a couple of days and I got into his phone while he was sleeping. I started looking through his history again, found more searches like ""forced blowjobs""  ""rape fantasy porn"" ""gag the bitch"" and then looked at the sites he looked at and they were pretty fucked up. I mean I've had fantasies of being forced not this extreme and I never woulda thought he'd have them. He's not a violent or even angry guy and since I've know him I've never seen any red flags. It was kind of jolting and I'm wondering if any of you have experienced this and if it's a cause to be alarmed. Should i bring it up to him or no? I don't want to leave him but I'm a bit concerned about this. Is this common?"
relationship_advice,My (18) girlfriend (18) of 2 years told me she was going on a college trip just to hang out with another guy,"Me and my girlfriend, whom I’ve been dating for a little over 2 years, have had a wonderful relationship. We’ve dated all through high school and have had a few problems here and there, but other than that I’ve had no problems with her and she has been very loving towards me. 

As our senior year is winding down, we’ve both talked about our future and how we can make things work after high school. I love this girl with all my heart and I want her to make the right decision for her future. A few months ago she told me she had a college visit that her and her mom were going to attend. The college, only being about an hour away from where we currently live, is smaller but was the only college in our area that offered classes she was interested in. I fully supported it at the time and even offered to come with her so we could both check things out, considering I would possibly be spending time with her on that campus, but she was very set on me not going with her so she and her mom could “spend time together.” I thought that was fair enough and didn’t really talk much about it afterwards. 

A few weeks later she goes on her college visit. She didn’t really text me much throughout the day, but she was on a visit and I didn’t expect her to talk to me much. She left around 11 AM and returned home at around  9 PM. I was surprised the visit took that long, but I assumed she and her mom went to eat out afterwards or stop by the mall on the way back. I asked her how it went, and her answers were pretty vague. I asked her how she liked the dorms and the campus, and she said she liked it. I was happy for her and brought up the possibility of us visiting the college again sometime in the future, but right after I said that she told me she wasn’t sure if she liked it anymore. That seemed really weird to me because she had always wanted to attended this college and talked about it for years. 

Now this is where it gets interesting. A friend of mine at school was also going to attend this college. A few weeks after “The Visit” me and my friend had a conversation about our plans after high school and he mentioned the college to me. I told him about how my girlfriend went to a visit/tour two weeks ago and he replied with “They didn’t have and tours 2 weeks ago, look it up on their website.” And that’s what I did. I went to their website and sure enough there wasn’t any date listed under the day she went. 

After school that day, I brought it up to her and she looked pale. She started stuttering and said “Oh well it must be an error on the website” I started asking her for more specific details about the college and she didn’t have any answers. She was visibly upset and started getting frustrated with me, saying things like “You always try to know where I am.” (Which is 100% not true). Shortly after our conversation, I texted her mom about the visit and her mom said she didn’t know what I was talking. I called my girlfriend a few minutes after and told her to come over to my place. 

When she arrived, I told her how I knew she lied to me about the visit and she just started bawling her eyes out. I asked her what was wrong and she said “I cheated on you.” I was stunned and started getting upset. I asked her for all the details and she told me some run down story about her going out to a guys house who lived near the campus. She said they only kissed but I still don’t believe she could be gone for almost 12 hours and only kiss. She had been texting him for months without me knowing. I haven’t talked to her since, although it only happened a few hours ago. 

So my questions are, what do I do? How do I talk to her about it? We’ve never had any issues so I’m lost with all of this."

Three years ago, my (36M) 10 years relationship with my girlfriend at the time ended, I discovered that she was sleeping with a guy for the last 4 years of our relationship, he was living out of town, and she would say she was on a business trip to go see him...I felt absolutely devasted, and fell into a deep depression. When I confronted her, she was not even sorry, and within 2 weeks, she got all her belongings, and left to go live with him....that was 2 years ago

Fo the following 2 years, I was put on anti depression medication, lost my job because my performance fell off a cliff, and had to be bailed out by my younger brother to pay the rent as my savings had melted. Thankfully, I slowly recovered, and although I lost a lot of time, I started working again, and today I am in a much better place

Five months ago, I was recontacted by my ex...She wanted us to meet again and speak, she said she was sorry for everything I went through and that she wanted to make things right, I accepted to meet her...I learned that she married a new guy, not the one she was screwing behind my back. I also learned she had a 1 yo kid with him. She said that she changed, and basically, she wanted to know if I still held any grudges against her...I hugged her and I said no, that I wished her all the best

For weeks following our rendez vous, I started pursuing her, and to my surprise, she was very responsive...We met again and again, and then we slept together again and again and again

Last week, I sent screenshots of our conversations that contained some very lewd messages, to her husband including some suggestive videos...I learned lately through a common acquaintance that her husband was filing for divorce

I feel both happy for getting my revenge, and I also feel like a piece of shit for breaking up a marriage and hurting a man I never met...but I mostly feel awful and feel like I had to vent somewhere"
relationship_advice,"Broke girlfriend's (23F) trust, things have changed, unsure how to fix..."," 

# 

My (23M) girlfriend (23F) and I have been together for almost 6 months. She's a special kind of girl, popular, attractive and intelligent. But she's had her fair share of negative relationships, most of which she ended up hurt and betrayed (with cheating and abuse in her past).

We were from very different worlds and have very different views in life. For example, her world was one where cheating and alcohol and such were very common in her friend groups, while i was from more of a conservative background who never had much exposure to those things. There had been many times we fought over things we couldnt relate to each other, but ultimately that difference in our worlds made our relationship work because she felt that she could trust me despite her trust issues, as i was from a ""different world"".

However, she was a very secretive person because she was ashamed of her past, and asked for me to keep our relationship details a secret. I promised her that.

I was also very close friends with my ex-girlfriend (broke up over 2 years ago) and are purely platonic. However, my current girlfriend, with her trust issues was very insecure about my relationship with her.

A couple of times when my current girlfriend and i took a break, I felt devastated and relied on my ex-girlfriend for comfort (purely platonically), and thus told her pretty much everything about my current relationship, breaking my promise.

A few days ago, my current girlfriend went through my phone and saw these texts to her, and found out she knows everything about our relationship, and got upset. She wanted to end things immediately but i convinced her to stay, and try and work things out with me. I explained to her why I did that and I was only trying to cope with the heartbreak that came along with possibly losing her.

Since then, I've agreed to cut things off completely with my ex-girlfriend and we haven't talked since.

Ultimately she agreed to work things out with me, but now, she just told me that she felt she couldn't trust me anymore, and being with her made her feel sad and fearful, instead of happy, which was how I used to make her feel. She says shes trying to make this work but she just feels so miserable when she's with me.

I'm at a loss of what to do.. Is it really time for me to let this special girl go? Have I really hurt her so much she can never see me the same way again?

I love this girl so much, and would be willing to put in effort to fix things, but if she's really miserable with me, is there no way to fix things? Is breaking up the only way to go?"
relationship_advice,Crazy Ex and her family trying to get back in my life.,"So this is a long story so I'll put a TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

So back in my Junior year of high school I started dating my ex and at the time she seemed fine, a little clingy but only really when we were together and honestly I thought things were great for quite a while. I met her parents after 2 months and we started having sex 3 months in,her parents approval was super important to her. Her parents were super nice and sweet and I was getting invited over all the time for family events, holidays things like that and it really helped as my parents refused to let me have a gf over.

&amp;#x200B;

So during my senior year (2008) I made a decision on what college to go to. It was out of state but only about 5 hours away. After I told her she was obviously sad for a few weeks but I told her how we would stay together, talk all the time, I'd drive back to see her every chance I had and that seemed to cheer her up. So graduation comes and goes and we're in the last few days before I head out to college, my GF asks me to come over and spend that whole Saturday, and Saturday night with her, and of course I do. We spend all day together talking , kissing even spending time with her family and everything seems good, so when it gets late she and I go to her room and go to sleep.  Now I am an insanely heavy sleeper to the point where if I'm not ready to wake up it takes a miracle to wake me up. So I get woken up when I feel this pressure on my lap and I notice that my GF is having sex with me while I'm asleep, in my head not a huge deal at that moment, so I figure I'll reach up and place my hands on her hips. This is when I realize that my hands and legs are tied up. Now to get past the part that is still hard for me to thin about my GF and her parents took turns raping me without protection.

I went of to college that Monday and just this past year came back home for the first, had my parents come out to visit me during college and after I graduated and moved to work to avoid running into them. This was something that I had only ever spoken about to a therapist before but she retired 2 years ago. The big thing she had always pushed was for me to go back home, saying that as long as I avoided it I was never truly over what happened. So I took a job near home and moved 45 minutes away and have gone back to see my parents, visit my high school plenty of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was good until I bumped into my ex last night. I tried to keep it together doing the usual small talk, she claimed she had been through therapy since and how sorry she was and then this little girl (I'd say she looked to be about 11)walks up to her and she turns to me and says ""I'd like you to meet your daughter"". So that is what I need advice on because she now is pushing me to be more involved with her and her family for our daughter, and I don't know what to do. On one hand if she is my daughter I want to be inher life I know nothing that happened was her fault, at the same time though I'm not sure I can be around them at this point and have no idea what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 12 years ago my ex and her parents raped me and now she wants me to be with them for the daughter I never knew about."
relationship_advice,Me (22F) got my boyfriend (26M) a Nintendo Switch for his birthday and he ‘soyfaced’. Now I want to break up with him.,"Hello Reddit, over the past few months I’ve been seeing chad/virgin memes and finding them pretty funny, particularly the ‘soyfacing’ ones. I never expected my boyfriend to be the type of man to do the ‘soyface’ thing but the other week when I bought him his Switch (something he’d always been asking for) he did exactly that. He’s always been into video games, and I’ve always been supportive of his hobbies, but this revolted me. It took me a long time to save up for the Switch, I work a minimum wage job at Target so when this happened I was honestly more disgusted than I should have been and I now feel like I’ve wasted my money and a significant part of my life (we have been dating for almost 4 years). I honestly can’t look at him the same as I used to. I've always thought he was a great guy even if he can be a little odd sometimes, and that was what initially made me attracted to him, but this has crossed the line in my opinion. I really don’t know what to do. I want to break up with him now, but I don’t know how to bring it up, or what reason to use to break up with him if I do it. My girlfriends agree with me that I should break up with him, but I’m still really on the fence. Part of me feels like I'm being awful, but I'm really not sure. What should I do?"

I get that i can be mean and angry sometimes but i just burst out of no where and feel like i can’t control it. i just feel betrayed even after i let her live with me and my family for a year. I want her in my life so badly but if she can’t respect my feelings at all i can’t do anything about it. It feels like she doesn’t even care. I just feel so lost and the idea of being with friends or anything makes me sick to my stomach and i just want to break down non-stop. I told her if she did it again i wouldn’t be able to be with her and that’s when she left her phone at home on purpose and the only reason i found out was because her mom came to my house looking for her. that’s so fucked up right? that just breaks my heart so badly. and to add insult to injury i have to go to jury duty soon and then valentine’s day comes up."
relationship_advice,My gf [25] spends too much money and I [30M] dumped her,"I [30M] dumped my gf this week.  Been dating almost two years. I am tired of her financially wreckless behavior.

In the last month she spent $500 on a designer belt, $1200 on a single pair of shoes, and $1500 on a teacup puppy.   She of course has multiple LV purses.

relationship_advice,"I [21M] have vitiligo, what goes through your minds when you see or try to approach a guy with vitiligo on his face?","I've decided today that I need to start actually asking women out on a more persevering basis. Because of my vitiligo all over my face and body I never had the confidence to do this in the past. I've just always found it hard to break through that whole dating circuit thing.

I know you are horrified by being approached in public by a stranger and you don't approach strangers neither. Having to make the first move it is like putting yourself in front of a panel for someone to say yay or nay, over and over. All they do is decide if you are good enough for them.

Anyway, one of the main barriers I find to asking someone out is that I'm more afraid that the askee will say ""Yes"" instead of saying ""No"" and that this ""Yes"" will be said out of pity more than anything else, I know I'm tired of the it makes you unique talk.

I've experienced this a few times before, where I'll ask an acquaintance on a date and she sort of winces and says ""Sure"". Then, either she ends up flaking out or I do because I can take a hint. I don't really want to go through a bunch of those again.

I have tried online dating and it is absolutely barren trying to find someone who will match with you and keep a conversation going. It can totally wrecked myself-esteem.

If you said being starved of any kind of positive attention for months or even years on end, then you're correct. Imagine all those compliments and attention you received over your lifespan. Now imagine none if it ever occurred. You now live a life of zero to next to nothing external validation, outward approval, or confirmation of any parts of your life."

How do i deal with that regret?"
relationship_advice,Pattern of disrespect and lying by partner (34M)," Hey all, I'm (34F) going to try to make this as concise as possible while still painting a full picture.  
I have been with my partner for 5 years. We have a 3 year old, and the pregnancy was planned. We are not married, and have recently purchased a home together.  
I've had ongoing trust issues due to a variety of factors. I'll try to capture them below.  
While I was pregnant, I noticed his spam folder in his email was overflowing with emails about sex chatting, hooking up, etc. He said he has no idea why he started getting those, and thought maybe it was from being on dating sites or visiting porn sites, but I've been on both and haven't ever got emails like this.  
When our daughter as a year old, a found an explicit photo, dated from the time I was pregnant. When I asked him, he first said it was from years ago. I said there was a date, and then he said it was from an old ex who sent them unsolicited and he then blocked her. However, I had remembered seeing her name pop up on my Facebook account's search bar, as he must have looked her up when day, so I messaged her and asked. She said he had told her that we were split up, and that the pictures were definitely not unsolicited. She did say that he eventually said, after our daughter was born, that we were going to 'work it out' and they hadn't communicated since. When confronted this issue, he apologized, and asked what he needed to do to fix it. He agreed to have transparency and access to his phone if need be. He said he lied because he didn't want it to mess things up, but it totally destroyed my trust.  
Fast forward to a year later. We moved closer to his hometown, and he began hanging out with old friends. I began seeing messages to certain friends that were extremely upsetting. He talked about being at a bar and chatting up a hot waitress, who he learned was only 18, which he thought sucked, 'unless he's F\*\*king one, then it's awesome"" and about how maybe he could ""convince me to have a threesome. There were texts talking about a new potential co-worker, who was very good looking, and how it's a ""good thing he looks homeless most of the time and doesn't have to be in the office all day"" and how he's not going to tell me about it because I'd ""just be worried all day haha"" There were lots of other texts like this. Commenting on women's looks, their 'fu\*\*ability' including friends of ours, etc.  
Finally, just two months ago, I saw he had been texting an old friend that he used to work with. I'd never heard him talk about her before, and so there was no indication that they were ever close. He said it was all friendly talk, but when I asked to see the messages, he had deleted them. He said he deleted them because he thought, given the past, it would worry me, even though it was just friendly talk.  
His response to all of this is that it is 'just idle talk' and that he would never do anything physical. He comes home after work, is very involved with our daughter, is hardworking, etc. I don't think there's anything else that's happened, but all of this has really affected my trust and self-esteem to the point that I don't think I can continue the relationship. I just feel terrible for our daughter's sake. What do you all think. Is this salvageable? Are his actions just a normal outlet and not indicative of something larger/guy talk? What's the best way to proceed from here, if not, that will be best for our daughter? We won't be able to sell the house until, at the earliest, the end of this summer because we are doing renovations on it. Not sure if I should start looking for a temporary living situation until the house gets sold and I can get into something better, or just stay and stick it out for now. Thanks for reading this long post. Happy to clarify anything or provide more details."
relationship_advice,I (32M) am divorcing my (30F) wife and trying to figure out how to deal with a new relationship.,"So I need to add some back story on this obviously. I've been married for about 10 years now. There were a lot of problems and the romance has been kind of gone for a while, but nothing that caused me and my spouse to dislike each other. About 4 years ago she decided she wanted to travel for long periods. She did this by taking ESL jobs and teaching English overseas. She would go on 6 month to 1 year trips doing this. I had been fine being supportive of her dreams. I had to stay for my job and we had a house/pets/i didn't want to leave all my friends either. We kept in touch online the whole time but obviously there's a lot of distance issues. 

However, a bit over a year ago we decided for the best of both of us we should think about divorcing (no kids or anything). We mostly agreed and decided to see how things felt when she got back from her latest trip. When she got back we felt the same,slept in separate bedrooms, but kept perfectly friendly. However, she wasn't back long enough to actually get the divorce finished, leaving me in a weird marriage limbo for a while.

So in the end of that, the tldr is we've really just been good friends for the last 3-4 years. 

Now fast forward to the last couple months, my friends convinced me to stop waiting around and just make a tinder since my wife won't be back until April (We had already discussed things and are fine with each other dating) . I figured I'd be honest up front, and getting into the 30s age bracket it I'd meet people who would might be understanding. 

So I ended up on a date with a girl that I'm getting along with good. She didn't immediately run away when I told her my situation. I'm getting everything setup to where we will have the paperwork in and be able to get the separation really soon after my wife is back. 

However, she'll be back for 2 months before she leaves again, and a good amount of time staying in the house. It makes the girl I'm seeing a little uneasy. She is unsure how she feels about us staying good friends, talking a bunch still, or any like close friend kind of things. I think partly she is worried we will like rekindle something, which I don't at all see happening. 

I'm trying to see it from her point of view, and I do. It's odd definitely and makes it more difficult that we don't hate each other or something. Living together and all that. But then when I go in my own shoes I just see a close friend who I don't exactly want out of my life but am in no way still in love with at all. 

I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle the situation. How other people would feel in the same situation. I don't want to throw ten years totally out the door. But I always really like where my new relationship is heading

Tldr divorcing a relationship where we don't hate each other and girlfriend is uneasy about us staying close."
relationship_advice,Attracted to one girls personality but not sure if I find her body attractive. Read on for the question please.,"So there’s this girl that I find very comfortable spending time with and she’s got tons in common with me. She looks kinda cute but not the hottest girl around. 

I want to ask her out but I’m thinking about her as well. In the sense that if I’m not sure I think she’s sexy looks wise, then maybe I shouldn’t ask her out. But I’m confused. 

I’m someone who likes girls with bodies like @anacheri and the like. This girls nothing like it. Not even close. But I get along very well with her so I want to give it a shot but I feel like I’m gonna waste her time if I can’t eventually love her body. 

I’m someone who’s average looking but I’ve dated much hotter girls in the past and I don’t know if I can be with a girl who doesn’t look like some model. It’s just how my brain has always been like. I don’t know how but it’s just it. I feel like I’m a bad guy for thinking that way and by no means do I judge women on that basis. 

I love hanging out with this girl and I’m very nice to her and I’m tempted to ask her out. But I just think I may not be ready to settle down with someone before waiting long enough to see if I can ever meet some one else who’s both super hot and gets along well with me. 

1. How do I fall in love with less hotter women?
2. What if I eventually find someone better than her for me? Then I’ll have regretted going out with her. 
3. How do I know if this is the girl?

Before anyone starts throwing accusations about me being an ass to women and all, you should know that I’m not, and besides there are plenty of women who very obviously keep judging me based on my appearance. I get treated differently when it’s just me VS when it’s me with a hot girl next to me. So there are judgemental asses everywhere but that’s a whole other issue on its own. 

Any help on my issue would be much appreciated thank you! 🙏🏼"
relationship_advice,I think my gf doesn't care about what I think,"Me and my gf have been in a relationship for about 8 months now and we have been fighting alot lately 
It was her bday recently and I messaged her telling I can't come to tuition (how we met and we're still teens) due to an unexpected situation. I told her about it and how I felt bad that I couldn't come. But she got mad and told me to go die (for the first time) and she wouldn't even listen to me on why I couldn't come
We fought alot and she even decided to leave (due to fighting) and I just went silent. But eventually I calmed her down and solved the fight.
Now recently we had a fight and this time it was because of her sending pvt info about us to random strangers online
She gave me her insta account and told me to keep it as she doesn't want any secrets btw us and I also agreed and gave her mine
Alot of guys message her and she would reply to them I was kinda bumbed but was ok with it as long as she doesn't share everything like pvt info about us to random people and agreed 
I just found out that she did exactly that and we had a fight about it
I was more more mad at the fact she did something that she agreed not to do so I felt she don't care what I think. This was not the first time this happen so I told her about it 
She said then she will not agree to what I say anymore so problem is solved 
I told her do what you want and left 

What should I do?"
relationship_advice,i (18M) don't know how to be upfront with my girlfriend (18F) (LDR),"so my girlfriend and i are very much happily in love, we've been together over a year. we're very open with each other and have great communication. but there's been some tension when i bring up her moving out to live with me (i live in a different state).  i suggest to her maybe during my second year of college (during the fall of 2020) which will give us a lot of time to prepare. she says she can't because she has to work to move. i don't understand because she has a job, she's getting college all paid for, and we'll be splitting everything. i would understand if she said early 2021, like yeah i get that. but then she says in 2 years (after 2022). i don't understand why we she needs to wait so long? like it's really not that difficult to move away and be financially stable with me paying half, her having parents willing to pay for college and bought her a car. am i just not understanding that saving up takes longer than that? ive had many jobs and saving was never an issue. i'd have over 5k from a 13$ dollar paying job saved up. i'm not sure what to do. ive tried telling her that i'm willing to help even tho i have so many things to pay for this year and next year (i am trans and am planning surgeries). but she insists she needs to save up money. but it's not like i live in los angeles. apartments where i live are like 1000 a month. can someone help me understand? am i just fucking dumb lmao"
relationship_advice,I (20f) am frustrated with myself in school and my bf (20m) said we can't be together if I don't improve,"Sorry for the formatting, I'm in mobile, also I know how the title sounds. Bad. It's not. To start out, I'm bad at school, I've always been mediocre at best when it comes to it. I did bad in highschool but not bad enough to not graduate, and in fact I can be pretty good at it. But that was highschool and now I'm in University and I'm still struggling. I failed a lot of my first year (only passed 3 of my courses) and I retook most of it in my second year. I had to drop one of my courses this year because I just can't do exams. I know the course, but I still manage to just fail the exams. 

Its become an issue in my relationship. My boyfriend noticed that I was trying harder this year, but I still manage to only get C's. I only dropped one course this year and it's coming to a realization that I might have to drop another course as I didn't do very good in the first half of it. I'm at a loss. He's finishing school in a few more years and here I am restarting my first year and still doing bad. He said that if I can't fix this, it might not be possible for us to be together in the future. 

I do have goals. I want to be a therapist. But for some reason I am struggling in psych the most. I've taken it twice and had to drop it. So I'm taking it a third time when I can. I know the course but I just can't do the exams and I don't know why. It is putting a strain on us and I love this man with my heart and soul and I really want to better myself with school for him. 

I guess what I'm asking is, how do I fix this? How do I get my shit together? Has anyone else been through this and had a positive outcome? Any advice would be very appreciated."
relationship_advice,I(17M) don't know how to proceed with my crush(16F),"I have had my eyes on a girl, who's one class lower than me, for about 2 to 3 months now. I finally decided to send her a message where I said that I think she looks pretty and I would like to get to know her better. She said sure. I went over to talk to her at school and it went pretty well. I walked up to her, she turned to me, smiled and said hi. I was really nervous and felt like my legs couldn't hold me up for longer. I sat down and said hi. We started talking about the usual, what do you do in your free time, family, school, etc. and I got much more comfortable in a few minutes. We talked in total for about 10-15 minutes. We noticed that the next class was starting and we said bye and went our separate ways. After that, we haven't spoken at all. We exchanged some smiles but nothing more. I don't know if I should go talk to her or does she even want to talk to me. If I were to go talk to her, how would I start? What do I say? I am really bad at starting conversations."
relationship_advice,"Is it just her opinion, but is my decision a dick move?","Okay, so as some backstory, my girlfriend and I have been dating slightly over two years now, her being 17, me being 16. Her dad has recently lost his job here in Oklahoma, and the only place he could find a new job in his field is in Colorado and has put the current house up for sale. They’ll be moving in June of this year. Upon hearing about the move, I took a few days to decide the best course of action. I came to the conclusion that it would be best if my girlfriend and I parted. She however didn’t like that at all, and has for the last few days, been constantly messaging me and getting her friends to hang up on me in order to take her back.  Her apparent reasoning for this is that I should have dated her through high school and then move after I graduate. Long story short, have I made the right decision in breaking up with her?"
relationship_advice,Should I forego a financial opportunity to keep my brother happy?,"I (M30) have had a pretty fortunate upbringing, financially speaking. When I was 18, my parents (through their company) bought a 1 bedroom apartment that I have been living in ever since. My GF moved in with me about 3 years ago. She's still in University, I'm working full-time.

Now that my dad is nearing retirement, he wants to sell the apartment for money to live for (my mom passed away 3 years ago). This has been the plan all along, but after talking to my accountant (who has been my family's accountant for years) advised me, that financially it makes sense for me (and my GF) to take out a loan, buy the house from my dad at well below market rate (totally legal in my country) in live in it until my GF want to settle down and buy our own house (in 3-5 years probably).

When all is said and done, my dad will get the exact same amount of money out of it, as if he sold it to a complete stranger. My gf and I, though, will get the surplus when selling (if prices obviously are higher at that time) tax free (again, laws), meaning we'll have a huge head start when buying a house. My dad's totally cool with this idea.

My brother isn't. 

My parents bought an apartment for him to live in, when he was my age (he's a couple of years older than me). He moved in with his gf some years later, the apartment was sold to a 3. Party, and he obviously didn't come away with any money at that time (neither did my parents).

When proposing to him that I could buy the apartment I've been living in, he said it would seem a bit unfair, since he didn't have the same opportunity. We've also talked about buying it together, but I don't know the laws around that (it would be different, since he won't be living there), and I'm also not sure he is in the position to take out that kind of loan since he has his own house and mortgage to pay already.

I don't want to cause a split between my brother and I because of money, especially since our mom passed, family comes first. But I'm also not sure that he's in the right, and all things being equal, it would be dumb if we didn't take advantage of the situation financially speaking...

Sorry for the long text, but I'd like to hear some opinions if you've got one.. :)"
relationship_advice,I found an email from my boyfriend to a mutual female friend that seems romantic? My last relationship was very emotionally abusive so I think I may be overreacting. Thoughts?,"My boyfriend (58/m) and I (29/f) have a mutual female friend who does a lot of travelling. She is gone most of the winter and stays in contact with us separately through email. She recently sent an innocent email to him saying she would be on the west coast and if he had a work trip lined up he was more than welcome to come visit. She mentioned she would be hiking some trails on the rainy coast and that it would be like a free evian facial. 

He responded to her saying ""great to hear from you; sounds enticing -- esp walking the misty trails with you; will see what i can do; but when will i see you back home; we miss you"" 

I know he is not actually going to go on the trip (he's too busy) and I know I shouldnt have looked at their email exchange, but I have persistent anxiety issues from my last relationship and find myself constantly  looking for danger before it happens. When I saw this, I felt that it was romantic and that he should have just said ""Thanks, would love to, but I can't make it"" .... but I am always afraid I am reading too much into things and being irrational. 

I am wondering what others might think about his response? Is it innocent? Or inappropriate? 

Please be kind. I am not in a great headspace about this."
relationship_advice,"My (23F) friend (25M) made out with me while we were drunk and I don't know what to make of it, he's seeing someone?","Hi relationship advice, my mind has been running in circles with this for days so I'm hoping some outside perspective will help!

Me and this guy (L) have been friends for a few months, he was a friend of a friend (J) who I no longer associate with (but I befriended J's friend group a while ago and hang out with them occasionally - L is a part of this friend group.) I went out with this group of friends for one of their birthdays, we went out and got pretty drunk, and then just all chilled at the birthday friend's house for a while, eventually sleeping over there. 

I shared a bed with L, because I did not want to sleep in an armchair, and also because I was pretty drunk. L pretty much immediately began cuddling me (with consent), and I was happy enough with that. But throughout the night I could feel him wiggling against me, and for some reason I decided to tease back. Again, we were both drunk! And I am an idiot.

After a while we realised neither of us were going to end up actually sleeping, and he made the move to kiss me. It's probably worth bringing up here that I was in a very abusive relationship years ago which I suffer PTSD from, and have not had a romantic or sexual relationship since. And yes, I am in therapy for it. My trauma had been triggered just hours before by me breaking something and immediately panicking, there was a lot of crying, so of course at this point I was immensely vulnerable. L knew of the abuse, and he knew I was feeling like that, and about my weird feelings towards sex and intimacy of any kind. But I digress.

We made out a whole lot that night. In between random talks, a lot of which were on my sex life which was strange enough, and I didn't hate it! I actually really liked it. I'd never felt so cared for and I'd never been so close to someone in an actually intimate sense... that was nice.  But some of the things he said to me stood out. About it being a one time thing, because a girl he is seeing, while not serious rn (and him being poly anyway) is getting more serious, and to keep it a secret (despite later telling one of our mutual friends, who was very for it, and seemed to see it as him doing that as a favour to me to get me over my trauma). He's the type to flirt with everyone so that's even more confusing.

We haven't mentioned it since; we're still close enough (he also followed me on an nsfw account I made like as soon as I made it lmao) and I've not been making everything weird between us, but I'll admit there are some weird feelings there anyway. For starters there's that damned feeling that I like him, in that sense, which would make sense as I somewhat did before that happened - he's cute, funny, and we like a lot of the same things. I can kiss friends as friends, sure, but the amount of gassing me up (and also feeling me up, lol, he copped a whole lot of feels..) that went on that night felt way beyond that?? It seems like he thought he was doing a favour getting me over my trauma by showing me that sex and intimacy != bad, but without much thought of consequences. of course now I am very confused about everything, and I feel a bit taken advantage of as I was still drunk and vulnerable. I don't feel like I can talk to him about it as I completely believe his intentions weren't bad and it's probably my fault for making something so big out of something I shouldn't, but it was way more intimate than normal and I have no idea what I'm supposed to feel. I'm being so hard on myself for having literally any feelings towards him and the situation at all right now because I know I should have kept everything non serious and platonic, but at the same time I don't feel like I can really be blamed for that?? I'm really confused and could use some advice on how I should really be feeling about this and what I should even do now... it's obvious he likes this other girl and not me so I guess getting over it is one thing but how do I even do that when we did what we did??

Sorry this was so long winded, I'm just struggling a lot with this right now.

TL;DR my friend kissed me and nothing has been said since, I'm having a lot of feelings about it and I feel like I shouldn't but I also have no idea what to make of everything."
relationship_advice,Nighstands with Co worker (23M),"Hey y'all,

Not sure if this is the correct comm to post on but here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

New guy started working in the office not too long ago maybe 3 months ago. instantly I noticed how handsome he was but didn't pay too much mind to it. As we started to interact more in the work place started to get to know him more we came to find out we both like to chief the only ones in the office that do. (sshhhh).We started hanging outside of work to chief and chit chat. a physical attraction began to grow and I started crushing on him (vise versa) . we eventually exchanged numbers and started texting, he started sending sexual memes him hinting he wanted to go down on me etc. we both told each other were crushing on each other but weren't looking for anything serious ATM we decided to just be friends and get to know each other. Eventually he invited me over his place to hang. The first few times we just chilled nothing happened. One specific night he invited me over I agreed to go over determined to finally have some type of something with him I was ready to get some head...well the moment arrived were watching a movie laying on his bed we start cuddling I managed to take my bra and shirt off then he turned me on my stomach pulled my pants and panties down started caressing my butt and kissing it next thing you know he goes in...but not with his mouth or tongue :/.

&amp;#x200B;

He finishes in less than 2 Mins! we get dressed and go back to cuddling so nope didn't get any of what I was promised. fast forward to another occasion when I go over same things cuddling talking watching a movie one thing leads to another still no Oral action :( 2nd round of intercourse he finished again in 5 mins at least this time I got to ride him a little but yup nothing for me. I brought it up to him days later letting him know whats up. Like hey you know you been getting yours but what about mine? also you expressed here and there up and down how much you wanted to go down on me but still nothing. I even asked him if I stank or something? lol He said that next time It would be all me.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is should I give him another shot? Im contemplating if I should or not. Hes been asking me to go over but I just dont know if I should even continue to engage with him in sexual acts. I still am crushing on him Im still attracted to him we flirt at work but Idk if it'll be worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any opinions or advice?"
relationship_advice,Should I cut my losses and break up with my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend (31) and I (25) have been together for nearly four years and lived together for two and a half of those, although following a really rocky year we're now living apart again.

There's quite a lot to it, but to summarise as briefly as I can, the first couple of years were great. We loved each other a lot and really enjoyed being together. We were both independent and did plenty of stuff on our own, but I spent enough time with his group of friends to consider them mutual friends. We had a really good relationship and it was easy. 

But something changed within the last 18 months and I stopped feeling like I wanted to be intimate with my boyfriend. I think this was because I was feeling really down and awful all the time, and my hormones were all over the place. Then I was diagnosed with an incurable skin condition (which came out of nowhere but was probably triggered by stress/hormone changes) which manifests as looking like I've had an allergic reaction across my face, which can last for days at a time. This really really knocked my self confidence, and that coupled with feeling so down made me withdraw and I stopped going out because I always felt uncomfortable and anxious about my appearance.

My boyfriend was relatively supportive for the first few weeks of this ""new me"" making an appearance, and tried to understand how I was feeling, but he quickly got angry, sulky and withdrawn, especially as our sex life started to suffer. I tried many times to explain that it wasn't him, and that I was sorry and was trying to work through how I was feeling, but over the course of the year it got to the point where he stopped inviting me out with him and his friends and we were arguing all the time. I wasn't a Saint in this, as I was probably difficult to live with during this period as I was so down, and I understand that would have been hard for him to deal with. 

When he eventually made the decision to move out, things started to feel better between us and I asked him to start including me in things with him and his friends again like he used to do to try to rebuild the relationship. I acknowledged that I needed to try to work on my confidence and stop shutting myself away, and I needed his support with this. He said he would include me, but months passed and he never did, despite me asking him many many times. This made me feel like he was embarrassed and didn't want to be seen out with me. I spoke to him about this over and over, but he kept ""forgetting"" to invite me.

Around the end of last year I learned that one of his friends, and someone I considered a mutual friend (although that was obviously a bit naive) was having a party for the whole group. On one of our good days I told him I really wanted to come, and he said he wanted me to be there too. It felt like things were going to get better, and I think I kind of pinned all my hopes on this party. It was going to be so nice to see all these people that I now hadn't seen for over 12 months, and I'd stop feeling like he was keeping me hidden away and everything would go back to normal. I bought a new outfit and started getting really excited. 

Anyway, a few weeks passed and I realised one night that he still hadn't told me the exact date, so I text him and asked when it was happening. He told me it had been cancelled and that it wasn't going to happen anymore, which I thought was odd as it had seemed pretty certain. Something told me something wasn't right and I looked on one of his mates Instagram accounts, and there were pictures of them all at this persons party just a few days earlier. 

I asked him why he was lying to me and he immediately admitted it and went on to say that he forgot to tell me and only realised on the day that he hadnt invited me, by which point he thought it was too late and I'd be mad that he hadn't told me earlier. But that was another lie, as he'd been texting me most of the day of the party and the day before. To add insult to injury, he also next me the night that the party had happened telling me that he was really poorly and was in bed, and I'd replied sympathetically telling him I was sorry he wasn't feeling well. I felt like such an idiot. 

To be honest, as I read this back I kind of feel like that should've been the end of it, but he was so guilty and upset and apologetic afterwards that I told him we'd give it one last shot. He said he realised he'd made a mistake and wished all night that I was there with him. I told him he had to promise to involve me in things again, and that if he ever made me feel like he was embarrassed of my again, I would end the relationship. 

But he's just gone and done it again. He had a month not drinking, so hasn't been out and seen his friends since the party, and he told me last night that they're all going out this Saturday. But he hasn't invited me again. I wish he'd just invited me, I shouldn't have to keep begging to be included. 

He's now said he didn't invite me as he'd just be worried all night that I wasn't having a good time. 

I don't want to go out with him and his friends every time, it's so important to have your own space in relationships, but at this point - having not seen any of his friends for over a year when I used to see them pretty regularly - I don't even know if they know he still has a girlfriend. And that makes me feel like his horrible little secret. 

He's now saying he will include me, and that this time he just wanted to go out with just his friends as he hasn't seen them for a month. 

Is this cycle just going to keep repeating? It's making me feel so embarrassed, and he's telling me I'm acting crazy and out of order, which is making me doubt myself massively. Should I just cut ties now? 

He tells me he is in love with me and wants to be together forever, that he thinks we're soul mates and that he can't imagine life without me, but he isn't acting like he thinks any of those things (apart from when it's just the two of us when he's really overly affectionate). 

If things could just go back to how they were I'd be so happy, but I'm so miserable in this cycle of feeling crap all the time that I just feel like I want to end the relationship the moment. Am I kidding myself that things can ever go back to normal at this point? 


Sorry for the rant. I hope I didn't seem too mad (although I fear I did!) 

Any advice appreciated x"
relationship_advice,"Any advice? [Me] 23 M , girlfriend [18] doesnt like to be public about our relationship.",So I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now and I love her to death and want to be together forever. Problem is that I feel like she doesnt like being public about us over the internet. In person its different but online she barely ever mentions me or talks about us. I just cant shake thinking somethings always up when she says it's fine. Recently found out that she hid me from her gay friend because she thought her friend wouldnt stay her friend if she found out she was straight.... I just overthink about it somedays. Any advise? Thanks.
relationship_advice,Need some help overcoming insecurities,"My wife and I went through a low point in separated. She started playing a mobile game, and developed a very intimate relationship with an individual in the game. After my wife and I split it, it comes to my attention that she had been participating in an emotional and sexual relationship relationship with this man she met over this mobile game up until we split, and continued to do so afterwards.

Lots of conversations and time spent together, we were able to recognize the problems that were stemming between us, and. Changes were made so we could go back to living life as a happy family together. Her, myself, and our three old son. Things have been fantastic. Happier than ever before a tually,now that everything she felt the need to keep bottled up can now exist between us! I know it's hard to explain.

Except there have been problems caused by the one common denominator. Her game that she continues to play.

She ended the relationship with the individual that had been going in since before we split. She was supposed to cease all contact with him, as that would be the most desirable thing to do. Things pop up occasionally,and it gets out that she has spoken to him briefly about something,but that's besides the point.

She has left that game entirely to play a different one, and to find a new group of friends for a fresh start. All bad memories behind us. However she brings one of her old friends with her.this is a big problem to me, as  I wanted the past gone, she doesn't see why it is. 

My insecurities are driving me crazy. Hindsight has let me seen things that just didn't trigger a red flag when we split up. Stuff that she's doing again. Sleeping on top of her phone. Freaking out if I pick it up. Spending long amounts of time talking to people. Getting angry when I notice stuff and talk to her about it. I don't want to isolate her in any way, I just don't think it's a good idea to be around those same people. 

These red flags could just be my being hyperaware of seeing them due to my insecurity. I trust her. It's just so terrifying and every time I see her typing to someone, I can't help but wonder what if."
relationship_advice,Feeling distant,"I have been feeling distant from my partner of a year and a half. Multiple times I have tried to talk to him about it and he just says that he is stressed out/preoccupied. He also has said that we have entered a new phase of our relationship, exiting the honeymoon phase and that our relationship is still important but we aren’t constantly learning new things about each other or spending every second together. I realize that, but am I asking too much to still want to keep a little bit of the honey moon phase alive? We still have things we like to do with each other, still say I love you and joke around often. Something just feels off and I can’t explain it. He is constantly on his phone when we are alone together (I’m not worrying/don’t think he’s cheating) Every time I try to have a discussion about it, it feels like he’s not fully opening up and I want him to.

relationship_advice,I [25/M] feel lonely in my relationship with my gf [24/F],"Hi there, I would really appreciate if anyone can help me out with these thoughts I'm having. They are kinda making me feel pretty sad lately.

I've been working in a new city in a different country, and in October I went on a date. The date was amazing, and I &amp; my date never felt so comfortable &amp; great being with someone so quickly. We talked for 8 hours. We kept dating, and seeing each other probably 2 nights or days a week. This person is now my girlfriend/partner as of December.

I am now feeling kinda lonely in my relationship, and I always feel like I'm the one making plans or trying to see her. She works 40 hours a week, and also likes alone time. I totally respect, and understand this and want that for her. And for her to also hangout with her friends. However, I feel like she gives more of her energy to hanging out with her friends to me. Most times I hang out with her I get to her at about 10 PM at night since she'll go to work, then go to the gym, and then cook/shower at home. By the time I get there she will usually fall asleep within 30 minutes. I'm okay with this even honestly because I am just happy being next to her, but I don't feel satisfied.

This relationship is making me feel very needy, and maybe I am. But I think it's normal to want to see my SO more often? She told me she never makes plans because she hates to flake and feels differently everyday. With that she told me to not take it personally, and that's how she is with everyone.

I recently told her most of how I was feeling, and how I feel lonely. She said she feels a lot of pressure now from hearing that. I told her that all I want is to see her a bit more, and I will probably feel great. This might also be due to the fact that I'm in a new city, and I work from home. I'm not sure, but regardless I feel my relationship is contributing to this? I feel like I'm in a friends with benefits type situation without the freedom of being able to seek others company to not feel lonely.

Kinda unsure of what to do. I love her more than anything right now, and I can tell she loves me too. I should've also mentioned she's under high financial stress at the moment. Even taking transport to me is a pain for her budgeting at the moment. I get that, and offer to pay for anything. And I told her we can do stuff without spending. That I'm just happy to be with her. I don't know. If you read this, thank you for your time. I appreciate any words of advice.

tl;dr: I feel lonely in my relationship and want to see my gf more nights of the week/weekend."
relationship_advice,Does my husband have sexsomnia or is he having wet dreams and waking me up to satisfy himself?,"I just need to know if anyone has had any experience with this. My husband of 4 years started to wake me up on a regular basis in the middle of the night about a year ago. He hasn't gone with a sleep specialist but I am pretty positive he has sexsomnia. He doesn't seem interested in getting checked because I guess he thinks it's not a big deal even though he says he's never had it before. I think it could potentially be dangerous if this ever were to happen with someone else besides me. 

Here's the thing, we haven't been having sex much while awake. When he does it while sleeping he is way more passionate and aggressive so it makes me wonder if he's just having sex dreams and wakes me up to finish him off? Then he pretends he wasn't conscious to not hurt my feelings. This might be the reason why he doesn't want to find more about this condition. At first I found it funny but now I'm mad that he's waking me up and I can't go back to sleep and I'm tired the next day at work."
relationship_advice,Sexual addiction and how I should control our “fantasies”,"Hey everyone. To start, I dont know if this is more of a rant or more of a plea to see that I'm not the only one? Please note that as wild as my stories and experiences may be, they are 100% true. I am not just making stuff up out of thin air to get more sympathy or pity or attention. 

I have been a reddit member for about a couple months now but this is an alt account so please excuse the lack of karma. I am in my mid 20s and have never had a reddit account until recently. It wasnt until my time on reddit that I noticed that I didnt know myself at all. I guess my entire life I have been more of a ""do-er"" and not much of a thinker. Since being on reddit, what have I found out? I found out that I am insecure, both emotionally and within my own skin. Looking back at my life, I can see how my life experiences has made me insecure.

To start at the beginning, I was raised in a non-affectionate household. Kisses, hugs, and ""I love yous"" were not present. Family dinners together to recap our days? Non existent. My family had a family restaurant and well, I was ""working"" as young as elementary school helping out. The older I got, the more responsibilities i had to take on at the restaurant. Busy weekends got the best of my parents. Often they were yelling and screaming at each other, and the word  ""divorce"" was thrown around all the time. Thinking back in hindsight, my anxiety and insecurity from lack of physical and emotional love might stem from that. Fast forward to my early teen years, it was the great time of myspace and the little aol instant messenger chat. Oh, when we got internet, I discovered online porn and wow haha. Sadly, my personality is extremely addictive and well, lets say, atleast one a day, i use it as a stress reliver too. I started to go online and chat with anyone that would give me attention to try to fill that void. Friendly light hearted chats, deep conversations, and that lead to a couple relationships online as an early teen (I even ""dated"" a fine lady from France too and chatted with people all across the US). My one flaw I guess through this entire void filling process was that emotions always got involved. I was never able to just keep things NSA. I was not a cold void filling machine, but instead I was warm and just looking for people in the same situation or just anyone that would give attention. Throughout the years until I was 17, it was kept online since I had no way of meeting anyone or sneaking away. When I got my provisional drivers license at age 17, my parents bought me a car, and I was sneaking away to meet up with online friends. As a very frisky and high labido teenage boy, lets say one thing let to another and I had my first actual sexual experience at the ripe age of 17 and well, due to my again, addictive personality, i unfortunately became a sex addict. More and more, I was online looking for friends and FWB. I was a pretty good looking guy. My metabolism was great and I was a lean (so I thought) womanizing machine. 

I needed the experiences so bad that when I hit 18, I went on to expanding my criteria to women of all ages. I signed up for an Adult Friend Finder (AFF) account and within the first couple weeks, i matched with multiple couples in my area. They were the typical fantasy scenario you would hear of, 40s-50s couple seeking a younger guy to help pleasure his wife, etc etc. I met with a few couples and only continued with one couple. They were extremely kind and loving. They were into like light bondage and BDSM stuff so that was a first experience for me. I was a quick leaner so I quickly became great at it. They werent just a fling, but the husband taught me things like how to respect a lady, how to make her feel wanted, the more sensual stuff, how to dress and do my hair to meet a shared hotwife, how to create a little budget for finances, and it was create. At this point, they felt more like friends than just an activity partner. Sadly, the wife had a stroke and was not able to recover from it. The husband soon found another gf and invited me to partake but at this point, I was getting ready to go off to college. I was hurt at the same time that he just left his wife there after her stroke and he immediately found another. I went off to college and didnt hear from them again. 

I went off to college and wow, it was an experience. I never had soooo much freedom in my life. All of my life, my parents kept me locked up and caged and well, when I lived on campus, it was a freeing experience. I continued my online chats and my freshman year I was legit friending any cute girls that even attended the same school.  I also found out that one of the girls from my HS online chatting days also went to the same university. Now, distance was no obstacle so we had lots of fun activities. Again, the bad thing is, I was never able to keep things no strings attached (NSA). I am the worst friends with benefits ever. We would cuddle, I would feed you, we would hang out, and have all the feelings involved. It was to the point where my floormates started asking if we were a couple and I said no. A part of me was in denial and I kept pushing the mentality of ""she is my FWB/cuddle buddy"". She was a great girl but I started becoming cold. I liked her but it wasnt like LOVEEE. She was having trouble with her ex and we werent really meshing well after my mentality switched. I was a complete A hole out of what I attribute to be a self defense mechanism. hurt before you could get hurt right? I sucked. I matched with another girl on another app, there were spark everywhere, we started off as FWB, made a run to home base on the first day of seeing her. This lasted for a bit and well, I was catching feelings. she made her stance a few months in. She wanted a BF/future husband, not a FWB. Did I like her? Yes. We were pretty good for each other. We dated for a while, and long story short of across 7 years, we are now married. 

In the entire time I was with her, I have never cheated on her. but does ""Jill"" (my left hand count)? LOL. Jk. But yeah, its been awesome. I have slipped up and chatted with some old friends but nothing more. Every so often, we start to use the gif sections of reddit to explore what we like and dont like, things we want to try. Im great with my hands so whenever she would scroll past a MMF or FFM gif, I would go nuts. I guess its like conditioning her too right? She has noticed and we talked about opening things up a bit to a third to fullfill my fantasy. My wife, she is not one to engage first. Because of my libido, I am engaging 99.99% of the time. Our housing situation is a little sticky so we cant just invite people over. For me, I have been going on reddit so much to initially find a third (male or female) that its gone awray. I have found myself posting for attention, reaching out to hundreds of women a day to get a reply. I have even considered meeting up with a couple of them in real life too. I created an account to find more ""friends"" and deep friendly intentions, but because im so messed up, my flirtiness scares them away. I have an account to post NSFW pics of myself and get some feedback that way, but after chatting, the deep friendly part chases them away since they just want NSA. I havent been able to find a good balance of each. I scare off alot of people because im too open and direct? I legit dont have a filter. My latest insecurity is when redditors are trading pics, i have often gotten ghosted or dont reply to, especially when we are conversating and having a good time, and then poof right after me sending a pic. I get it that Asians are not all that well wanted to begin with and we are not everyone's cup of tea, but sheesh :( I have been called everything from hot to ugly. There is no consistency. So the anxiety and insecurity brought out by my reddit experience has been reflective. This morning, I decided that, what the heck am I thinking and doing? Yes. I am no longer the stud muffin I used to be. I have love handles and a childless ""dad bod"" now. I have to work on me first. The first step in that, was creating a new reddit account and just focus on those communities that promote healthy growth and wholesome vibes, confidence and just airing out my entire lifestory since everyone knows a little piece of it and never the whole thing. 

Anyways. Sorry for the rant and confession. Please comment or send DMs on what you think, if you are like me in any of my life's experiences, if you came out from it? If you have any harsh truths, please note, I am still anxious and insecure, so please dont put me on blast and comment with that, send a DM and we can work on it and chat about how I can better myself. I am taking this to reddit because I have found that reddit is truly an amazing group of people. The communities can be wholesome, loving and accepting, no matter what the circumstances. yes, you have those that will bash me, but please do it via DM. I love you all and if you made it this far in this story, thank you and I hope to hear from you. I am looking for friends still too. For those that read through my entire story, join me in my walk of being a better me :) 

Thank you.   XoXo DiaryofanComplexAsian"
relationship_advice,I’m [18F] and I can’t help but feel my boyfriend [18 M] would be better off without me and I don’t know that do about it,"**Disclaimer: I know I’m young and it might not seem like a big deal but please don’t ridicule me for it this is very real for me. Also sorry it’s so long 


I’m a college student within my first year of university and it’s truly the first time i’ve ever been alone and have had my own space. Throughout my early to mid teens I struggled with depression and just an overall lack of control within my own life and now that I don’t feel compelled to keep it together because I’m no longer near my family I’m falling apart. I have no friends here whatsoever because I really don’t know how to build relationships, I struggle with my own identity and not knowing who I am as a person, and I kept help but feel my parents kept me from living out my youth as most of the time I was expected to stay home studying and spending hours perfecting piano to get accepted into college. 

I met my boyfriend two years ago through my, now ex-boyfriend, and after my relationship ended with my ex this last May I started dating my boyfriend in July. My ex-boyfriend was quite honestly a piece of shit who cheated on me constantly, ignored my feelings, and never made an effort to see me but expected me to do so. He was my first love and he’s the only example of me disobeying my parents and pursuing something I wanted but of course over the course of two years things turned sour for me. Every time my ex would cheat on me or threaten to take his own life I would fall to pieces because I had to be the strong between us. That’s when my boyfriend would come in and put me back together I managed to fix everything with my ex. 

My relationship with my boyfriend is great. He loves me, he treats me well, and I feel comfortable around him, but the effects of my last relationship are still present and I think this is causing tension between us. Every time my ex would get mad he would take it out on me and I would just stop talking to him to avoid being hurt and that, along with many other examples, are things I do now that upset my boyfriend. I just can’t let these old habits go and I can’t help wonder if I should just leave him because he’d be better off without me. 

My boyfriend is ready for marriage. We’re very young and I’m not gonna lie I was the same way with my ex but I feel like he’s planning too far head and it triggers the feeling of being robbed of my youth once more. He make small critiques of my want to get tattoos or dye my hair because they’re fun and make me feel in control. Sometimes he sounds exactly like my father who doesn’t support these things either and in a way it causes fear within me even though I know he’s just trying to say he likes me the way that I am. 

To make matters worse I never really dealt with my breakup and I find myself longing for my ex. I feel extremely guilty because I do feel like I love my boyfriend but I just can’t help longing for my ex because again he was my first love. I know it’s completely irrational but I miss talking to him and being with him even though he treated me so poorly. A part of me thinks I just miss the big piece of myself I lost after being with him and putting all of myself on the line for him. 

I ask my boyfriend if he worries I won’t make him happy because I’m sad all the time but he says he doesn’t. He feels the needs to take on all my emotions and he refuses to let me handle them in my own even despite the fact that I’m seeing a counselor. I know it has to be taking a toll on him because I’ve been in that same position. 

I just really don’t know what to do. I love him but I don’t want to hurt him by being with him. I’m thinking of moving on from my counselor to an actual long-term therapist but that’s the only idea I have. Please if you have any advice I’d be happy to hear it."
relationship_advice,I got upset because my gf wants to wear revealing dresses,"Me(16M) and my gf(17F) of 1 year were recently talking about the prom next year, and she described some dresses which she likes and wants to choose from to wear at the prom. I found them to be way too revealing, and got pretty mad. She said that she can wear whatever she wants, to which I replied by telling her that I won't let her choose my outfit anymore, something she really wanted and to which I previously agreed. (Why let her choose my outfit when I don't have a say about hers). She got mad as well, and told me to ask for other opinions in order to see how wrong I am. I get mad at the idea of her wearing revealing clothes because I don't want others to see as much of her as I do or even more (seeing her in any of those dresses would be an all time record for me)."
relationship_advice,"My fiance is leaning towards a more plant-based diet because she struggles with a lot of meats textures. I have no problem with meat. However I do all the cooking, how do I accommodate her?","I don't even know if this is the right subreddit. To clarify we are both watching what we eat due to the upcoming wedding. She has a problem with chicken and shrimp textures. So I stopped cooking either, which is fine. Mostly our protein options now are tofu, chicken sausage, ground turkey(switched from ground beef for less calories). We both eat fish, but I usually make meals with 4 servings so we can reheat it the next day and eat it again, but fish doesn't reheat well.

However last night she said she's getting grossed out by ground turkey now, she said it looks like brains, which we both laughed about.  She said she would be fine with tofu every night and I asked what I'm supposed to eat then, and she said I can eat what I want. I then asked if she expected me to make 2 versions of every dinner then, and she didn't really have an answer. I do not know what to do about this now. Most of my dishes are quick 1 pan meals or sheet pan dishes so we can spend more time together rather than me cooking. I want to accommodate her but making 2 versions of every meal would be difficult. Last night was stirfry all in 1 pan.

So... help?"
relationship_advice,My (35M) girlfriend (28F) posted BDSM related texts from someone else to a secret IG while we're dating,"Thanks in advance!

The situation is a little less black and white than the title would suggest, struggled to summarize.  I'll attempt to do so and keep this short. 

Girlfriend and I have been together since August 2018.  We've been living together since early summer 2019. 

We are involved in a D/s relationship (not fully lifestyle, but close to it)  I am Dominant and she is submissive.  

Around February 2019, she told me she had a second IG account as a sort of kink journal.  She wouldn't let me have the username because she said it was sort of embarrassing/private, but did share some of the posts by reading them to me.  According to her, it was basically all about us as a couple.  

A short time after that, she then showed me a post, but failed to hide the username completely.  Not sure if it was a slip or if she simply didn't think I'd be quick enough to see it and read it.  Years of gaming made me ready!  

We've had some jealousy and loyalty issues, they're on me for the most part, some inappropriate messages to some friends.  Nothing explicit of any kind, just some light but obviously flirting.  She discovered this by looking through my phone.  We've been moved past it for some time though.  I'm not sure that this is relevant to my problem, but I wanted to include the history so that I could get a bit of a sanity check in case Im projecting onto her. 

Now, to the actual issue. 

Back in November, for no reason I can think of, I decided to google  her username from the site where we met.  And I came across a relatively new account on a pic/vid selling site.  We discussed, and I decided that I would let it go since, according to the site and her, she never sold anything. 

That got me a little on edge, because I remembered asking her where she was posting a pic while we were sitting next to eachother (it wasn't a nude but it was close) and she told me she had sent it to one of her female friends.  I had seen enough of the screen to know it was a lie, but I didn't know for certain until I saw the same pic there.   Anyway...

The posts on her ""secret"" IG journal.  When I found that account, I couldn't help myself and searched for her other IG to see what else I would find.  As she said, it was almost entirely directly related to her and I, and it was anonymous.   What I did notice, though, were two posts, screenshots of texts.  These were among the first things on the account (added in Dec 2018, along with posts that were definitely me/about me)

These two screenshots were not familiar to me.  I don't think I was the person she was talking to.  They used phrases I don't use and sort of actively don't like so I would never.  Nothing extremely identifying, but pretty clearly not me. 

I didn't think much of it, until about 2 days ago when she mentioned getting X number of likes on her post, which was on that account.  We got back around to the topic and she mentioned again that it was all stuff about me/us.  I asked a couple of times ""confirming"" the same without giving away that I was aware of the content.  She read a few posts from the December 2018 ""era"" but not the suspicious ones. 

Now today, because it was kind of bugging me, I went to re-read them and see if I could shake up some memory.  And they're gone.  She's removed those specific two posts.  That pretty well solidifies it to me that I wasn't just forgetting them. 

So, my questions... 

1.  Should I bother saying anything?  It's from over a year ago. 

2.  What's your gut telling you guys, reading it?  It's about 4 months after we got together.  Is this a case of enjoying the way those specific messages came across, or were these fresh and she was engaging with someone else in an intimate manner while we were together? 

3.  Would you be upset/upset enough to bring it up even if they were from an old relationship but she posted them anyway? 

4.  Do you think it's better or worse that she's removed them now?  As far as Im aware, she doesn't know I know the acct. 

I'm completely comfortable talking to her about it, and plan to, but I want a sanity check first.  There are a number of oddball things throughout the relationship that make me think this is not super innocent.  I can provide more detail, but to give an example, taking pics/nudes ""for herself"" or to send to me later.  I've discovered those by seeing the album while she shows me other pics. 

Happy to answer with whatever details I can provide further."
relationship_advice,"every time by boyfriend (M23) and I are cuddling after sex he pushes me (F23) off the bed and yells ""CLOTHES TIME!!!""","so my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year. its great- he's super sweet and we get along really well. I haven't really told anybody about this because I didn't think it was a big deal but the other night it escalated. we were lying together after sex and we were cuddling and everything was great. I reached down to caress him, and suddenly he pushed me off of the bed and onto the floor, where I lay, naked, feeling very surprised. he yells ""CLOTHES TIME"" and scampers off into the bathroom and hurriedly put on clothes. I was very confused at this point, and wondering what was going on. I put on clothes and then he left like everything was totally normal. 

I'm just feeling confused, is this normal?"

relationship_advice,Me and my partner seem to not talk so much anymore.,Lately me and my partner have seem to grow more distant and we don't talk that much or meet so often. We have been together about a year now. How do iniatiate talk and what should I say to her? I love her very much and I don't want to lose her but if she wants so I am willing to break up with her.
relationship_advice,Give me some perspective (21M),"I've decided today that I need to start actually asking women out on a more persevering basis. Because of my vitiligo all over my face and body I never had the confidence to do this in the past. I've just always found it hard to break through that whole dating circuit thing.

I know you are horrified by being approached in public by a stranger and you don't approach strangers neither. Having to make the first move it is like putting yourself in front of a panel for someone to say yay or nay, over and over. All they do is decide if you are good enough for them.

Anyway, one of the main barriers I find to asking someone out is that I'm more afraid that the askee will say ""Yes"" instead of saying ""No"" and that this ""Yes"" will be said out of pity more than anything else, I know I'm tired of the it makes you unique talk.

I've experienced this a few times before, where I'll ask an acquaintance on a date and she sort of winces and says ""Sure"". Then, either she ends up flaking out or I do because I can take a hint. I don't really want to go through a bunch of those again.

I have tried online dating and it is absolutely barren trying to find someone who will match with you and keep a conversation going. It can totally wrecked myself-esteem.

If you said being starved of any kind of positive attention for months or even years on end, then you're correct. Imagine all those compliments and attention you received over your lifespan. Now imagine none if it ever occurred. You now live a life of zero to next to nothing external validation, outward approval, or confirmation of any parts of your life."

relationship_advice,Help me navigate this workplace from hell,"Using an alternate account for several reasons.

I [30M] am an attorney 2.5 years out of law school. I did well at a good school, and I like to consider myself a capable, moral attorney with quite a bit of ambition. When I graduated from law school, I took a job at a small reputable litigation firm I continue to work for today. This firm has turned into literal hell on earth, and I need some advice.

I became the third attorney when I joined the firm. The firm was founded by Jack [45M], about 12 years ago. Jack remains the owner and principal of the firm today. The other attorney, Kate [34F], has worked for Jack for about six years and was recently made partner. Kate is married and has an 18-month old toddler.

Jack's wife Megan is a paralegal at the firm. She's awesome. She works from home, so I don't see her a lot, but she's extremely easy to work with, sharp, and is the only laid back person in the firm. Megan works from home so she can take care of Jack and Megan's two teenage kids.

Then there's Karen [79F]. Karen is Jack's mother and our firm administrator. She is in charge of the other paralegals (we generally employ three other paralegals besides Megan). She's very sharp for someone her age, but she has the most abrasive personality of anyone I've met.

As you can see, it's a family-oriented firm. That said, business is good, the firm is growing, and it's relatively laid back and flexible. Jack and Kate are both great attorneys and good mentors. Also, I make better money there than I would in most comparable positions elsewhere. If the firm were to continue to grow as expected, I could presumably be in a position to run the firm in 10-15 years.

The past six months have been hell almost entirely due to Karen. Six months ago Karen became so harsh to the paralegals that all the paralegals other than Megan quit within six weeks of each other. We hired replacements about two months later, and all the replacements quit within four weeks. Practicing became extremely difficult, but I stuck it out. Finally, about a month and a half ago, we hired three great new paralegals and began phasing Karen out of the office. The new paralegals are still learning the ropes, but the future looked bright. I started to think sticking around was worth it.

That was until last night. Last night Jack, Kate and I were out drinking after a conference with some other attorneys. While we were out, Jack pulled me aside and explained that he and Kate are having an affair, they are in love, and it's something they are going to pursue.

Now, I'm not a psychopath. I know this firm is far too problematic to stick with. I interviewed around when the whole Karen nightmare was going on but nothing panned out. I wasn't too aggressive about my job search at the time, but certainly will be now. Nonetheless, I expect it will be a few more months before I'm moving on.

In the meantime, I don't know how to handle myself. I work directly with Megan on a regular basis. I'm helping train the new paralegals and have been trying to establish a stable environment. I feel horrible that Megan does not know this is going on, and I don't want to lie to the paralegals suggesting that the firm is on solid ground when it isn't. Karen is still around in a limited capacity and doesn't know anything either. I don't particularly care for her, but she is Jack's mother and will be involved in the fallout when the dam breaks. Lastly, I have to promote the firm to bring in new clients, and they have no idea things are shaky. Not to mention my current clients that don't know I will likely be leaving soon.

This whole situation is pretty gross, and it doesn't seem like a good idea to bring it up when I'm asked by potential employers why I am moving on. It is notable that my position in this mess gives me some significant leverage for the time-being. I just got a substantial raise (before I was informed of the affair), and I can pretty much dictate my schedule, working from home, days off, etc.

So, what do I do? How to I act towards Megan, Karen, and the other paralegals? What do I do about clients? How urgently do I need to GTFO? Should I take any job I can get just to get out of this mess asap? Should I try to leverage this in my favor outside of gaining some schedule flexibility? Please help me get out of this workplace from hell."
relationship_advice,Don't lead people on," 

Leading someone on feels good in the lowest egoistic way. When my friend/co-worker told me how he felt about me-his voice full of emotion and his eyes full of desire- I didn’t feel sorry for him. I felt embarrassed but I couldn’t stop listening to him. I wanted to be worshipped. I wanted him to tell me how wonderful I was and how he needed me. I saw the way he looked at me before but I didn’t treat him seriously. I made it clear that I am not attracted to him, but I would still be hanging out with him. I knew our meetings weren’t good for him but I didn’t want to stop feeling important to someone. At the same time, I was disgusted with myself, and how pathetic I was to need reassurance, and I despised him for having so little self-respect that he was basically pleading me to keep seeing him. I eventually cut him off (changed jobs not to see him there) and told him that it would be better for us both to finish our relation. He asked me to block him on every single social media because he didn’t trust himself to stay away (sound so creepy, I know). 

I guess what I am trying to say is learn from my example and don’t let your need for validation get in the way of your values. If you don’t like someone TELL THEM and SHOW THEM. If that doesn’t work part ways. This is the best way out of toxic attachment. Thanks for reading"

relationship_advice,Me (21M),"I've decided today that I need to start actually asking women out on a more persevering basis. Because of my vitiligo all over my face and body I never had the confidence to do this in the past. I've just always found it hard to break through that whole dating circuit thing.

I know you are horrified by being approached in public by a stranger and you don't approach strangers neither. Having to make the first move it is like putting yourself in front of a panel for someone to say yay or nay, over and over. All they do is decide if you are good enough for them.

Anyway, one of the main barriers I find to asking someone out is that I'm more afraid that the askee will say ""Yes"" instead of saying ""No"" and that this ""Yes"" will be said out of pity more than anything else, I know I'm tired of the it makes you unique talk.

I've experienced this a few times before, where I'll ask an acquaintance on a date and she sort of winces and says ""Sure"". Then, either she ends up flaking out or I do because I can take a hint. I don't really want to go through a bunch of those again.

I have tried online dating and it is absolutely barren trying to find someone who will match with you and keep a conversation going. It can totally wrecked myself-esteem.

If you said being starved of any kind of positive attention for months or even years on end, then you're correct. Imagine all those compliments and attention you received over your lifespan. Now imagine none if it ever occurred. You now live a life of zero to next to nothing external validation, outward approval, or confirmation of any parts of your life."
relationship_advice,My (25f) boyfriend (28m) pretended to like my cooking for over a year and I don't know how to get over it,"So all of this started in January of 2019 on New Year's day. My boyfriend and I had been together for a little over a year at that point. The new year had caught us snuggled in bed listening to nearby fireworks. I remember asking him if he had any new year's resolutions and him replying that he didn't really have any but that he wanted to get more serious about his health and start eating more home cooked meals. After he said that I immediately came up with the idea of cooking for him. Before then we would normally eat out or order in when we were together. Because of our schedules cooking dinner wasn't an option so I decided to making him lunch during the week. He usually drops me off at work in the mornings so that morning when we were both heading back to work I surprised him with lunch and coffee because he is not really a breakfast person. He seemed genuinely surprised and happy and seeing him happy made me happy. That same night when I was over at his house he went out of his way (before I even asked) to thank me and let me know how much he enjoyed his lunch. 

From then on I've been preparing lunch for him every week day and sometimes on weekends. I would ensure that I stopped by the grocery store or farmers market often to get fresh produce, I would meal prep every night no matter gow tired I was, I would make healthy versions of his favorite meals, I avoided the foods he hated or was allergic to, I made sure to make meals that wouldn't get soggy or inedible in any way by noon, I made a wide variety of dishes, and I even put them in some cute disposable environmentally friendly containers for him. I would always cooks for him when I got the chance to and I would stock his fridge with food he could reheat when he was on his own because he absolutely hated cooking. All of this wasn't a burden at all. I loved doing it for him. For me it was a display of affection and genuine interest in his health. He is not overweight or suffering from any illnesses but his father suffered a heart attack in 2018 so I kinda wanted to steer him from that path. I also benefited from this too. My culinary skills improved and I was getting healtheir too. And through out all of this he constantly showed his appreciation. He showered me with praises for most meals and thanked me often. He even went as far as praising my cooking infront of family, friends and strangers and I'm not going to lie, I loved it. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. He takes me to a company party where I officially got to meet some of his coworkers though I was already familiar with some of them. I ended up bumping into my cousin's bestfriend whose husband also worked at the company. After catching up for awhile she sneakily pulled me outside and told me that my boyfriend has allowed me to become the laughing stock of his work place. She told me that her husband told her that he came to work one morning and announced to everyone that he hated his girlfriend's cooking then he proceeded to throw his lunch into the fridge and tell his coworkers that they had free dibs on it, and that is how the  whole joke started. Apparently, my boyfriend would just abandon his lunch in the fridge everyday and any of his coworkers who didn't have lunch or couldn't be bothered to go out and get any would brave it and eat his lunch instead. They also had a rule that who ever decided to eat his lunch that day would not only have to announce it to everyone but they would have to eat by themselves that day. She said it was a huge thing and even her husband and their BOSS ended up having his lunch at some point. She said her husband tried my Korean beef bowl (I'm assuming it was that one based on what she decsribed was in it) and he really liked it and sometimes the other coworkers liked my meals too but not all the time. 

I don't think I need to mention how shocked, hurt, and embarassed I was. Here I was at his company  party laughing and rubbing shoulders with the same people who are in on the joke. I thanked her and promised her that I wouldn't snitch on her then I called a cab home and sent him a text saying that something came up and I had to leave. The next day I went over to his house and confronted him and after asking repeatedly who told me all of this (with no answer) he came clean and confessed that everything I heard was true but that it was just harmless fun. He said that it's not my cooking he hates, he just doesn't like eating healthy and he didn't know how to tell me to stop without hurtung my feelings because he knows how happy it makes me to cook for him. He apologized a million times that night and told me that it wouldn't happen again and I gave in because, well, I love him and I thought it was something I could eventually get over. But then a few days later I snuck into his phone and looked at one of the group chats he has with some of his friends from work and what I found in it was horrible. They were cracking jokes and sharing memes about my cooking. At one point in the chat history a friend asked him why he was staying with me cause it sure wasn't the cooking and he responded by saying ""Well, the sex is great ;)"" He even sent messages in the group the same night I confronted him telling everyone how he got ""busted"" but he ""smoothed things over"" and they responding with ""freedom at last!"" and ""check under her pillow at night for knives"". But I am not done yet. The nail in the coffin was seeing that he also talked about me in his family group chat and now everyone thinks/knows I'm a bad cook. I even saw a message from his dad saying ""I accidentally lost her cassereole in our fridge after you warned me. Thanks for the heads up son.""

I broke up with him that same night. I've never been so humiliated and crushed in my entire life and I don't think I can ever trust him again. I don't understand how he he could have kept this up for over a year. He would tell me how much he loves my cooking and even go as far as telling me exactly what he loved about each meal. The only hints I ever really got that something was kinda off was when he would always try to get us to eat out on weekends claiming that I needed a break and there was even this one time were I found a week's worth of meals I had prepared for him dumped in his garbage and him saying that he had to dump everything from his fridge because it stopped working for awhile and everything spoiled. Lies on top of lies. 

Now he's telling me that I am taking this way too seriously and that I need to put my pride aside and accept that he didn't mean to hurt me. He says he can't believe I'm willing to throw away our relationship for something as petty as this. He says he wants to marry me. He even called my dad who then called me and told me that I should let it go and try to improve my cooking. I told him that I'll think about it some more but at this point I really don't know. Your advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: Boyfriend pretended to like my cooking for over a year. Found out that his friends, coworkers, and family were in on the joke too. Boyfriend wants me to get over it but I can't."

And what ever... if my boyfriend really doesn’t see that he’s engaging in unhealthy toxic behavior I’m not going to be the one to teach him.

relationship_advice,I (26F) am not sure if I should break up with my boyfriend (28m),"I've gone back and forth in my head for about 6 months now. I honestly have no idea what to do, and cannot talk to anyone about this as our friend group is massively intertwined. Here is some background info: 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 4 years now. Our relationship started off amazing, we have been the ""goals"" couple for all of our friends for the past few years. We moved in with each other 2 years ago. We are very compatible as roommates, living with each other has been overall great. He is a really good guy and up until recently I thought I would spend the rest of my life with him.

About a year ago, my boyfriend slipped into depression - he's dealt with this his whole life, and I have been supportive. This round of depression stemmed from him taking a new job that he hates - it's not so much the job he hates,  but his schedule is VERY inconsistent - lots of different sleeps schedules, and we rarely see each other during the week (both of us have weekends off).  It's taken an immense toll on our relationship. He is just not the same person anymore. We rarely have sex. I can't really show any sort of negative emotions without him jumping to conclusions that I am upset with him (even if I explain it has nothing to do with him). Which has led to me bottling up my own problems, and making me uncomfortable talking with him. Our conversations are shallow and boring. I am extremely bored with our relationship. I've tried ""asking"" him out on dates to keep things interesting, I've tried to plan weekend trips. We took a 5 day vacation to an amazing city and all I could think of was how bored I was with him and how I would have much more fun if I was by myself. I'm constantly thinking about having sex with other men (I won't act on this but fuck it has been tempting). I am just not attracted to him anymore.  I don't miss him or think of him when he is gone. He has sensed that I am not 100% happy with our relationship. He keep saying he doesn't want to lose me and that he has a plan to get better. He never follows through with his plan.

If we didn't have such a deep history, and if we weren't living together, I think I would end things. However, our current lease does not end until August. I really can't afford to move out and sublease the place (our landlord charges a $700 fee to sublease to a new tenant). I would feel horrible about dumping him right before our lease ends (as of right now our plan is to re-sign in August, we really like our place), as most leases in our college town start August 1st. It's really difficult to find leases that start in other months. I also can't imagine telling him I want to break up and then living together for another 7 months. I am also scared he will become suicidal if I break up with him. HELP! What in the hell do I do?!"
relationship_advice,"Fiance wants to have a threesome so our relationship is ""fair""","Throwaway account since I'm quite active on Reddit.


A few months ago, my fiance (23m) and I (23f) invited a friend of his over for drinks and everything got out of hand. We all got absolutely plastered and ended up nearly having a threesome.


There was no penetration and I never even kissed the other guy. We just got naked and fondled each other for a bit. The guys couldn't get it up and I was nausea being on my back, so it ended before it got starting THANKFULLY 


However, my fiance has lots of issues with what happened. He says he feels betrayed that I even let it get as far as it did and feels the only way that would make us equal/me redeemed is by having a threesome with a girl. I'm vehemently against this , didn't ever want to have a threesome and if we hadn't been so irresponsible when drinking we wouldn't have done what we did. I've tried explaining this to him but it falls on deaf ears. 


We're supposed to get married in May and now he's saying that he doesn't know if he can marry me because he doesn't trust me and our relationship is ""unfair."" We've paid a lot of money for this wedding and so have my parents so canceling it is not ideal. But my head says giving in to this won't go well.


I'm really confused about what to do. Is there some sort of compromise here we can make?"
relationship_advice,Should I be bothered? Or should I expect more?,"Hey (21f), every morning I’ll send my SO (23) a good morning text, like “good morning baby/ gorgeous/ sweetness/ beautiful” and sometimes, like once about every other week I’ll wait to see if I’ll get a text first but it makes me very sad that I can guarantee that it won’t happen, and if it does it’s at like 1:00 at the earliest with a “mornin/ hey/good afternoon” or a “hi look at this gorgeous person I saw online” or “look at this band that released pictures”and paragraphs about how beautiful they are. It makes me feel like they don’t want to talk to me or that I’m annoying or unwanted or that maybe I’m too much when I say good morning to them. Or that if I don’t say anything then they’ll never say hi. Maybe I’m thinking too much into it and I should just be happy with being the one to say good morning?"
relationship_advice,"Finding Someone who makes me feel nervous again, but having a girlfriend.","I am a 19 years old male, i have a relationship about 2 years and a half with a girl that i still love.

In high school, i meet this girl, with whom i rapidly became friends with, she was an ice-cold girl, she didn't like to say much, time passes, and she begins to became more and more comfortable with me, now i am the person she feels more comfortable with, i love her, but she always have been always a little childish, likes to be with me all day, cuddling or so, but doesn't have a great sexual desire, she has never masturbated, and i am a have a very few fetish that i can never accomplish, she doesn't like to have sex often, but i do, and a lot, so we always tend to have trouble because of sex.

i have entered a gym 5 min from home, where i meet this girl, whom is a extrovert person, shes a very good looking girl and have a strong adult woman energy, she always is full of energy to do more and more exercise, and have one or two laugh every day that i went to the gym.

without knowing, i am feeling nervous around her, i feel bad because i am in a relationship, but she represent like all the ""adult"" things that i would like my girl to be, more aggressive and competitive, more sexual or so on, my friends tells me to try and get an opportunity with this fit girl, they say she has giving me hint (i am very dumb to get them), but i dont want to ruin my 2 years relationship just because my sexual drive, i have been thinking about quitting the gym so i dont see her and focus in my relationship again, but i dont know.... what do you think i should do?"
relationship_advice,I’m (19M) losing my best friend (18F),"I’ve talked about this before but it’s getting so much worse now. She started dating her boyfriend in October 2019. Me and her have been best friends for 3+ years now and I know that I’m losing her to him. I’ve lost girl best friends to boyfriends before so I should be use to it but it hurts so much more worse now.

This is her first real relationship and all she does is hang with him, which idc that’s fine. But she’s already lost most of her best friends because of him. And she doesn’t talk to anyone else besides me, him and this other girls she’s been off and on best friends with for the last 3 years and they just started being friends again like a few weeks ago.

And everytime I talk to her now it feels painful because yeah we’re laughing and joking but it just feels different. And all she can tell me whenever I bring it up is “it’s just our friendship doesn’t feel the same” that’s all she tells me. It’s like she doesn’t even wanna try to fix it. It’s like she got him now so nothing else matters and it’s frustrating because she stressed so much to me that this relationship wouldn’t change her and it clearly has but she’s so in denial that she doesn’t see it

Not to mention she gets mad at me over the littlest things now at me. The slightest thing I say and she thinks im being sarcastic or whatever and I have to explain to her I’m not. Like I said I’ve lost people to boyfriends before but this hurts because we spent literally everyday talking and communicating and so much more. And it feels like she’s throwing it away. Even her sister said she’s throwing away all her friendships for a “stupid boy” (in her words)

TL:DR - I’m losing my best friend and I have no idea what to do.."
relationship_advice,"When playing hard to get (30F) with a man (40M) and giving him the cold shoulder, is it better to live it up on social media and make my life look great, or go totally silent and leave him wondering where I am?"," **When playing hard to get with a man and giving him the cold shoulder, is it better to live it up on social media and make my life look great, or go totally silent and leave him wondering where I am?**   FWIW, I""m doing this to gauge where he stands because he was playing games first."
relationship_advice,My (24f) SO (26m) of 4 years isn't over his past and I don't know how to move forward.,"When he was in high school he was best friends with a group of girls, one of which he was head over heels for. He says he and this girl would try dating but then she would get with someone else instead. Basically this cycle of stringing him along went on for all 4 years of high school and a little after. She would constantly talk about him to the new guys she dated...making her boyfriends at the time jelous of my SO and in turn making him think she still had feelings for him. 

When I started dating my SO he told me about this girl  and I was weary of going into it, but he reassured me he was over her and the whole situation.  

Cut to present day and I have come to notice that it doesn't seem like my SO is over this situation. This girl has managed to pop up into our lives at least once a year for the last 4 years...usually its brief and we get past it, but this time is different. 

In october of last year my SO started getting random notes of encouragement placed on his windshield while at school (we're in college). He told me about this and later admitted to me that he thought these letters were from this same girl in his past, I'd like to add that he was very sure of it even though he didn't know who the actual sender was (because the handwriting was the same?) These letters were getting to him, he seemed distraught and not really there when we were together, so I confronted him about it and asked why it was affecting him so much if he was over it...he told me he feels forgotten by this group of girls he called his best friends...they don't invite him to major milestone events of theirs and he is saddened by the fact that he lost his best friends over this one girl. He says he doesn't hate her, just wants his friends back.  We had a long conversation which eventually led to me telling him to ask her if it really was her doing this...few hours later TADA! Turns out it wasn't her!!! Prior to this fiasco before we know if it was her or not, I asked him if it turns out to be her and she wants something with him again, what does it make me...he said he didn't know. 

Now this led to months of crying...I couldn't get past the idea that maybe he's using me until she decides that she does like him and wants to be with him. He told me he wouldn't throw away our 4 years to be with her...but why say he didn't know what it would make me if it had been her...I keep thinking if it had been her, would he have left me then and there? 

Now its a new semester and this girl is in one of my SOs classes, once again he is distraught. We talked about it again and he told me the same story about losing his friends...he says he feels sadness and shame when he see's her. I told him that the only way for this to end is if he takes the iniative to talk to her and hash everything out because its obvious hes holding onto something from the past even though he says he's over it. He agreed to talk to her this upcoming tuesday after class. 

I don't know what to do, I feel like I've tried being emotionally supportive over the last four years, in fact I've given it my all. Now its getting to me...I feel angry and keep thinking that I don't deserve to be put through this. I keep teeling myself that I would never do this to him. I feel like I want to break up with him but at the same time don't know if it's me thinking selfishly, am I right to feel this way?"
relationship_advice,How can I fix this? My (25f) partner (25m) doesnt follow agreements and is always unemployed,"This is a repost after there was a misubderstanding with my previous post. I hope its clearer now.

My partner (m25) and I (25f) used to be long distance for 2 years and then he moved country within europe to live with me.

Well hes been living here for 2 years now and in that time he had jobs for a total of 8 months in 4 different companies. At first I believed him that it was a language and cultural barrier but seeing as he spent all day playing games and i always had to sit next to him for him to write applications i dont believe that anymore. I worked a gruelling job that completely wrecked me emotionally and physically to sustain our life and after a few months of him being unemployed and making no effort to go out and get better at the language we had several long talks at the end of which he at least started picking up housework. He does most of the housework now and its still very messy but livable. By that point I was so burnt out i could barely function.

By August i switched to a job that wasnt as painful and my partner also managed to get a job again. 1 month later he tells me he fucked up at work and broke sth expensive, surprisingly he wasnt fired but a week later he came home with pain in his hand, the doctor said he had tendonitis, he called in sick for 2 weeks and afterwards (against mine or the doctors advise) went back to work and was fired on the spot. Now hes home again since November.

So in early January he apparently failed to transfer his part of the rent, and hadnt even told me, which landed me an upset call from the landlord WHILE I WAS AT WORK (i work in real estate and this DID NOT LOOK GOOD) and i flipped. I told him that if he didnt find a job by January 31st id be gone. I know i was cruel and reacted too harsh but I was terrified after the call and flipped out. He works in a field that is desperately wanted here and theres plenty of jobs in the area, and even if he didnt want that he could go to a hiring company and theyd find sth for him! My salary is not enough to pay for the full rent, and groceries and he knows that.

Anyway today I came home from work and he was in bed lamenting all about how he fainted while getting shots so he needs to go to the doctor first thing monday morning. He didnt adress the deadline at all. I know that if i dont adress it he will never do it and the relationship could continue on like nothing ever happened.

The only thing he told me about is that he went to a hiring agency that immediately offered him a job last monday but i dont know if he ever replied to that. He is a great person aside from the whole job thing and deeply care about him and i definitely dont want to tell him its over but i feel i have no way of fixing this. I want to do sth so that theres real physical consequences.

My sister says i am an asshole because he loves me a whole lot, that its not his fault he cant find a job and that i should just forgive him.

But i want to do sth. I dont know how or what but i dont want to live in constant financial terror! 

What can I do?"
relationship_advice,Reconciliation..,"Wife left a week ago dad said I would get papers in the mail.

Things have come up that have forced us to talk ableit briefly. Mostly financial and thats it.

I texted her today saying in a couple weeks are you open about talking to fix this or do you still want to go for a divorce.

She said maybe.

I said let's think for two weeks on things that need to change and she said ok. So basically ball is still in her court on what she would want to do.... imo

My Parents think I messed up and that I'm reinviting the soup back in. I kinda concur with that but my life is better with her than without her.. I do know that if we reconcile there are going to have to be hard things done for her to come back. I'm not just going to let her walk all over me.

If we cant come to an agreement then we split. I'm at least happy either way and I still feel like she has to make a choice to get back with me.. if she doesnt call in two weeks I know my anwswer..

relationship_advice,My boyfriend [25/M] of 8 years called me [25/F] a sad little woman because I said he was being hypocritical about something.,"My boyfriend and I have been going through a rough patch recently. 

He’s trying to start a business and so all of his energy is going into that which means we’re spending a lot less quality time together at the moment.

This evening we were playing a game together and he was getting frustrated at another player. He said the person was stealing all the items and I laughed and said he was being hypocritical because he has previously told me that at the start of the game it’s every man for himself in terms of grabbing items.

So for some reason he took massive offence to this and was saying that I was being a cock and I asked how because he had literally told me that previously. He then called me a sad little woman and kept berating me so I left the chat.

We cooled off in different rooms for a while and then he came to tell me he was going out. I said I felt the way he spoke to me was kind of disgusting and he said that I induced it and of course he was going to react.

He said that I intended to wind him up by calling him hypocritical, despite me saying I wasn’t, and that I know he’s stressed at the moment. 

He then said ‘I apologise but’ and I said that wasn’t an apology. He then said that he didn’t really care so I said there was no point continuing the conversation.

I don’t know how to feel. I really want to talk this out with a friend but most of our friends are mutual and I feel like I can’t talk to them.

TL;DR: my [25/F] bf [25/M] said I was a sad little woman and that he doesn’t care."
relationship_advice,How can I(35F) improve my relationship with my niece (16F)?,"I am a 35-year-old woman and I require some advice regarding my niece's (16F) behavior. My niece (brother's daughter) lives in a relatively small town - the kind where almost everyone knows everyone else. Her parents and the people around her believe that she is the most beautiful girl in town and do their best to flatter her about her looks instead of encouraging her to do well in high school or in her tennis classes. Her mother believes she has the potential to be a tennis champion and an oscar-winning actress too (I'm not exaggerating). She paid me a visit during the Christmas vacation. Her mother (my sister in law) was with her as well.

Throughout the week, my sister in law narrated boring tales about how difficult life is for a mother of a beautiful girl. She has to be protected from the predators (boys) in school and suspicious relatives who might abuse her. I was so bored that I challenged my niece to a game of tennis instead. Her mother warned me that I was going to get wallopped. Surprisingly, my niece turned out to be quite an average badminton player and received a thrashing instead of giving me one. She failed to win a single game despite the fact that I am beyond my peak fitness levels. She shook my hands at the net and puckered her lips to give me a kiss on the cheek when her mother arrived.

I was stunned to notice that she withdrew her hand immediately from mine and ran to her mother. Her mother was furious to know that she had lost and might have even hit her had I not intervened. The girl kept telling her mother that she had sprained her foot in the first game, although I am certain that nothing of that sort happened. She spent the entire day locked up in her room. When she ran into me in the dining space, she said ""sorry"" and went back to her room again. I have no idea what is wrong with her. Is it not my duty to ensure her well-being? Why did she not admit defeat when she lost fair and square? Maybe her mother keeps telling her I am a bad person. What can I do to improve our relationship?

TL;DR: My niece behaved quite badly after a tennis match with me. I did not gloat over my victory or hurt her feelings. Why did she not admit defeat graciously? How can I help her if she is feeling upset about something?"
relationship_advice,Haunted by a girl who ghosted me.,"Hi, I'm 29 and just your everyday average guy with average looks, average hobbies, and an all around average life. Like everyone else, all I want is to find a girl who loves me for who I am and never do anything to hurt me, but I've never had much luck. I've had a few flirtations here and there, but nothing really came from them. I was pretty much  not noticed throughout high school. Girls only talked to me when they wanted me to help them with their homework. I guess you could say I was something of copy of a certain comic book character you all know before he got his powers (Peter Parker, Spider-Man). After graduation I was tired of being ignored by girls and picked on for being so skinny. So I bought some weights, really committed, and by the time I reached my mid twenties my body became very muscular and people really started to notice and I haven’t been pushed around since. Unfortunately, girls still didn't notice me much.



So I tried online dating since it seemed to be the way most couples meet nowadays. It worked for my sister who met her now husband on a dating app. I joined tinder and swiped right on a bunch of girls, but nothing really happened. I wondered what I was doing wrong? I worked hard to make myself a more attractive guy and I really don't think anyone would refer to me as ""ugly"". I’m nice, respectful, physically fit, smart, and caring. So why am I not getting any attention from girls? Everyone tells me that the one for me will only come when the time is right. I still don’t know what that means if no one pays any attention to me, how am I supposed to meet anyone? Then one day I matched with a girl named Hanna. She was beautiful, and I couldn't believe she swiped right on me. We started to talk and to my surprise, she wanted to know everything about me as much as she possibly could. This was a new feeling for me. It wasn't often someone wanted to talk to me so frequently. I treaded cautiously while talking with her, as I’m well of aware of all the dangers that come with meeting someone online. She told me her last name and I was able to find her on Facebook, so I sighed in relief when I learned I wasn't being catfished and she was a real girl. After a few days of chatting and getting to know each other, she gave me her number so we could text each other and talk on the phone instead of using Tinder. This was a first, but we started texting each other and she seemed happy to always hear from me. It wasn't long before I started to get excited thinking I may have this beautiful girl as a girlfriend pretty soon. She seemed to be everything I look for in a girl: smart, polite, dresses nice, pretty hair, and she was taller than me at 6""1, I know that sounds weird but I've always had a thing for tall girls, and she liked the fact that I liked tall girls.



Everyday we'd constantly talk about what we were doing, things we like, past stories and experiences that made us who we are, and things only two people who really liked each other would share with each other. She told me about the guys she's dated in the past and how one physically abused her and another actually raped her and she still had nightmares about both of them. When I told her that I wasn’t capable of doing anything like either of those things to anyone and she acted like she'd been waiting to meet someone like me her entire life. When I told her about how I never had a girlfriend, she couldn't believe it. She said I sounded like a knight in shining armor that any girl would fantasize about. My heart fluttered because I've waited a long time to hear a girl say that, so I lowered my guard and talked freely with her like I would with a close friend. It was so easy to talk to her, it really felt like we were really building a real relationship here. The only problem was she lived about 30 miles away from me, and my current car was pretty old and would often breakdown so I couldn’t drive too far from home. She reassured me that that was ok, and I was definitely worth a 30 mile car ride to see. We talked about things we would do together, things we'd do if we were in the same room, and admitted to each other that we were imagining kissing each other. To know that she wanted to kiss me and do all these things with me, I couldn't believe my luck. It really felt like I was being rewarded for the years I spent being an invisible nobody wishing for a girl to notice me.



For weeks we constantly texted each other, we talked on the phone a few times, and sent videos of ourselves to each other. From the moment I woke up each day to text from her til I fell asleep talking with her late at night, I've never been so happy. Of course I wanted to meet Hanna face to face as soon as possible, but as long as she was still talking to me, I was happy. The problem seemed to be that every time I was available to meet, she wasn't and every time she was available to meet, I wasn't. We kept promising each other that we would eventually meet and we both couldn't wait. One day, she seemed to be having a hard day and kept saying she wished I was with her right now. The best thing I could think to do was to send her a picture of myself that a friend took of me while I was working out and my biceps were on display. Her reaction to the picture was not what I had expected. She didn't just like it, she went nuts over it and our conversation that night got very....dirty. You could say we kinda sexted. That was the best night of my life, knowing that this beautiful girl wants me in the ways she said. She told me that she was so happy she met me and couldn't wait for us to meet in person. I still remember her telling me I made her feel like her “soul was on fire in the best way”. Those words will always stay with me, but not for the reasons you’d think...



At this point I felt like we were already boyfriend and girlfriend. So naturally I was the happiest I've ever been and the people around me took notice. So I mentioned to them that I had met someone special, and they congratulated me as they've always wanted to see me this happy and with someone. When I told Hanna that I mentioned her to a few people, she acted uneasy and said maybe I shouldn't tell people about her. I found it odd for her to say that, but I thought she was just being shy. I shrugged it off, after all I was pretty shy about meeting the people in her life too so it didn’t raise any red flags in my mind. Then one day, Hanna didn't text me in the morning and I waited for her to reply to me. A full day psst and I texted her again asking if she was ok. She replied and said she was fine, but couldn't talk. I said I understood if she was busy, and to just text me when she could. Another day past and she didn't text me once, so I texted her again asking if she was ok. This time she immediately replied and apologized for being so distant. She told me she was busy packing for trip to Boston. I figured she was going on a vacation and I asked when she was leaving and when she'd be back. The next thing she told me was one of the worst things I’ve ever heard. She told me she was going there to ""go apartment shopping"". I asked what she meant by that, and she told me it was her dream to live there and it was finally time for her to start moving there to live the rest of her life. It felt like someone dropped 100lbs on my chest. I was dumbfounded and couldn't bring myself to ask her all the questions I wanted to: So what was this? Where do I fit in your plan? If this was your plan all along, why were you on a dating app looking for someone who lived close to you? Why did you lead me on to think we were going to have a relationship? But I was too shocked so I just told her I wasn't feeling well now and that I'd text her tomorrow. I didn't sleep that night at all. All I could do was cry, and I cried so much that my eyes looked like red tomatoes and my nose started to bleed from running so much. I’ve never been so heartbroken!



The next day I texted her and told her that it was wrong to lead me on to think that she wanted me as her boyfriend and that we'd have a real relationship. After all we talked about doing together, she actually didn’t mean any of it, and now she was going to leave me behind and move to another state. She replied saying she was in tears and said she shouldn't have messaged me. I couldn't bring myself to yell at her and let out all my frustration, but I wanted to know if she meant anything she said to me, but she didn't reply to any of my texts after that one, and when I tried calling her, it went straight to voicemail. It wasn't long til I realized she blocked me. I couldn't believe it, the girl I spent so much time getting to know that made me so happy, just tossed me aside like I was nothing. I had no way of talking to her ever again! The best thing to ever happen to me was gone. I began to think that this was so typical, and I blamed myself for not thinking that this was too good to be true. I hated my life, I hated myself, and my anger was all I felt now. People were starting to notice how angry I seemed, so I had to pretend like everything was fine, not wanting to tell them everything that had just happened to me. For weeks I lost myself to anger, wondering what I had done to deserve this kind of pain. All I was left with was questions. Why did she do this to me? Did she ever like me? Was it all a lie? What do I do now?



It was hard to come to grips with but after a week of depression I came to the harsh conclusion that Hanna wasn't coming back and I need to move on however I could. So I rejoined Tinder hoping lightning would strike the same spot twice. I figured it was a long shot, but there was no harm in trying. This time I included in my bio that I have no interest in talking to anyone who even had a little thought about moving out of the state at any point. After awhile, I did match with someone. Her name was Kim, and she was cute. We started talking and she seemed nice enough and said she would never leave the state as her family means too much to her. We spoke freely just like Hanna and I did before, and when we both agreed that we trust each other now, we exchanged phone numbers. Kim had what I wish Hanna had, the motivation to actually meet up in person. She wanted to go out on an actual date and after telling me she would pick me up because of my car trouble, I agreed. Now I was super nervous. I'm going out on an actual date with a girl. When the night came, I dressed as nice as I could, kept telling myself to not blow it, and tried my best to relax. We went to dinner and talked and then we went to a local park afterwards to talk more. The date lasted four hours, and things went pretty well until the very end when I moved in to kiss her. I was so nervous I pretty much missed her lips. She said we should try again and we both kinda missed again. After a third try we got it right enough and said goodnight and that we'll talk later. I spent the rest of the night reflecting on what just happened. I actually went on my first date. Was it how I always imagined it? Hard to say really. I did notice I felt a lack of love struck happiness. I always thought that after my first date I'd go home feeling like the luckiest guy in the world, but I didn't. It’s hard to describe how you feel about something you’re not really used to experiencing so  I thought things would get better and easier the more I date Kim.



We kept going out on dates every week for about two months and we agreed to be boyfriend and girlfriend. It felt like every time we went out I liked her a little more, and she certainly liked me. Then came a weekend where I invited Kim over to my place and we spent the entire weekend watching TV and movies, eating, talking, and kissing. This was something I've always wanted to happen, and when the weekend was over I wasn't especially sad. I kept wondering why I wasn't insanely happy. I FINALLY have a girlfriend that really likes me that I can talk to, hug, and kiss. I kept thinking about the last time I was extremely happy, and that was when I was talking with Hanna. That's when it hit me. No matter what I told myself, I wasn't over Hanna, and I was only using Kim to get over her. I couldn't believe it. I've become the very thing I hate: a liar and a user. I’m lying to Kim  and myself by saying that I'm over my last love encounter and that I'm happy having Kim as my girlfriend. I couldn't go on like this any longer. So the next time I talked to Kim, I told her how I felt and broke up with her. She understood, but I know I upset her. I'm sure I was to her what Hanna was to me, everything she ever wanted. I made poor Kim feel the same why Hanna made me feel, and I hated that! But I couldn't go on dating Kim like everything was ok when it wasn't. I know was going to miss me, but I know a nice girl like her will find someone better than me. Still, I couldn't believe what I just did. I never thought I would be the one to end a relationship with a girl.



As time goes on I find that I still miss Hanna and how she made me feel. But in my heart I know that she's not coming back. It was wrong for me to jump back into dating so soon after a heartbreak like that. Clearly, I wasn't ready for a new relationship, and Kim paid the price. I would advise everyone watching to never start dating again after a breakup of any kind. Give yourself enough grieving time that the person no longer matters to you. But here I am, back to square one. It's been some time since Hanna broke my heart and I don’t know what I can do to get her out of my head. I know she’s not coming back, but I still want someone like her to talk to. It took so long for me to find her, I’m scared that I’m never going to meet anyone like her ever again. What do you think I should do to move on from Hanna? Have you ever been lied to by someone you thought cared about you? Did I do a bad thing by agreeing to go out with Kim and then dumping her? Do you have any sad dating stories? Let me know in the comments below."
relationship_advice,So there’s a gas station I go by my house to kinda often maybe once a week and there’s always this really cute girl at the front counter and last time I went i went to go Myself a coffee but she said “oh no you don’t gotta pay for that have a good day” and I was like are you sure,And she was like yes and I asked for her name and she said Brittany  and then I left I wanna ask for her Snapchat but I’m really shy should I do it or no??
relationship_advice,How do I tell my really good friend I don't return her romantic feelings without sounding like a jerk?,"Obligatory apologies for mobile formatting. TL;DR at bottom. 

Okay, so my love life has been unique to say the least, I've tried dating a few people but only ever had one long term relationship where I knew I loved that person. A few years ago, the person I loved decided that they didn't feel the same and dropped me like garbage, which took me years to get over and convince myself that I wasn't completely worthless. I was doing pretty good with putting it behind me and moving on, until about 6 months ago when my ex broke up with her new bf and immediately wanted to start hanging out again. Me being the soft idiot I am, went head over heels into this really believing she wanted me again and that I wasn't just being used. Surprise surprise, same thing happens again and I get dropped when she gets bored and finds something more interesting, except this time her friends actually saw what she did to me and started hanging out with me without her and just letting me into their friend group. They ended up being some of the coolest people I've ever met, especially her friend J. J and I really vibed on our feelings and how we've both gone through stuff like that and also we just have alot in common, so it's made it alot easier to take my mind off my ex. But I've been hanging out with J so much and talking about feelings and stuff that she started to like me in a way which I didn't feel, but I know how shitty it is being lonely and not having anyone to talk to and I can't bring myself to explain to her how I liked it better when we were just chilling as friends. I don't want her to think I don't like her or anything because I really do enjoy spending time with her, but I just don't really want to be dating the friend of my Ex like right after she just helped me get over it. Now her and all her friends are so happy she finally has a man and I don't want to ruin that for her, but I liked it how it was when I was just their friend and I feel really guilty that i'm not feeling this as much as she is. I don't ever want to be like my ex and make people feel thrown away and used, so that's why I'm so worried over how to handle this. Any advice would be very welcome

TL;Dr : My ex's friends saw how she treated me and brought me into their friend group to help me feel better and get over it. I grew very close with one of them over the last few weeks, but now she has feelings for me that I feel guilty for not returning in the same way. How do I deal with this without hurting her?"
relationship_advice,Should i say sorry to someone that i pushed away because of my wounded inner child?,"I met this guy online, we had chemistry and strong passion. It was a long distance relationship, he planned to come to see me and we agreed that we’ll meet on Thanks Giving and Christmas. He was a really nice guy, intellectual, humorous, spontaneous and especially, honest. But because i had a bad break up previously and there are so many wounds and doubts about love, i pushed him away because i’m insecure. I cut him off, saying that we’re not meant to be. He hurts badly and we have not talked much since then. Later on i spent months coming inward, healing myself and still missing him everyday, i regret because i pushed a nice guy away from my life but at that point in my life, i was afraid that i’d get hurt like last relationship. Recently i’ve seen his picture with a new gf, they look so happy together and i really hope all the best for them. However, i feel lonely and hopeless. I had an delusion that one day when i could heal myself completely, we’d have a chance together just to realize that no one waits for me when i rejected his love. I know it hurts for him. I always want to say an apologize, but i dont think it’s a good idea. I want him to know that there’s nothing wrong about him, what i did is because i think i’m underserved of his love. Anw, he moves on and be happy. Why should i be here thinking about an untold apologize which he may not care about anymore.
How can i move on? And should i move on with an untold apologize?"
relationship_advice,I [19M] and my girlfriend [19F] have some issues and I just need some help/advice because I don't know how to deal with it.,"I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year now, and our relationship has always been a little rocky. In the beginning, she didn't see us as compatible so it took a few changes on both ends for us to truly think we could work. Then, about 4 months in, she admitted that there was another guy who she had been texting for about 2 weeks, and that it was very flirty, but she felt so wrong and chose to stop. I knew this guy personally, so I cut him off, and told her that she has to cut him off to if she wants us to work in any way. She did, but this man would use different numbers to try to text her, and thankfully she would tell me each time that he would text her, and her replies would be ""I can't talk to you"", ""Stop trying to contact me"", etc., which was pleasing to see. Unfortunately, about 10 months into our relationship, she met someone and they became friends. This friend was lesbian, and she had regained my trust because she truly had been open and communicating with me throughout. I knew of this friend for a while because they would hang out a lot, and they would watch movies together, but one night she told me that this friend tried to kiss her while they were watching a movie. I said it's fine since she claimed she did not return the kiss, but about 2 months later, her sister told me that she was too ashamed to admit something about the situation, and then my girlfriend mentioned in regret that she actually did return the kiss and that she was so scared that I'd break up with her that she didn't tell me for that reason. After learning this information, I did the same thing like the first guy, and told her to stop talking to her, and she did a fairly good job but the only problem was that she told the girl that her parents found out about it and wanted her to stop talking, not that I found out. I was aware of this and allowed her to say this, but the girl figured that since they were in college, and the parents weren't around, that they could still say ""Hi"" in the halls and stuff. I told my girlfriend that I was very uncomfortable about this, and 1 thing led to another and my girlfriends roommate was told about it and she said she would help in ensuring that she would start locking the dorm and keeping her accountable. Now, it's not because my girlfriend wasn't avoiding her, but the roommate just wanted to make sure that things would go as smooth as possible. It's been 2 months now and she's been working extremely hard to regain my trust, and it's taking time, but I would like to believe she's changed this time. Now believe me, I know I'm stupid, I know I should've ended it a while ago, but I promise you guys, we're done if she does even the smallest thing of stupidity. Also, I know the quote ""Cheaters never change."" and stuff like that, so no, you don't need to comment that. Both of these things are pretty minor ""cheating"" occasions, but of course they're still cheating so I don't just let her get away with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Minor note: I watched porn during our relationship and she considered that cheating because I was looking at naked women which is valid, and even though I said I stopped, I didn't because well, it's obvious, but this time I've seriously stopped so, figured I'd just say that. She considered it basically ""even"" in that we both cheated on each other once, but she knows they're different situations entirely. 

  
Just wanted to get some advice, anything helps honestly. Thanks for reading."
relationship_advice,Girl called me buddy. Is there likely no hope?,"this girl I’ve been talking to for over a week from tinder everyday and will be meeting next week asked me when my quiz was. I said 12:20 and she said “uh oh one hour buddy” does she likely only see me as a friend?

Just last night we FaceTimed for over an hour and we talk throughout most the day so I expected there to be some interest at least.  She also does have a sarcastic attitude but yeah. She’s called me dude like two times and said the line “oh no you don’t my friend” before too.  When I responded with “yeah pal” she didn’t take notice of me calling her pal or anything Am I likely out of the running?"
relationship_advice,OP (M26) is wondering if it's normal-ish for GF (F22) to go on a trip to a cabin alone with a girl-friend while bringing her sex toy,"First off, I tried my best to not make this title accusatory or too ""biased"", I acknowledge that there may be facts and sides to this that I haven't considered and that's why I'm posting the question here for consideration.

My (m26) girlfriend (22) of approx. 1 1/2yrs. just headed off to the cabin for an evening with a female friend in a couple close to us, we're close to this couple and I consider them both good friends. Me and the boyfriend is supposed to join them tomorrow as the girls expressed the desire for a ""girls night"" which I whole heartedly support.

In December I bought my GF a vibrator which the store recommended as an easy-starter for someone curious to sex toys. This was because I know she hasn't had much sexual experience compared to me, she had said she wanted to try sometime and I wanted to help her along on her journey as I consider sex to be important, both together and alone.

She hasn't touched it since she got it, understandably because she hasn't had the time to settle in alone and try it out. I also know that the girl-friend also bought toys recently and that they openly talk about this as is normal.

The thing I'm reacting to is that I noticed (by mistake really) that the vibrator suddenly was gone from the bedroom when she left. She also noted that she was going to share the bed with our girl-friend, so she wanted me to bring extra bed sheets tomorrow.

I'm a naturally anxious guy who has had trust issues pretty much my whole life, I've done a lot to deal with this and try to be aware of my impulses. I'm trying to consider the possibilities that there's nothing wrong here, f.ex. that they're going to show the toys to each other or something, but the part about sharing beds makes my jealous brain go a bit off the walls. There's been no red flags at all in our relationship and I don't want to think anything's going on, but what do y'all think?

My options as I see them is to accept that nothing is probably going on and to let this be, the other option is to talk with her tomorrow. I don't want to accuse her of something she most likely hasn't done and I'd like as much feedback as possible in case there's something I haven't thought about.

TL;DR: GF brought a vibrator to a girls-night with a common friend which she's also going to share a bed with, anxious guy trying to deal with his trust issues is hoping he's just being too anxious."
relationship_advice,My boyfriend is making me feel guilty about his decision to join the military.,"So me and my boyfriend have been dating for about 5 years. We have been living together for the past year. I've known that his dream his whole life was to join the military, but up until a couple of weeks ago, he said that was behind him. One day out of the blue, he told me that he was going to join the Air Force. I was shocked, sad, but overall happy for him. For five years he's struggled with finding what he wants to do, and if this is what he wants to do, of course I'm going to be supportive. This was a few weeks ago now, and since then things have been progressing and we estimate he'll be shipping off to basic training sometime around April or May. 

Now for the issue, he is making me feel guilty for planning my life after he leaves. He has always been an emotion guy, and is very distraught over how sad he is to leave his life behind for the military. When I found a new apartment for myself (because our current lease is up in May, thankfully), he was sad and didn't want me to talk about the new place. I was very excited after touring it and wanted to show him pictures but that basically just made him cry. He told me it made him too sad to think of me getting a new place without him.

I've also asked him, that if for some reason his deployment is delayed for a short amount of time, if he would be staying with his dad. This is because once we move out of the place we share, and I go to my new place, I don't want to move all his stuff into my place, and then not know when he's going to be leaving. Because he could be called up one weekend and have to be gone by the next, I feel it would just be simpler if he stayed at his dad's for a short time where he would have a room and all his stuff. This also made him very upset, and he was crying and saying that he didn't want to spend his last few weeks not living with me, and he suggested I find a place for the both of us to sign a lease (even though I would have no clue how long he'll be here). 

Then lastly, today I needed the license number from him for our dog, so I could include it on an apartment application. She is technically his dog, as he had her for two years before we moved in together. But she's always known me, and even then I would still pay for some of her things. Since we've lived together, I have paid for most of her things, taken her to the vet, buy her food, etc. She's very attached to me (more so than him, which I feel guilty about but I know it's not my fault) and I love her very much. When I asked for the license, he looks for it but then realizes that it expired quite some time ago. He can't afford a new one. So I offered to buy her a new permanent one under my name since I was going to be taking care of her by myself since he's leaving for the military. He told me that he's transferring ownership to me, and I'm fine with this. However a couple hours after I bought her a new license he calls me crying saying that he's in so much pain for letting me do this and that he feels like he's abandoning his child. He said he wants the license to be in his name, even though I'm the one paying for it and I'm the one that's taking care of her. So once again, I'm made to feel guilty even though he's the one that's leaving her and giving her to me.

I just don't know how much more of this I can take. I have told him multiple times that he needs to stop making me the bad guy here. I am being supportive of everything he is doing. Of course I'd like for him to stay, but if he thinks this is what is best then I'm going to be supportive. But I am so tired of getting met with sobbing and guilt tripping every time I try and make plans for my own future. It makes me feel like I am doing something wrong. Part of me thinks that perhaps he doesn't want to do the military, but I have told him many times that if he's having doubts then he can pull back. He said he definitely doesn't have any doubts. I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so guilty and tired for a decision that he is making to leave me and the dog behind. I guess I'm just looking for some opinions on the what's going on."
relationship_advice,I made a mistake and i want to fix it!!," Hi everyone! 

I(20M) know a girl(20F) online we've been talking 5 months now we're not at the same country but we planned to meet this summer, our relation is so good we talk everyday and i know that there is smthg there because of the way she treats me.

Yesterday night, i made a mistake after getting emotional when she told smthg, i told her that i love her, i know it wasn't good to say it now at least we need to meet but i dunno how i said that. well her answer was ''i dunno what to say, my feelings are confused, i don't want to mess it up'' then i said ''it's ok i'm just saying what i feel'' so she answered '' i feel so bad, i don't wanna hurt you'' and after that she said ''have a good night with a heart emoji''.

we didn't talk from then, i dunno what to do, i should have a little patience, i don't want to lose her, should i explain that i know that i rushed  and say that things should continue normally between us.Or wait for her to say smthg.

I'm so confused, i know that what's between us is serious, so i still have faith.

Finally Thanks to everyone who read this and answered me, i wish you all a good life."
relationship_advice,How to go about ending things with a person who suffers from depression?,"Hi y'all, I'll keep this short. I (24m) have been with my girlfriend (22f) for about six months now. It's been pretty fun, but I kind of feel like things are on their way out, and I believe it's for the best if we go our separate ways. We don't connect much anymore, we're not physically intimate, etc.

My girlfriend suffers from chronic depression, and has been in a pretty tough spot for the last couple of weeks. I know I want to end things with her, but of course I don't want to seem like an absolute monster for breaking up with someone who is in such a bad place. 

Any advice on how I should go about handling this? I really don't want to hurt her, I just want to end things as cleanly as possible. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks."

We were playing a little game of questions. She asked me questions that were randomly generated on her phone and I would answer with what I knew.

She then proceeded to ask who would be my girlfriend based on a random letter she got on her phone. It was all good until it landed on the letter ""I"".

I immediately said ""hell no!"" because my ex-girlfriend's name starts with ""I"" and it was the first thing that popped up in my mind.

My friend's name starts with an ""I"" as well, which resulted with her being angry saying:

""What do you mean 'hell no'?! What about me huh? You dont want to date me? You dont consider me as your girlfriend?""

I tried to justify saying about my ex, but she just pouted and looked to the side.

Is this a sign she is interested? Or it's nothing important? Am I insane? Im still confused and dont know what to make of this.

Me and (we'll call her Melissa) Melissa were kinda together for a bit but couldn't keep it tight because we never really saw each other. That was last May

So last night Melissa was snapchatting me. Idk how drunk she was or if she was drunk at all but she was calling me a ""really nice guy"" and saying I was super funny. She might've even called me hot but I didnt hear it over the music. She did ask me if I have a girlfriend on video though.

So I ended up there at 3 am. I couldn't roll the blunt even though I was sober so we just drank. She gets to asking me questions about music and rap which she knows I like and were chilling. I was very nervous to be honest. Us three were all drunk to a degree so we just fucked around doing anything. 

Her friend also has a BF so when the convo brought up his name here and there she would in a way ""retaliate"" and talk about Melissa's BF which I'm fully aware about. Each time Melissa would turn the convo around and never even said his name around me.

Her friend was really tired so ended up falling asleep for two seconds here and there and Melissa kept telling her to not fall asleep. Was she nervous about being alone with me?

After maybe two hours Mellisas sitting on the couch w her phone and I sit right next to her for the first time that night. Her friend was passed out. There were many quiet moments but we just talked and she browsed her phone quite a bit but we never went 30 seconds without talking. 

Despite Mellissa having a boyfriend I feel like she wanted me for something. Was it the weed, or for me? Why did she not want her friend to sleep?

Was I supposed to make a move?

I'm confused pls help, thank you."
relationship_advice,Why am I jealous my boyfriend of 2 years’ ex wife and him are a part of the mile high club?,"I don’t know why this bothers me! They were together for a few years. She cheated on him several times (while he was gone to basic training) so he demanded a divorce. She was a horrible SO. Hardly never had sex with him, only 2 blow jobs ever, would call him a dog for trying to initiate anything with him. And she’s downright crazy. People have literally harassed her on the internet for being such a horrible person. Everyone we know has said she’s a terrible human being as well. I even had to threaten legal action for her to stop messaging me on social media. She spread horrible rumors about him and tried to completely ruin his life. And I am confident that I am better physically/sexually than this woman...

Anyways, during a game of never have I ever, he said he had sex with her on a plane and for some reason that bothers me! 

I guess I wonder why he wouldn’t wanna take that kind of fun risk with me? Or why he would have sex with her on a plane when she downright sucks (and sucked for almost the entirety of their relationship)? And honestly, I’m jealous! Everything about it irks me. I want to do fun things like that with him but he said it’s too scary because he could get in trouble with the military. Then why did he do it with her? He even said he didn’t have fun because he was so scared about getting caught the whole time. But it still drives me nuts.

We have a great sex life. He has told me without me asking so many times that I have given him the best head and the best sex he’s ever had. So that makes me feel good and I do believe him. We are very so much infatuated with each other physically. 

How do I rationalize this to make myself feel better? I know it’s ridiculous but maybe someone can provide some insight from the outside. It would make me feel better for someone to tell me this is absurd. I love him very much and I hate how much I sound like a teenage girl right now. I just want that visual out of my head."
relationship_advice,I hit my ex boyfriend and feel awful about myself. I feel like someone who I’m not.,"In no way am I justifying my behavior. I know it was wrong.

I dated this man on and off for a year and a half. I really liked him and I felt like I was a really good girlfriend in the beginning. He was broke so I’ve helped him out with rent. The majority of the time we went out I would buy. He needed a place to stay for a while so he lived with me. 

We got into a lot of arguments anytime I would bring up a concern. I felt like my feelings were being constantly dismissed but he just called me crazy and too emotional. He cheated on me and got upset when I told him I didn’t want to keep the relationship going. There are just so many things that I now see showed he had no respect for me and obviously didn’t “love” me like he would say he did. I was constantly belittled about what I do for work. How I drive how and what I speak about. He got jealous when I would hang out with my coworkers. Accused me of cheating on him with men at my gym. Withheld affection and sex when he was upset and would break up with me anytime he didn’t want to deal with me. It was a constant battle. Made fun of me because I break out. Tell me I turned him off when I opened my mouth. When he was angry. The list goes on. 

It’s hard to me to say why I stayed with him for so long and endured all this because when I met him he seemed so charismatic, polite, a gentlemen, caring, composed. We broke up recently because I’ve developed way too much resentment and therapy has helped me realize a lot. 

The problem is towards the end of this relationship I started hitting him when we would drink usually after he would start insulting me. I would block his number and he would reach out via email a few weeks later. The last thing that happened was I was pretty sad and started crying and he pulled down his pants and told me to give him a blowjob. This took me back and I realized that he would do this when I was upset in the past. One time he had sex with me when I was crying and said it would make me feel better. I try not to think of it because it felt wrong and haven’t told my therapist about this. I didn’t want to admit it to myself for the longest. I’m not going back to this person I’ve blocked his email and number. The issue is I feel like I’m this toxic person now. I could have walked away a long time ago but instead I stayed and built up all this resentment and started being the abuser. I feel that if I could be this angry and hit this person what makes me any better than him? I feel that I can no longer trust myself. I need some advice on what to do if anyone has gotten to this point.

Thanks"
relationship_advice,My (18f) boyfriend (18m) is not a morning person at all and holds me responsible for getting him up in the morning.,"I’m very frustrated because I feel pressured to get my boyfriend up for school, work, etc. I have to stop what I am doing or put off what I am wanting to do in order to do this. Sometimes it takes upwards to hours to get him up.

I understand that everyone is different, and I’m not expecting him to magically become a morning person like I am, but I’m tired of spending hours that could be spent doing other things waking him up, and on top of that, he gets cranky with me while I’m waking him up, and if he doesn’t wake up in time for school, he says, “Don’t let me sleep through school, I need to go to school.” And I’m at a loss. How can he expect me to sit there all day trying to wake him? Eventually I just give up because I don’t know what else to do. 

He doesn’t hear any alarms when they go off. I am as nice as possible when I wake him up, saying “Hey, baby, it’s (time). You should really get up and get ready for (work, school). I don’t want you to be late.” and then I shake him lightly. I’ll even make breakfast for him. 

I know that he’s on his PS4 until very late at night and I’ve suggested going to bed earlier, but then he feels like he has no freetime. 

I understand how he feels, truly. I just want him to be successful and for me to not feel so stressed about waking him up. It’s easier for me because I can run off of not a lot of sleep. He says coffee doesn’t work for him. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
relationship_advice,How do I make him put in more effort?,"He used to try more before we were official. We have been together 3 months or so, and it is starting to dissipate. I don’t know if I’m just too needy or not. We only see each other on one weekday a week these days. When we don’t see each other, he hardly texts me. He used to text me/message me on all platforms all the time. He loves his independence, but he is on his phone a lot.

I know he cares about me, but it doesn’t feel like he really tries that much anymore. Also, he used to always drive to my place— but now it’s usually me driving to his. How do I get him to try more? It almost makes me wish the attention I got when I was single."
relationship_advice,I want to break up with my bf after i set a deadline and he didnt keep it,"Ok I know this sounds bad, but let me explain.

My partner (m25) and I (25f) used to be long distance for 2 years and then he moved country within europe to live with me.

Well hes been living here for 2 years now and in that time he had jobs for a total of 8 months in 4 different companies. At first I believed him that it was a language and cultural barrier but seeing as he spent all day playing games and i always had to sit next to him for him to write applications i dont believe that anymore. I worked a gruelling job that completely wrecked me emotionally and physically to sustain our life and after a few months of him being unemployed and making no effort to go out and get better at the language we had several long talks at the end of which he at least started picking up housework. By that point I was so burnt out i could barely function.

By August i switched to a job that wasnt as painful and my partner also managed to get a job again. 1 month later he tells me he fucked up at work and broke sth expensive, surprisingly he wasnt fired but a week later he came home with pain in his hand, the doctor said he had tendonitis, he called in sick for 2 weeks and afterwards (against mine or the doctors advise) went back to work and was fired on the spot. Now hes home again since November.

So in early January he apparently failed to transfer his part of the rent, and hadnt even told me, which landed me an upset call from the landlord WHILE I WAS AT WORK and i flipped. I told him that if he didnt find a job by January 31st id be gone. I know i was cruel and reacted too harsh but I was terrified after the call and flipped out. He works in a field that is desperately wanted here and theres plenty of jobs in the area, and even if he didnt want that he could go to a hiring company and theyd find sth for him! My salary is not enough to pay for the full rent, and groceries and he knows that.

Anyway today I came home from work and he was in bed lamenting all about how he fainted while getting shots so he needs to go to the doctor first thing monday morning. He didnt adress the deadline at all. I know that if i dont adress it he will never do it and the relationship could continue on like nothing ever happened.

The only thing he told me about is that he went to a hiring agency that immediately offered him a job last monday but i dont know if he ever replied to that. He is a great person aside from the whole job thing and deeply care about him but i want to tell him its over and he needs to sleep in a different room for the time being so that theres real physical consequences to this.

My sister says i am an asshole because he loves me a whole lot, that its not his fault he cant find a job and that i should just forgive him.

But i want to do sth. I dont know how or what but i dont want to live in constant financial terror! 

What do I do?"
relationship_advice,How to ask my gf for some time to tink things through,"23m and 18f, dating for 8 months. 

I’d say we’re in love, and really happy; but I’ve been feeling fairly neglected lately and just feel like I am not a priority for her. 

She just got back from a week long trip and while I was really happy to see her, she sorta dropped a bombshell on me that she’ll be going away in two months to a different country (like 8 timezones away) for 3-4 months. 

I’m obviously shell shocked. I hate long distance and barely made it through this one week, let alone 16. I kinda feel like I wanna break things off, but I want time to think it over so as to not be rash. In the meantime, I can’t be the same with her and don’t want to hurt her feelings. 

How do I explain it to her without arguing or hurting her feelings?"
relationship_advice,Female (16) help with a girl,"So i have a girlfriend and about a month ago I found out that she cheated in me. So it all happened at around our 2 month I saw hickeys in her chest and asked her about it and she said she did it herself, two months later she tells me this girl did it and I never trusted that girl from the beginning. Then recently I didn’t want her talking to this other girl and she promised me she wouldn’t then today someone sent me a video of her talking to the girl I don’t want her too talk to and she denied it until I said I have a video and then she started coming up with excuses, what should I do?"
relationship_advice,Is this a childish thing to get upset over?,"So with me and my girlfriend, we had a bad argument and later breakup. Now thinking back, idk if I was right to get upset over this.

So we were out with friends (all guys) and me and my girlfriend havent been seeing each other irl lately, she started being really touchy and shit to them. Not *that* touchy, like she'd touch there arms, get kinda closer to them, put her head down so they'd touch her head, all this stuff. It really upset me so I asked *politely* if she could stop and she agreed but the week later she did it again. She also would talk about sexual things, and she even started to say stuff about me sexually, like saying sexually degrading things. I told her it hurt me and asked to stop but again she said yeah and did it again. I got really upset over this and just gave out to her (over text message not irl).

Is that stupid to get upset over?"
relationship_advice,My (19f) boyfriend (23m) doesn’t want to move out this summer when that has been the plan for months,"My boyfriend and I currently live with his great grandmother, we take care of her and buy her groceries and all that and in return she lets us stay rent free. However, she is very very old and most likely will pass soon. Also, we both work and I go to school so someone isn’t home with her all the time. Her kids think it would be best to either move her into a home or let her move in with one of her children who could be home with her more often. One of her children has it out for my boyfriend. She is trying to find a way to kick us out soon, this obviously stresses both of us out a ton. We decided we should get a place together ASAP and have been planning on this summer. I finally have a high paying job and honestly, I could afford to live on my own, but it would be way more fun and less expensive to live with my boyfriend. I’ve been saving to furnish the apartment/house and by the end of summer, I could definitely move out. We haven’t talked about it so I assumed this was still the plan and I have been slaving away trying to save up for a place. 

Last night, I brought this up again with him to see where his head was at. He went completely silent and so I continued to talk and finally I said, “Is this something you still want to do? I would be okay to do this even a year and a half from now (so next summer) but I really want to get serious about saving up for a place.” He said “Yes, but it’s going to be expensive. We’re lucky to be living here rent free.” Which I totally agree with, we ARE lucky. It gave me time to save and for him to save as well. However, we’re already on borrowed time. I said, very calmly and nicely, “My plan is to have a place by the end of summer. I would LOVE to do that with you. However, if it’s something you’re not motivated to do, I’ll look for roommates.” He left the room without saying anything. I followed him and said “I wasn’t trying to upset you but i’m not comfortable feeling like I’ll be without a place to live and have to scramble to come up with something.” He said it was okay and to get ready to go get dinner (were going to a drive through). So, I throw on pajamas and head back out and just say “we’re not going in anywhere right?” and he says “I don’t know, unless you want to find some roommates or something” very passive aggressively. I just kind of laugh and get in the car, trying to let it go. The fight is over now but I’m still pretty bothered. 

Am I in the wrong? Should I plan to move out by the end of the summer, with or without him? Does his behavior seem childish to anyone else?"
relationship_advice,I (30F) want to get back together with my ex husband (34M). Therapy for voyeurism/infidelity?,"I want to preface this by saying, yes I realize I’m an asshole in this post. Completely aware and you can tell me I am one. I get it. 

I was with my ex for 5 years. In that time we lived together, bought a house, and got married. In the beginning (first year and a half) of the relationship I thought I caught him filming up another woman’s skirt of someone we knew. I confronted him about it later and he denied it. The conversation never went any further, I thought maybe I was crazy. I never saw anything happen after this date. Sometimes he would get flirty with other people but this never bothered me. 

Unfortunately before we got married I lost my mom very suddenly right before my wedding. He was there for me. Every step of the way. We planned our wedding. Then the holidays came. Then we tried to get pregnant with no luck and I went into a slump. I got depressed. I didn’t want to be at home. I was lacking the affection and love I needed to get myself through this time. So sadly, and I still struggle to this day, I seeked it somewhere else. I never once strayed outside my relationship. I never had to or wanted to before. 

In order to distance myself I brought up the issue that we initially had the first year. He denied it immediately but I knew what he did in front of me and I persisted. He admitted to what he did and I went off and had an affair. 

After that he tried so hard to have me stay but I was so focused on running away. He said he would do therapy for himself and for us as a couple. During this time he became the husband I wanted. He showed me so much love and affection and communication. He forgave me for what I did. He said he understood why. He accepted me for who I am. As far for what he did he said he’s never done it again. The reason he did it was because he saw something on reddit and that provoked a thought. That was the reason he gave me. 

That last few months I’ve been struggling a lot with how my marriage ended. And how I hurt someone I loved so much. Now 8 months later I took some time to travel alone and have been reflecting on everything that has happened this last year. I regret running away from the relationship. I know he would still be willing to give it a try if I come back. My friends have concerns about the picture taking that occurred in the beginning of the relationship and how can I know that this isn’t an obsession. I’m looking for advice on so many different things. If he has an issue, can therapy be successful? Can we work through the issues we had before? I loved and love him still so much that if we can make it with hard work I think it would all pay off. 

Thank you in advance for any thoughts/comments/experience with similar issues."
relationship_advice,What is a good way I (19m) can ask out my crush (19f) who is a coworker?,"Let me start by saying I understand a lot of people have the opinion of don’t shit where you eat and in some ways I understand that and know of the potential consequences. However I work a part time university job at the campus library so I’m not concerned with ruining my career or job here. 


I’ve had a crush on one of my coworkers for a while now and over the past few weeks we’ve really spent a lot of time together both at work and outside of work. At work she’s either tagged alongside me while we’ve been working or she’s asked me to tag along with her to ""complete a task"", we usually just talk or goof around. There has been some subtle flirting and we’ve had several conversations in the last few days about personal stuff and interests that have lasted for hours at a time. She even had me take a love language quiz with her because I didn’t know what that was. It’s almost like we’ve been seeking one another out at work.


We’ve also hung out outside of work a couple times in the last couple of weeks, going to a concert an hour away (with one of her friends) and to a local sandwich place (with another female coworker). Even today she asked in our work group chat consisting of our other female coworkers, me being the exception as the only guy, if anyone wanted to go see a movie with her. I’m kinda getting the hint she’s interested in me as well and I’m wanting to ask her out on a date soon since I know she’s single and looking for a relationship. 


So what is a good way to ask her out? Is it weird to ask her out at work or should I ask to meet her somewhere outside of work to ask her out? It’s been a while since I’ve done the whole dating thing and I don’t know if I’m looking into this ""flirting"" too much. Thanks everyone! 

TL;DR - have a crush on a female coworker and I think she’s interested in me, how do I proceed with asking her on a date?"
relationship_advice,I believe we moved in too fast and I feel trapped,"Me 21(M) and my S/O(20) moved in together 6 months ago. I originally lived in a city an hour and half away and moved to her. I was kicked out my parents and was staying at my grandparents more miserable than I ever had been before. I started up a trade school this semester in our new city and I absolutely love It, but I feel trapped in this apartment with her. Me and her have been dating for a full year now and after 6 amazing months of distance we thought It’d be a smart idea for me to move to where she is and we be together. Now after 6 months I almost fully regret It. I have lost a lot of ties with my friends back in town and haven’t been able to gain any new friends in this new city. I wake up go to school, go to work and go home, that has turned into my daily routine. I understand many people will say “you were too young in the first place” and I completely understand their thinking on that but no one but her knew the depression and hardship I was going through at my grandparents and I thought anything would be better than this. But now being in this new city I feel trapped. I want to make this very clear as well my S/O has done nothing wrong she’s an amazing person and I have so many feelings of love for her. We argue a decent amount but mainly over boundary issues. I want out of this new city and be with my friends and family again but I also have this commitment with my new education I can’t give up on. I can’t wrap my head around a way of telling her these feelings and me needing to get out of this city without us breaking up if I do end up moving away. In one hand I love her but in the other hand I feel trapped and hate the city I’m in with a passion. If anyone has any helpful words of wisdom I’d love to hear them."

relationship_advice,I think I’m being toxic in my relationship,"I’m a 17F and I’ve been with my bf 19M for 6 months. Our relationship is good and all but sometimes I notice that I cross the line. When his vibe is off I get really irritated and think like ”whatever everyone does what they want” which I also think if he does something that’s not even worth getting upset over. For an instance, if he gives a short reply or something like that, I get irritated and act coId and don’t even wanna talk to him?? I know that boys don’t think like us girls and they don’t see things the way we do but I still have high expectations a lot of times. It’s not always supposed to be great and lovey dovey, I know that. I feel like me expecting someone to be a certain way instead of accepting and loving them for who they are is disrespectful and unfair. I’ve also noticed that I’m codependent. Yesterday I was ignoring him after he apologized and explained himself for doing something that semi upset me. Sure, he has his flaws and I might not agree with some of his actions but he’s still human. I also check who he follows though I don’t question him (I did it once and it was a mistake).  I really love this guy and I don’t wanna mess this up, I want to change and stop this behavior. What do I do?"

relationship_advice,"Am I [22F] in the wrong for teasing the man I am dating [28M] about Brexit, then apologizing?","I am an American living in the UK. I am dating a sweet guy, who I want to be his gf. He winds me up alot, just for fun and I know he isnt being serious, though I fall for it sometimes. Today the UK ""left"" the EU. I poked fun at him saying happy Brexit day.

When he got home from work he got upset at me for saying that, listing all of the things that will happen when brexit occurs. I was not at all poking fun at the negatives Brexit will create. Rather, I was teasing him about Brexit as the concept, as its been non stop in the news and in my european politics classes in the USA since 2016. In no way did I mean to joke about the terrible consequences of Brexit. He jokes to me that we ""colonists"" threw tea in the harbor and such, so i thought a Brexit day joke was similar.

I can tell hes upset with me. I wholeheartedly apologised to him, telling him I in no way was trying to make fun of the bad things, just the concept as I explained. Hes not acknowledged my apology, moving on to other things, listing more negatives of Brexit. I feel bad, but also a bit irritated as he jokes with me but when I joke, it is a horrible one. Maybe I am out of line. Am I? I wont get on my knees and apologise to him via text, I have made the best apology possible."
relationship_advice,Said she felt uncomfortable,"So my girlfriend cheated on me 8 months ago. she went to some guys house and within 5 mins they started kissing (she said he made first move). He then said to her “I’ll meet you in the bedroom” so my gf goes to the toilet then gets in bed with this guy (he has condom on already) she says he told her to touch him so she gave him a handy for a minute apparently.
She then says she took her trousers off (didn’t say he told her to) and he grabbed her and put her on top of him. She said he kissed her for about a minute then he pulled out and switched to doggystyle.she said she felt really uncomfortable about even being there never mind kissing or having sex she said she faked it and just wanted it over with and she “just let it happen.
My reply was why have sex with someone when you feel uncomfortable and feel bad. Weirdest part of the whole story is she says she never touched him without him having a condom and through the whole process he never touched her skin to skin. She also said the kissing was not even passionate. Do you think I’m being lied to and she wanted it? She seems like she’s totally downplaying her involvement and minimising every detail."

relationship_advice,Was it my fault for losing my best friend?,"So i'm a male and i've been best friends with this amazing girl for 1.5 years. I met her in college and we really got along. She trusted me so much and always would talk to me about stuff and advices from normal advices to ones with her boyfriend. Now i have to confess something that i haven't told her, i'm in love with her. Yes i've been in love with her for 1.5 years but she doesn't know that. And no i never ever thought about dating her or trying to get rid of her bf, he's a nice guy and they deserve each other. The problem is that i am a bit of an unsecure person when it comes to love. I have had depression for a long time because of that even though i'm only 19. I know it's stupid but that's me. Anw, she practicly saved me without knowing it but over time i started depressing again and again, at firt she would comfort me and get back to normal. But time after time i have started anoying her, and i started geting jealous of this other girl who she was starting to get close to. We talked about this many times but i just couldn't get the idea of losing her out of my head. It scared me shitless and i finally had annoyed her enough until i lost her a few weeks ago. Ever since then i've been trying to fix things with her but she wouldn't even talk to me or look at me, like she hated me or was disgusted with me. Until finally today i got to call her but she ended up getting angry with me and she threatned me if i ever talk to her again she would get her dad to talk to me. I know it sounds weird but she's a good person, and i know she wouldn't have said that if she wasn't hurt by me. But i still dont know if its my fault or hers or no one..."
relationship_advice,Distance relationship advice?,"(20M) So I met this girl on tinder and I feel like I fell in love with her when I first seen her, we matched on tinder and then she gave me her Snapchat and we’ve been chatting on there and she’s been flirtatious with me and even puts x at the end of a few of her messages to me, I told her where I live and she said she was going to be going there in the next couple of months and she said she would like to have a few drinks with me when she visits, she is sexual with me and has even sent me nudes,  she posted on her story that she wanted a loan so I messaged her and said I could give her the money she needed and she wouldn’t have to pay me back (because I’m apparently in love with her now even though we’ve never met irl) she thanked me and sent a very nice message after I gave her the money which made me feel loved back.

The only problem with meeting her irl is that I’m extremely awkward and have bad anxiety and depression and I’m not confident in the way my face and body looks at the moment and I just don’t want to waste her time and disappoint her, what should I do?"
relationship_advice,"My parents (50s), in my opinion, have my sister far too involved with sports at 8 years old, how to tell them?","My sister is 8, I’m 25. She currently plays basketball, softball, and has started volleyball lessons. She has practice 2-3 days a week along with games from multiple sports 2-3 days a week. She’s already involved with a travel ball softball and basketball team. 

I don’t know what’s gotten into my parents, sometimes, they act like my sister is playing in the world championship. In their tournament game this past weekend, the final score was 6-5. 

They are not hard on her when it comes to sports and they’re super supportive. For reference, I  played 3 sports all the way growing up too (now 25). I started in 3rd with travel wrestling every weekend and I got burnt out and quit in middle school. I restarted in high school, but I feel like she doesn’t have any time to be a kid. I don’t want her to burnout. It just seems like a lot for an 8 year old. I don’t believe she feels pressured and she loves them, but that just seems excessive. The problem is that she’s already much better than every other girl her age. It’s not even close, which is part of the reason they’re so intent on her playing so much. 


How do I tell them I feel like they’re doing too much? I know they will he upset with me, but are my concerns valid?"
relationship_advice,How do I (27m) politely tell my friend (28m) that I don’t give a flying f~~k about his coworkers?,"One of my greatest friends (we’ll call him D) since high school has been isolating himself for over a year now.  He struggles with depression and alcohol abuse.  Basically doesn’t leave the house except for work.  He also doesn’t hang out with me anymore unless I drive to his house which is an hour away... 

But he does text me, nearly every day.  I enjoy texting my friends, this doesn’t necessarily bother me.  But D has been blowing up my phone for the past few months about his coworkers.  I have never met these people... I can only remember two of them by name, so half the time I can’t even follow the stories because I don’t know who the hell these people are.

It’s not uncommon for us to talk about things that bother us at work, but now he’s talking about the goings on of these individuals even when it has nothing to do with him.  

We’re talking paragraph after paragraph of text messages...   I guess it’s a combination of D’s drunkenness and boredom or something but I need to figure out how to tell him that I am not the right person to be talking to about this without hurting his feelings...  He already treats me as his text message psychologist (which I also am not qualified for, nor do I care to be).  At this point I feel like his texts have devolved into sympathy stunts or something where he’s not even looking for advice, he just wants sympathy and my compassion has been EXHAUSTED.

TLDR: One of my best friends has decided that I am his text message psychologist and has been blowing up my phone with personal matters at his job that involve people whom I have NEVER MET and don’t care to hear about.  Help me find the words to tell him that I don’t care and I can’t be his text message psych without hurting his feelings! 

Please and thank you ❤️"
relationship_advice,My (29M) Wife (30F) tried to leave during peak financial crisis rather than get a job.,"Hey everyone,

I'm struggling right now trying to figure out what to do. So a bit of background I'm in an industry that has me gone for a few weeks at a time or I'm gone for long hours. This has always put a strain on our relationship as she wants me home more, she hasn't ever really worked in our relationship besides a part time job here and there. I've always told her I want her to work and contribute to our future but magically every time health issues would crop up that meant she called in sick resulting in hours being cut back until she was let go. We have a toddler but she is now old enough to go into daycare which regardless I think she needs as her social interactions outside of us is severely limited. (When she was pregnant and the first 18 months of our child I didn't expect her to work).

I've previously told her in lieu of working her role is to keep the house clean (didn't have to be spotless but decent) and to do everything she can to save us money to offset the lack of a second income. However she is TERRIBLE but money as an example she has spent 700 in a month on fast food on top of 1200 in food expenses (most of that ended up going bad and getting tossed) plus random purchases etc.

Due to financial reasons I simply can't work a more standard job and still cover our base expenses unless she also works.

Okay on to the current problem (sorry about the long background).
I was laid off of my job in October of last year, it took me a month to find something else and that job turned out to be terrible (wages promised and in writing were not what I got) at the beginning of this year I told her that unless she got a job we could lose the house. A week later she told me she needed a break from me and was going to live with her parents for a while. She said I'm a bad husband because I don't pay enough attention to her but I am a good father (so that's something). A couple days before she left extreme weather set in and my family told me to do everything I could to keep her from taking my daughter (going as far as offering to fly up take my daughter and fly to my wife's destination so she would be safe). My wife got mad and said ""so it's okay if I die?"" All I could say was ""it's your decision to leave not our daughters"".

We had a big argument were I told her I've never been so hurt by someone before, that when I begged for help she chose to leave etc etc. She decided to stay for 6 months and if she isn't happy she will leave me. I told her if she stays she has to get a job and has to start taking care of herself.

Now though everytime I look at her I just see someone who would rather leave me at a time when I needed her the most and I'm not sure I can get over that.

Tl;dr financial crisis nearly lost house, begged wife to get a job. She would have left me had it not been for extreme weather. Now all I can see is the betrayal."

relationship_advice,Am I(24f) a terrible person for being turned off by my boyfriend(24m)?,"I had my bf in the beginning that smoking was a NO for me and I thought he didn't smoke. He does I guess social smoke but I had NO idea he did this until like a month into dating, which make problems arise for me, but I didn't say anything because this was a new relationship.

Fast forward to a year and a few months later. I never thought it would be a huge problem because he didn't have the opportunity to do it and he said he wouldn't do it around me so I thought we were fine, but he ended up doing it around me recently and that was when I had enough.

I was honest with him and told him that it turns me off and that I can't stand the fact that he even chose to do it and not tell me the truth in the beginning. I also was angry with him because he said he would never do it in front of me and yet he did it anyway, which felt like disrespect. 

He ended up deciding to stop doing it all together and I appreciate it. I just don't want to be looked at like I am some sort of controlling asshole. I didn't sign up for a relationship with someone who smokes, if I knew I wouldn't have gotten into it. 

I just want to emphasize that because I would never start dating someone who does something I dislike, but then try to change them. I was completely unaware about it."
relationship_advice,Is my ex into me?,[removed]
relationship_advice,"I want to make friends, but they don't seem to care about me too much and I feel alone","I (M19) moved to a new country for my studies a few months ago, and I'm now all alone. I still keep in touch with my friends from back home, but the distance makes things difficult and I just need some friends near me to include me in things. I simply want to feel like someone near me cares enough about having me around to be willing to hang out once in a while. I have made maybe 2 or 3 friends at school, but we very rarely actually hang out with each other or organize anything together, our relationship boils down to us having fun chats when we happen to run into each other. I am fun to them, so they tell me, but no effort is made to hang out or have fun together, in essence, to stay friends. I've met their friends and they tell me that I'm a fun person to hang out with, but I don't get invited to anything, they don't seem to care about maintaining contact. I've been trying to make friends the old fashioned way as well, by going out to a bar or attending a concert or something, and I do meet people, and they do remark that I'm very fun to talk to. I've been told that I have this ""aura of positivity"", but these connections I've made with people disappear shortly after. People rarely maintain contact, and the fun people I meet end up just moving on with their lives regardless of me. I feel like I'm destined to be the really fun encounter these people have and then they forget about and just move along, forgetting completely about me. This confuses me and makes me feel honestly kind of depressed, despite my charismatic and positive demeanor. 

  
In short, I don't seem to meet anybody that minds me not being around, even though I have been told by multiple people that I am a really fun person. I can't seem to make friends that want to stay friends, practically every relationship I have is casual and means practically nothing to them, or at least it seems that way. It bums me out, I need advice."
relationship_advice,Should I(20F) tell my friend(20F) that I have romantic feelings for her?,"My friend and I met at the beginning of our first year in college and we've known each other for a year and a half now. Of that time spent together, I've liked her for about a year. I have it pretty bad for her. While we're in the same group of friends, we also hang out a lot alone together, which usually consists of going out to eat and then watching TV or just talking.

So, I had doomed myself to a life of wallowing in unrequited love because this particular friend of mine is ""married to her work"" and seemingly doesn't have any interest in dating (or me romantically). I had convinced myself that it'd never happen so I wouldn't even try. However, I feel like me liking her has given me kind of a mental barrier that makes it so I don't want to date others. So, the answer I came up with to avoid this problem was to just straight up tell her how I feel, because even if she rejected me I could move on without regret.

Here are a few things that might make this not such a good idea:

1. The gay thing: we have talked about this before (in an unrelated context) and I really don't know. She has said things that could suggest being interest in girls, but could just as easily not be. All of our mutual friends think she's at least bi, but I don't know if I've ever heard this from her directly. She doesn't really talk about her sexuality at all (same goes for me I guess though. People generally don't know I'm gay unless I tell them).
2. The timing: she seems to be going through a time where's she's not feeling to well emotionally and is having trouble with confidence among other things. I don't know if me saying I like her will flatter her or just stress her out even more. The last thing I want to do is increase her stress.
3. I'm a coward: I don't know what I'll do if our relationship changes. The major thing that's stopping me is that I'm afraid if I tell her and she doesn't feel the same, a rift might form between us. She wouldn't do it consciously (she's the most genuinely kind person I know), but the thought of that driving her away makes me really sad. I'd rather stay close to her and say nothing than tell her and drift apart. She's one of my closest friends and I don't want to lose her.

I've talked to a few friends about this, and have gotten some mixed reviews. A few friends have said that they ""see it"", but I know I should take that with a grain of salt because, after all, they're my friends. There's also the fact that I've never been in a relationship before since I'm kind of a late bloomer, so I don't know how any of that works out. So, with everything I've said above, should I go for it? Also, from people with more experience than me, is there any good way I should go about it?

TL;DR: Should I tell my friend about my romantic feelings for her so that they can be resolved?"
relationship_advice,25f insecure about number of sexual partners,"So I've slept with three people since being sexual active and that includes my 27 year old boyfriend. I don't know how many he has slept with because it doesn't matter to me enough to ask but I know it's more than me considering he's been single for 10years prior to is dating 6mos ago. 
For some reason I feel insecure about my number. I mean I've had plenty hook ups without going all the way. The first person I slept with I dated for 5 years, the second was a one night stand. Idk I guess it makes me feel like I'm naive or too much of a goody goody. :/ 

Is there any advice you can give me to not feel so insecure?"
relationship_advice,How do I tell my friend I dont want to go out to the bars with her because she's having relationship troubles?,"I [22F] invited my friend [21F] to go out to the bars tonight to have a good time. I'm not going to go into too much detail but she said she'd need a place to crash if that's the case. Her boyfriend lives a couple blocks away. This really brought me to regret inviting her because the last few times we went out for drinks she ended up complaining the whole night and crying to me personally, when all I want to do it go out for fun.

I love my best friend and I want her to feel better, but last time we went out she said shes ""having a hard time lately"" I said she's always having a hard time, and last time we went out as a group she dominated the conversations with complaints about various things, and even my boyfriend pointed it out to me later on. It gets exhausting.

I just feel that every time her and I are together she complains, then alcohol brings to crying and all I want to do is go out for a few drinks and have a good time. Not console her all night.

So how do I back out of this or steer the night where I'm not a personal therapist?"
relationship_advice,My (24F) boyfriend (26m) chickened out on moving in with me again.,"I am going to start with a little context.  My now boyfriend and I met through work.  He was interested in me, but ending up dating another girl.  She wasn't very affectionate at all and let her narcissistic sister dictate her life.  They were engaged for 2 years and lived together for most of the total 3 years they were together.  They broke up when her sister invited herself to an anime convention that she initially wasn't interested in at all.  I'm going to go ahead and add that he had Asperger's and takes medication for anxiety. 

On my end, I dated a male coworker who I'm pretty sure only wanted sex from me.  He then started dating a God awful woman who first bullied me, then flirted with me.  I was also raised by a narcissistic mother, so I have my own trust issues and undiagnosed mental health issues. 

I like to think that we have a happy relationship.  We are able to be open with each other.  He does get annoyed with my insecurities and I do tend to have knee jerk reactions to stuff.

Regardless of whether or not it's with him, I'm going to finally move out of my mother's house.  I need to get away from her.  Relatively early in our relationship(we have been together for almost 8 months), I asked him if he was okay with getting an apartment together.  He said he was, then shortly thereafter, he said he had a panic attack and wanted to rethink it. 

A couple of weeks ago, he asked me if I wanted to move in with him.  I happily said yes.  Yesterday, he said he won't qualify for insurance from his employer until mid July but my landlord said that my lease is up at the end of July.  So we both thought we could make it work. 

This morning, he told me that he has to stay with his mother for now.  When I asked him why, he said he has to.  He told me yesterday that his mom would refuse to help him with making sure he gets his anxiety meds if he moved out.  He insists that he loves me and is happy with our relationship.

I talked to my dad for advice, and he seems to think that we both have time to work things out.  Before anyone gives any suggestions, neither of us drive, and on top of apartment prices being inflated thanks to a major college in the area, our town has shitty public transportation.  I do have my permit, but while I'm trying to find a driving school, my mom is refusing to help me learn.

Tl;dr, my boyfriend is probably scared of living with me, but insists that everything between us is fine."
relationship_advice,"Dating a girl for 2 Months, she took a changed her pill and it ruined everything, try again or leave?","So me and this girl began talking an dwe immediatly clicked, we like the same things, the same music, the same movies, we have simmilar humour, personality, characteristics, everytime we talk we can do it for hours and its always a good time, we just both fell for each other and it was all just to good to be try. We had few 1 day dates and it all went well, then we deicded that she comes over for the weekend and then everything got kinda ""ruined"".   

a week before she was at her gynecologist and since she hadnt had her period for few months and she took her pill very weirdly, the gynecologist prescribed her a new pill which she then took after. (She didnt tell me any off this beforehand) So the Stayover the weekend comes and because of the changed pill and she having her period(which i didnt knew) she begins to act very distanced and weird, no emotion, realy negative, no body contact, she doesnt want to do anything, so these 3 days were realllly shitty and i began thinking if i realy want this, if i should just ""break up"" and i tried to do everything i could to get her into a better mood, even asked her what is going on but she didnt answer, it didnt work so i just began to do my own thing and distance myself aswell. She had night shift after the weekend so we didnt write until 2 days after, and then i asked her why she acted like that, my interest already going low, but then she explains everything and we begin to text normally, until few days later she tells me that because i was distanced aswell she also rethought everything, because it seemd like i didnt care and she kinda lost her crush on me.  

I dont know what to do anymore, since she changed her pill se behaves different and it just ruined everything.. i realy like her and i probably will never meet a girl like her again.  

What should i do now? do i try to get her interest back? do i show that im still intrested? or do i just leave it since its only 2 months and already such a hasslee, but the thing is its not because of us but because of the pill, man idk what to do ..."
relationship_advice,Those who don’t know how to hold a conversation,"How do y’all deal with dates that just don’t understand how to hold a conversation that’s deeper? Or even one that just basic everyday talk?

She never asks any questions, and when I ask deeper questions I always get one sentence basic answers. When we go out it’s literally her just complaining about her co-workers and she never tries to engage in meaningful conversation after four dates.

I know its stupid but I feel like he's more sexually attracted to his OC than to me.

relationship_advice,Do you ever just stare at your partner in admiration?,"I have a bad habit of LOVING looking at my partner. Admiring their face, attributes, expressions, everything. It fills me with a warm, connected, happy feeling. They, on the other hand, understandably seem to find it annoying, asking me what I am looking at or telling me to stop. I usually only do this when we're lying in bed together, or when we're out dancing and they're so happy, I love the expressions they wear, and they make me feel happy as well. 

Since they don't seem to like it, I've cut back on it and tried to stop it altogether, but it makes me feel sad that I can't do that anymore. They don't understand why I like looking at them even though I've tried to explain it, but I thought if you really adored someone watching them was sort of a universal thing? Is it not?

Anyways I worked here for 4 months, and manger and I have only really have said hello and goodbye to each other . I never thought anything I till now due to us always just saying hello\bye . Last week  when he saw me walking by he began to say his usual hello for the day and followed up that he was leaving the store . I answered back and told him that so was I and that I was getting a transfer to another location . Turns out he’s leaving this store to go to the same store I’m re locating. He didn’t know that I was relocating due to him not being my boss. I didn’t say anything about my transfer, turns out we are both from the same town and hence why he’s going to my new location to be closer to home . We go on about our day and I see him again. This time he asks me when I’m leaving and tells me okay he’ll come say bye before he heads on out. When it’s time to clock out he’s waiting for me discretely in the back . I clock out and he walks out of the warehouse with me . He walks me to my car and tells me to get home safe . I’m still in my car warming it up and he drives around and parks right next to me. He asks what day I work next and I tell him I wasn’t completely sure. He tells me he hopes to see me again and that it will be heart breaking if we don’t ever cross paths again. He drives off I go home . Two days later I have work again. Which was today . I saw him again and he very talkative. He would make it seem like he had to go to the back room but it would be just to talk to me  . The day goes bye and I see him when I’m clocking out . Today was his last day in this warehouse, yet he doesn’t know he will be seeing me at his new location. I didn’t want to tell him that I had a transfer because I felt like it would be a little weird since I feel like he likes me but I can’t tells. He tells me that he will miss me and asks where my full time job is , (he knew this warehouse job was part time job for me)I tell him where and he explains how he wants to come see him one day . We say our goodbyes . And he pulls me hand to say that he will come visit me . What’s weird is that he never asked for my number despite of all of this . My coworker has seen the change in him and says she thinks he is married and that why he never asked for my number . What do you guys think ?"

She has really bad anxiety and I kind of have trouble talking about difficult things with her because shell freak out and beat herself up. Anyway last time I visited I had accidentally found a box of one of her exs stuff. It bothers me that she has it but I dont know how to address it. Especially since it would have to be over text or a phone call. Besides that she doesnt post pictures of us on social media which I generally wouldnt care about but she still keeps pictures of her exs on social media so it hurts a little. Especially since I've addressed it and she said that shes afraid of what people would say or think. I just dont know how to handle this situation but I'm hurting and dont want to hurt her.

relationship_advice,"My dad (64M) and his creepy harem (18F, 18F)","So yeah, this is gross. My dad has always been kinda bad with his relationships with women; he married my mom because she was pregnant with me, and cheated early and often. Eventually I grew up and moved out, and he took off shortly after, considering his duty complete. One of his affair partners, a woman half his age, became wife #2. They stayed together for a few years, and he had his second daughter, my half-sister. She's about 20 years younger than me. 

We weren't super close for a while, mainly because he never apologized for cheating on my mom and then abandoning her, and I never forgave him for it. But things fade with time and we eventually reconnected. He was on wife #4 by then and it seemed like that one might stick. She was his age, had her own career and didn't put up with his crap. I liked her. 

They retired and moved to Guatemala, where it is much easier to live on a social security income. Wife #4 was big into her church and they ran some charitable activities there, did some part time work, and seemed pretty satisfied with retirement. I saw him about 1-2 times a year, when he had to return to the US periodically to keep his residency. Then suddenly I hear he and Wife 4 have split, he's moved into his own place in Guatemala, and he has two ""live in housekeepers"" who are both 18F. According to him, they live with him for free, take care of things, and ""keep him company."" Oh, and one of them is pregnant. 

I feel like any respect I had left for him has vanished. He clearly doesn't care what I think of him though, and isn't going to change. He's just going to keep on being super creepy and taking advantage of these kids. Part of me wants to confront him over this, ask how he would feel if it was my half sister, who is 18, or his granddaughters, who are 16 and 19. Would he want them in that same position? But I don't know what purpose that would serve, it's not going to change his behavior. At the same time, keeping silent about it feels like tacit acceptance. 

So, the question - what do I do here? Speak up and tell him this is gross, or just drop our remaining contact? We don't have much relationship as it is. Then again, he's the only dad I have and he's had some health issues. I don't know how much time is left for us to have a relationship, or if I want one."
relationship_advice,Me (22M) girlfriend (20) gets angry and frustrated,"So this has been an ongoing issue in our relationship and we have talked about it numerous times. A little back story is, I have been dating my gf for now about a year and half. In the beginning of our relationship it was extremely rocky and toxic but I brushed it off because it was my first relationship. This girl was insanely obsessed with her ex and even slept with him once in the beginning when we were talking, and possibly talked about him everyday for this first 4 months about something to do with him. I was like a therapist almost for her because she didn't have much time to process after they broke up and she got in a relationship with me right after. I didn't know it affect me to the point it has but this semester in school, she has class with him because we got to the same college. But I talked to her about it and how it made me uneasy and she brought up how I don't trust her and everything. But I explained it was because what are foundation was built on that it makes me uneasy. But anyways I just let it be and go on my day because its something I don't want her to drop or leave and have it affect her studies. I just can't stop thinking about is the problem really and most of the time I don't. But moments when I am alone, I start thinking about everything that went in on in our relationship because there was more of course on top of this. I just wanted your guys thoughts and thank you!"
relationship_advice,My (26m) can't not argue with my GF(25) in the mornings and its really affecting how i feel about the relationship.,"We've been together for coming up on three years and i love her so much. The title says it all.

Most weekday mornings we car pool to work and literally cannot have a morning without bickering and fighting. I have been trying my best for the past few weeks to be level headed and to not get baited into engaging in an argument. I've brought up to her that this affects my day at work quite a bit and even at this moment I'm posting from work because i cant focus on anything else. When we discussed this the last time and how it made me feel she told me that this is how it is for most couples. ""People are stressed and bicker in the mornings, thats life"". While i understand that this is probably partially true i cant accept this and would like to make it better. 

Now that I've talked about the problem i would like to say that this is in no way her fault at all. I have a problem taking criticisms in the morning especially when thats the only time we are going to see each other for 8-12 hours (our work hours). I hate having that bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day and it seeps into when i see her even though i love her so incredibly much,

On her side of this issue she wakes up with the absolute minimum time available to her to get ready and is stressed about that. Usually asks me for help getting ready but i need to get ready for work as well. Making food and generally getting ready takes some time. When i can help i do what i can to ease her mornings. 

Im sorry if this is jumbled and all over the place i was just looking for some advice on how to make her understand that this is tainting how i feel about the relationship and that id like to work on it. Thank you"

relationship_advice,Things to expect when moving in with my significant other?,"In a few months, I (23F) will be moving in with my boyfriend (24M) of 1.5 years (we have known each other for 3 years total).

relationship_advice,"Fiancé (26m) is rapidly losing weight without trying, I (28f) am concerned and don’t know what to do anymore.","It started about a year ago when we found out that he likely has an intolerance to gluten. He has refused to see a doctor for this issue to this day - the reason I was able to convince him to try switching to a gluten free diet is because I got him a 23andMe health test and it determined there was a chance he was sensitive to gluten. Previously, he has had stomach issues his entire life and just pushed through it, his parents even told me it’s been happening since he was a little kid. Once we lived together I got really tired of making him sick with my cooking all the time and pleaded for him to go to the doctor. It never happened, it’s now 6 years later, but at least we figured it out and now he is doing much better. 


At first once switching to gluten free he was doing fine. Perhaps he lost a couple pounds and it was barely noticeable, he’s always been a skinny guy. However, in the past 2-3 months he has lost about 20 pounds. He is now 5’11” and 140 pounds, inching closer to underweight each day. He honestly seemed to feel terrible when he mentioned this to me - he knows he has lost the weight really fast and assures me it’s unintentional. He told me this was his middle school weight and he seemed concerned as well.


To try to combat this, I suggested that we start tracking his calories using an app and I would start to cook healthy higher calorie meals. I am of the opinion that he is a grown man and can put his own calories into the app, I will let him know what I use to cook with and he can do the input. I’ve used calorie counting apps to lose and maintain weight for years, so I showed him how to use it. He set a goal weight of 150 (about normal weight for him) and it determined he needs about 2320 calories a day to gain a half pound a week. As long as he is getting up to above 2000 or so, I’m not very concerned. However, he has been really struggling to eat this much. 


I am concerned for his safety and he acts like I’m nagging him when I tell him he needs to eat more to get to his goal each day. He is annoyed when I try to plan out meals the day ahead so we can get him to his goal. He barely gives me suggestions for vegetables he would like in his meals and only will really eat a salad or occasional broccoli. I am concerned about that because nutrient deficiency is a real issue in this situation.


I love this guy with all my heart, I’m planning on marrying him, but I need him to take control of this if he doesn’t want me nagging him about eating more every day. I know the kind of health issues that come along with being underweight, and I don’t want that for him. I don’t know what more I can do for him at this point. I really think seeing a doctor might be beneficial, but in the 6 years we’ve been together he’s only gone maybe once or twice, for the flu and a minor skin surgery. I don’t know where the line is between nagging and trying to help. Please let me know what you think the best way to handle this situation would be, I’m at a loss.

TL;DR: fiancé is undereating, don’t know how to help anymore."
relationship_advice,"I, (16m), hit my girlfriend ,(16f), out of jealousy...","So , I'm basically loosing my mind now, and what better thing to do is other than post my personal problems on the internet , right?
Honestly I don't know if anyone will even mind my kiddie-bullshit or whatever , and I probably shouldn't even post this , but here I go.


I'm in my 10th month of relationship with my girlfriend and lately she's been acting kind of cold to me ( no shit sherlock, I wonder why ). This is also our first ever relationship together...

All in all , we've had a discussion about how she gets beaten at home , and she ended up linking me with that , ""because I am like that too"".

The truth is ... I never ever ever had a solid reason to be jealous over her. I know she loves me with all her heart and she truly cares about me , and she won't ever cheat on my in any kind of way , she's just not that type of girl , I know it.

Anyway , what I'm trying to say is that somehow , I became jealous sometimes throughout my relationship with her , mostly because she started acting really really cold to me from time to time , thus making me paranoid and jealous.
The thing is , every now and then she would say something to make me a little bit jealous , for example last time when I hit her , it went down like this :

I was waiting in front of her apartment building , and I saw her coming towards me , but talking on the phone. When she got close to me , she said goodbye and hung up. I asked her who was she talking to , and she said that it was a friend of hers. I asked her what his/her name was , being curious and slightly uncomfortable by that , and she asked me this ""Do you wanna know his name just so you can kill him ?"" 

Shortly I began shaking and being really really anxious , having that flame inside of me like my worst nightmare came true , and she kept nagging me with that question , making me more and more frustrated.

She then asked me if I was jealous and I said yes , and she started making fun of me, looking at me with weird looks and messing around with me , and then , in that very moment , I softly punched her in the stomach , barely enough to make her just flinch a little. 

I apologised right away , feeling really really guilty , and she said it was okay... 

After that she went upstairs to drop her backpack off , and she came back down , then we hanged out for a while until my bus came.

Since then , including that afternoon , she started being really cold to me. No kisses , no hugs , not even really... wanting to hang out , but she still came out to hang with me when she could.

The thing is that I never ever in my entire life intended to hurt her in any way , shape or form. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me , and I wouldn't know what to do if she wasn't here for me.

Now... It wasn't the first time this has happened , it happened plenty of more other times , every time it happened it was because I was feeling jealous , and never hit her full force. Softly to moderate , and always just once, mostly in the shoulder. I never have done it multiple times because guilt would wash over me , realising what I have just done.

Now she told me that she doesn't want to live with a person who doesn't have self control and hits her , and she said that being hit is okay only if she's hit by one of her family members (mother or older brother in this case , her father figure wasn't present in her life).

She said that she will be cautious to push away anything that hurts her , and she now told me to look for a punching bag somewhere else , she told me she doesn't want me like this , and that she'll maybe write back later because she's grounded now.

She also said that it's my parents fault they let me go to karate classes a long time ago , that now I know how to hit efficiently and be violent... But I never ever even hit her with something I learned there , hell , I never wanted to hurt her in any way...


I don't know what to do... I started crying 2 hours ago and I still can't stop , and I don't know what to do anymore... I wrote her a lot of texts explaining everything , but she hasn't seen them yet...

I'm scared that I just ruined the best thing I ever had in my entire life , the girl who I trust with my whole heart... We even had sex together for the first time earlier in my relationship and if she leaves me , I will be devastated and destroyed beyond healing... She's the best thing I have in my life and my soul would be crushed if she gave up on me...

I'm loosing my mind... I just hope she'll understand that I will never do it again in my entire life , and that I can change it all...

I'm so sorry.... I wish I could take everything back... I wish she will give me another chance to prove her that I am not like this...

I love her more than anything else , and she knows it... But... God... Please help me get through this..."
relationship_advice,Locked up in my feelings,":/

I just found out my boyfriend who I’m in a long distance relationship with is going to jail for a few months. We have been talking for about a year and dating for a couple of months now. I knew about his legal issues when we first started talking but it’s now all hitting me after we got a sentence. It’s not that long of time but it’s still a lot to adjust to.. In my heart I know I have to be strong and get through this with him but in the other hand I have been with someone in jail before and know what it is like trying to maintain a relationship and stay sane in jail. any help with how to be strong for myself and him?"
relationship_advice,I (19f) have been struggling with my boyfriend's (24m) lack of empathy and understanding. What is a way to cope with our personality differences?,"First off, this is not a throwaway account but it's a secondary account I made for the sake of anonymity. 

Second, I'm looking for advice but I am not prepared to break up with my boyfriend despite our differences. I'm looking for alternative solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, so I have been dating my boyfriend for nearly a year. However, we've known each other upwards of two years. All in all I adore him and he's a good guy. We love each other and, at least for the most part, mesh well. With that said, one big difference in our personalities is caused some tension on my side of the relationship. I've always known he wasn't necessarily the affectionate or emotional type, most of that being told to conceal how he feels his entire life. Typically, it doesn't cause issues because, while I enjoy affection, I much prefer companionship than anything. 

Once the first few months of our relationship passed our sex life declined significantly. It went from a few times a week, to about twice a month.  While, initially, it didn't really bother me it slowly has begun to cause a lot of self-doubt in my mind. He often scrolls through Reddit looking at images of other women but he never really looks at or appreciates me in that manner, not outwardly anyway. Also, whenever we end up in the bedroom I spend most of the time sucking him off and get deprived of most sexual or affectionate attention. To a degree I get some, but compared to early in our relationship it's not even close to the same. When it comes to any sort of affection, it's extremely inconsistent. Some days he'll want cuddles, other days he won't even touch me. Often times, with the lack of affection, I'll make a noise similar to humph. However, he ended up telling me that me doing that was a nonverbal ultimatum to take him away from the things he enjoys. While I understand his standpoint, I rarely ask him to stop doing a hobby to spend time with me. When I do ask for quality time, as it's my love language, he often says he doesn't know how to do it. So, I then ask to do certain activities with him but often times he ends up inviting other people to join us. He always invites our friends, but whenever I explain to him that I wanted us to do things one-on-one he acts like I'm trying to control his friendships. It finally crossed the line when he invited one of our mutual friends, whom he's really close to, if he would like to join us on our anniversary trip. I told him no, which he listened to, but the problem of spending time together is still a persistent issue.

Another key event that is fresh in my mind is when we were discussing my abuse, which entailed rape, molestation, beatings, etc. His response was that I needed to let it go. Alright, I get what he means. I need to not let it control me, however the blunt response of me needing to let it go was too much. In addition to my abuse I also consistently struggle with severe pain due to injuries and birth abnormalities. I don't complain about it, but occasionally it'll get bad enough that if I try to walk my muscles will give out resulting in me to fall so I try to limit what I do. He is so inconsistent with his approach to things. He either tries to help me when I'm struggling or just ignores it entirely. I don't want to be a burden so I very rarely ask for things unless I am completely unable to do it myself. This goes for when I'm sick or anything of that nature. However, I do whatever I can to help him when he needs it. There's just a really big double standard in our relationship, whether it goes to spending time together, affection, or assistance. There's also a huge amount of inconsistencies

I could go into more details and key events, but that wont necessarily provide any real insight to the situation, but if you'd like to know more feel free to ask. I just think the real problem is his lack of empathy and understanding. He doesn't think about how other people feel and, in some instances, he doesn't really care. I've talked to him about the reason I don't talk about many of my thoughts and feelings with him, due to my past as well as his lack of empathy, and he says he just doesn't know how to respond to other people's emotions.

I'm just looking for a way to help him understand my point of view, feelings, and thoughts. I know that I will not be able to change him, but I want to know a more effective way of communicating my needs and have him actually receive the information I'm presenting. I feel like if I'm able to ""break through"" that our relationship will be much stronger and many issues will resolve themselves because we're both willing to change for the better."
relationship_advice,Ended a fwb relationship with a coworker because I started having feelings for him. Not sure how to act around him anymore,"So I'm not exactly sure where to begin. I was in a fwb situation for almost a year with kind of a coworker/boss. Kind of a because he works at the other location but visits us a lot. Like maybe 3 4 times a week. Anyway. This relationship was completely wrong in every sense. He's married. (Don't judge please. There's a very long story behind this which wouldn't be a good idea to share). In short his wife doesn't care and there's so many reasons they can't divorce. 

I always liked him as a person. He's almost everything a decent guy should be. Almost. And recently I started getting too attached because we spent almost 2 months seeing each other everyday. At work or just hung out after even without sex sometimes. And ofcourse I started to have feelings for him which could've been okay if it was someone else. I didn't want to tell him so I just told him that we should end it and he didn't say much except that he wouldn't want to but knows it's the right thing to do. So we had one last night/morning together which was so good. He kept asking me the reason I'm ending it in a hurry. I still didn't want to say because it sounded pathetic? Idk. Anyway it ended and I didn't know or don't know how to act or what to do anymore in front of him.

We talked a couple of days later, on the phone just joked and stuff. He asked how I am mentally cause he knew I was attached to him. He was too, a little. Fast forward a couple of more days when we talked at night. I was too emotional and had been crying which he figured out and asked if I had feelings for him. I didn't say yes but I didn't say no either. To which he just said it's natural don't think about it too much and we'll be fine and stuff. He said he'd call me the next day again to ask how I am but he didn't. I came to work the next morning he was there and I just stayed in the car until he left. That was 2 days ago. I feel like texting and asking if he's okay or if he forgot. I know that's stupid please tell me it's stupid."

relationship_advice,How should I (22m) text women after I get the number?,"I get a good amount of numbers/snapchats on dating apps but I don’t know how to text them. After asking a few questions, I usually say something like we should get a drink send me your number so we can set up a time. Here is mine xxx-xxx-xxxx and then usually wait a week to text them if they don’t text me first so I don’t come across as needy. My question is, however, do you start with small talk and then say we should still get a drink when are you free this week, or just start by messaging hey it’s __ we should still get a drink when are you free this week? I always here different advice like never set up the date on the initial text, talk with her a little and set up the date the next day making her wonder why you didn’t ask, then I here only text to set up the date, small talk and make her invest a little before setting up the date. I’m just really confused and don’t know how to text. Thanks."

relationship_advice,Ex says she won’t get back with me unless I date other people first,"So to make a long story somewhat short, My ex and I had dated for 5.5 years. I wasn’t the best of boyfriends and made her feel insecure and unloved and 4.5 years into it she had an emotional affair with someone. She really made steps foward to proving that she regretted her decision and we were working things out. The pain and anger was just uncontrollable for me and I yelled at her constantly rather than using a different outlet to get rid of my anger. Well last month she reached her breaking point and said she can’t handle being yelled at and she hasn’t forgiven herself for what she did and thinks I’d be better off with someone else so we ended things. I’m realizing now more than ever that the only thing I want is her and to make things right between us. She doesn’t think I’ve changed and says she doesn’t want to just accept my apologies and run back to me. I’ve made some serious lifestyle changes and have done everything I can to seriously change myself and be the best boyfriend I can be, but she doesn’t believe me. I know my apologies sound like every other time but this time I’m seriously committed to treating her the way she deserves to be. But she wants me to be with other people so that I can “be absolutely sure” that she’s the one I want. I’m stuck and I just don’t know where I should go from here."
relationship_advice,How can I improve my relationship with my niece?,"I am a 35-year-old woman and I require some advice regarding my niece's (16F) behavior. My niece (brother's daughter) lives in a relatively small town - the kind where almost everyone knows everyone else. Her parents and the people around her believe that she is the most beautiful girl in town and do their best to flatter her about her looks instead of encouraging her to do well in high school or in her tennis classes. Her mother believes she has the potential to be a tennis champion and an oscar-winning actress too (I'm not exaggerating). She paid me a visit during the Christmas vacation. Her mother (my sister in law) was with her as well.

Throughout the week, my sister in law narrated boring tales about how difficult life is for a mother of a beautiful girl. She has to be protected from the predators (boys) in school and suspicious relatives who might abuse her. I was so bored that I challenged my niece to a game of tennis instead. Her mother warned me that I was going to get wallopped. Surprisingly, my niece turned out to be quite an average badminton player and received a thrashing instead of giving me one. She failed to win a single game despite the fact that I am beyond my peak fitness levels. She shook my hands at the net and puckered her lips to give me a kiss on the cheek when her mother arrived.

I was stunned to notice that she withdrew her hand immediately from mine and ran to her mother. Her mother was furious to know that she had lost and might have even hit her had I not intervened. The girl kept telling her mother that she had sprained her foot in the first game, although I am certain that nothing of that sort happened. She spent the entire day locked up in her room. When she ran into me in the dining space, she said ""sorry"" and went back to her room again. I have no idea what is wrong with her. Is it not my duty to ensure her well-being? Why did she not admit defeat when she lost fair and square? Maybe her mother keeps telling her I am a bad person. What can I do to improve our relationship?

TL;DR: My niece behaved quite badly after a tennis match with me. I did not gloat over my victory or hurt her feelings. Why did she not admit defeat graciously? How can I help her if she is feeling upset about something?"
relationship_advice,I (34m) broke up with my live in gf (25f) after an epiphany from listening to music.,"It is more complicated than the title suggests but that is basically the gist of it. We moved in together about a year ago and just separated for good yesterday. Things have been hard since basically the beginning. She has been very controlling, and it caused me to isolate myself from my friends and family. Lately my Brother in Law must have suspected I wasn’t doing well, and without reason has been sending me songs to listen to. So the purpose of this post is to share the specific songs, and the lyrics that helped me stand firm and say that I have had enough.
1: [In Tall Buildings by John Hartford, preformed by Max Gomez ](https://youtu.be/vEzaVUwEBiU)  The specific lyrics that spoke to me are Goodbye to the sunshine, good bye to the dew, goodbye to the flowers and goodbye to you. Basically I felt like the sunshine had left my life, and I asked myself if I was ok with it. I wasn’t.
2: [Don’t let the sun go down on your grievances by Daniel Johnston](https://youtu.be/C6ZiZmQ5V2s) Do yourself a favor, be your own savior, don’t let the sun go down on your grievances.
I hope these help those who are looking for the strength to stand up and change a situation they are clearly ready to change.

relationship_advice,Colleagues keep sexually teasing me (19F) about other colleague (32M),"TLDR: older colleagues have been constantly bringing up other male colleague to me, always asking me to consider him as he has many good aspects, to the point where they make sick jokes of me and him kissing or doing lewd things. not sure if it’s an indication that he finds me attractive and thus told my colleagues about it, which led to their matchmaking. personally, i feel that this has gone too far.


I’ve been a marketing intern at a ophthalmic company since September 2019, my colleagues are all very friendly and loving. They pamper me a lot as i’m physically the smallest and also the youngest. I’ve been called cute and pretty by them many times.

Recently in Dec, a financial analyst joined, let’s name him M. I’ve never really spoken to M often as we are from two different departments even though our seats are right behind each other. Last week was my last week as their intern as they are hiring me on contract in the financial department, meaning I’ll have to sit beside M and work with him. However, about 3 weeks back, my marketing colleagues have been constantly shoving M’s name into my face when we go out to eat, even making sick jokes about me sitting on his lap when I get hired as a contract staff and that I should consider him. He’s actually pretty wealthy and is single. 

At first I thought it was a joke, so I brushed it off, but my friend and I realised that they kept on talking about M to me, as if they really wanted me to consider him, even to the extent of playing a game where they didn’t want to let me end it until I chose to marry M. I then realised that he actually stares at me very often, and would often just steal glances at me every day. To make matters worse, I found out from some of my colleagues in operations today that rumours have been going around that I like M. How could that happen when I wasn’t the one who asked about him, talked about him. I never once mentioned him to any of my colleagues. 

But all of a sudden they want to match make us, and now people are gossiping that I like him? Do you have any reasons as to what’s going on? Colleagues in operations have also been pushing me “What if he likes you? Would you consider him?” I’m very lost as to what’s going on.My intern friend says there’s a possibility that M is interested in me that’s why all these are happening, and that he probably told my colleagues about it. I’m afraid that this will affect my working relationship with him when I start my contract in March. I’m honestly pretty upset by all the rumours bc it’s such a bad start to my full time position."
relationship_advice,My wife's RAGE,"I'm not going to get into a lot of  detail and honestly I'll probably delete this in a couple days, but I was hoping to get some opinions. My wife and I have a volatile relationship. Fights get physical often, unless I submit or defuse her she'd likely hit/bite/spit/throw things every argument we have. 

One of her more recent outbursts, set off by me basically telling her I don't want to be her friend let alone husband, she got to throwing an assortment of things at me, one of which was her rather expensive engagement ring. I left the house, came back hours later and began picking up. I hadn't known she threw her ring, but wasn't surprised to find it on our kitchen floor. It's been thrown in anger before.

Now, when I found it I decided that it'd be safer put away somewhere. So I set it on a shelf in a high cupboard where we don't really put anything because my wife can't reach it.

This was about two weeks ago. She asked if I'd seen her ring yesterday and had been scouring the kitchen floor, connected bathroom floor and closet looking for it.

I wanted to ask Reddit, am I in the wrong for keeping it 'hidden'?"
relationship_advice,"Am I (25M) wrong to feel ""betrayed"" by my best friend (25F), because she want to remain friends with my cheater exgirlfriend (25F)?","First, English is not my first language. I understand it almost perfectly, but I'm bad at writing, so excuse any mistake. 

 **TL; DR in the bottom.**

Let's call my exgirlfriend “P” and my best friend “X”. All the context I will say is related to my relationship with P, but I think it is important to understand the title of the post.

X and I have been friends for over 6 years, while X and P have been meeting for about 5 years. I met P thanks to my friendship with X. The 3 of us ended up being ""best friends"" until 2018. 

The relationship I had with P was somewhat complicated and, for most of the time, it was toxic, especially after the first 4 months, at the end of the honeymoon phase. Although there is much I could say, without going into details, she was emotionally abusive and was with me only for convenience (we never had sex, we were virgins and she ""was not ready"" for that). P and I were dating for almost 3 years, and she finally break with me in 2018, because she could not stand my mood (I was somewhat depressed). She told me that it hurt a lot break with me, because I was someone very special in his life, but she wanted to take time for herself.

This affected me a lot and worsened my depression, although very little by little, I began to overcome it, until the year 2019 arrived. At the beginning of last year, I knew from an anonymous source, of ALL (really, all) the details of the ""new"" boyfriend of P. They had started dating since the beginning of 2018 (he was a ""friend"" of her work); also, has started having sex with him, a few weeks later (we were still boyfriends). I knew then, that she never wanted to have sex with me, because she was not physically attracted to me and, in the end, she was only with me for all the attention I gave him. That led me into a very deep depression throughout the year, even now I still some depressed.

I told all this to X, at the end of last year, because she was not aware of anything, even though P was her ""best friend"". X was surprised at everything I told him and I didn't want to believe me in the beginning (P was an ""innocent and tender"" girl), but she believed me in the end. Then, she understood why I was so depressed since the start of the year and why I had so much hatred for P. Then, she told me that she was very disappointed of P and that, although she did not cut off contact with her (I did it as soon as I knew everything), she would no longer see her as her friend. 

However, recently, X told me that she would never cease to be my friend and would always support me, but that she had already forgiven P and that she loved her as her friend because she had “made a mistake” in hurting me and was suffering from that. (P continues with the man she cheated on me with). She also said that, she didn't want to judge P for what he had done to me. That surprised me a lot and I couldn't avoid feel me betrayed by X. X said she wouldn't mention P when we talked, so as not to bother me, but that's no help because I still feel some frustration, since, although X knows all the damage P did to me, she still considers P a good person (she is manipulative and selfish).

These days I have seriously thought about ending my friendship with X, because I feel that, X is making a mistake by continuing to want to be a friend of P. P is not a good person, nor a good friend. Also I don't want to tell X, that she has to choose between me and P. However, X is a very good person and a very good friend, so I have also thought that maybe I am blinded by the hatred I have for P, and I should get over it so that X can continue to be friends with P and me, separately.

I would appreciate your opinions or any comments that help me to see more clearly this situation and not feel like a bad friend of X for thinking breaking our friendship.

**TL; DR:** My best friend wants to continue being a friend of my manipulative, selfish and cheater exgirlfriend and I feel betrayed for that reason. I think about ending my friendship with she, but I have doubts if is the ""correct"" decision."
relationship_advice,"My [30F] ex-friend told me [29F] she liked me because I have ""no drama."" Well, then my narcopath Father started stalking me and my husband, and I got flashbacks from abusive childhood. Then she dumped me after I confided in her, even though I said I was cutting them out.","TL;DR: Is the title. BTW, all my abusive family members are out of my life now - thanks! I called the authorities and hired a lawyer regarding crazy dad, too and he has since left me alone. Also I have a therapist. 

Story:

I have a problem oversharing, because of my unhealthy childhood (abusive parents teach you to fess up revealing info) so I gave this friend, who seemed to like me a lot, the truth. That my psycho dad started stalking me. That it turns out my family is full of pedophiles --&gt; I also told her I'm cutting them out of my life though and going to therapy. She seemed supportive. I did stop to ask her how she was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

But heck, I was going through a scary time in life. I was having panic attacks at home because of my dad's creepy phone calls. I needed a friend. And a therapist, too, - I was going to therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

But apparently I told her too much. Because she has since darted away from me, literally, every time she sees me now. It is so awkward. This ""friend"" used to invite herself over to my house, text me often, etc. But when I first met her she also said she liked me because I have ""no drama."" Well fuck, all of this DRAMA was NOT my fault! Maybe I dominated the conversation but actually, my other friends said I am good about venting, but then stopping myself and asking the other person ""I've talked enough, tell me how you're doing."" So it's not that.

&amp;#x200B;

Also this friend admitted to me she may have some abuse in her own household and she never left her parent's house, even as an adult with a kid now. So maybe there was some self reflection and she didn't like that I was cutting the abuse out of my life, while she was still living in it (forever maybe). 

&amp;#x200B;

Did I do something wrong? I DID learn a good lesson, that I should NOT divulge my satanic family (my estranged family) truths to a person I've only known a year or two. Sadly I thought knowing someone a year was enough. Nope.

I know I need to respect his boundaries and how he may not like doing something, which, in that sense, I completely understand. Just looking for some advice on this matter."
relationship_advice,My boyfriend goes MIA,My boyfriend is a bit of a shy guy and he’s told me many times that he doesn’t like to be around a lot of people for too long. Even being with just me for too long drains his social batteries he says. But sometimes completely randomly after we’ve just had a lovely day together and kissed goodbye he’ll not reply to any of my messages and completely ghost me for a whole day sometimes two. ( I can see that he has been on his phone as he’s marked as active on social media). Then he’ll come back and just act like nothing happened and I’ll ask what was wrong with him and if he was upset and he says he was fine just needed some alone time. Which I completely get! I just think it would be nice if he messaged me to let me know he’s okay and nothing bad has happened which I’ve asked of him before and he said he would but he’s ghosting me right now and won’t reply at all letting me know he’s fine. He won’t answer the phone at all. I don’t want to spam him and I want to give him his alone time I just wish he’d let me know that that’s what he’s doing and he’s okay. What should I do to make him understand how upset I get and that I need atleast a text to know he’s safe?

I told him about a month ago and he doesn’t reciprocate, which is fine, I still love him as a friend and it hasn’t impacted our friendship at all. But I know drunk me is going to be emotional, and there’s a high risk of me having a depressing time because of the romantic nature of the theme. I’m trying to get over it, but I need to distance myself to let the feelings detach, and we’re in the same classes (grad school) and run in the same friend groups, so it’s hard to get that separation. I want to just invite a few of our friends and tell them not to tell him, but that feels shady. I don’t want him to know this is still affecting me because I’m embarrassed that I haven’t gotten over it already. It’s not a big deal at all to him but it was a big deal to me. Would I be an asshole if I avoided inviting him, or told him not to come if he found out about it through a mutual friend?"
relationship_advice,I think my friend likes my husband. What do I do?,"throwaway account, posting for the first time via mobile, sorry for formatting. 

For the background: My husband Dan (30M) and I (30F) have been together for 4 years and have wonderful relationships. We are respectful, understanding and loving towards each other and I don't think any of us would want to screw that up. Our relationship are long distance as I work in a different area. At the moment we live around 50% of the time under the same roof and I plan to move back to the area permanently soon. 

And then there is my friend Lynn (26F), who is like sister to me and we've known each other since forever. She lives in the same area as Dan and we usually invite her if we host parties etc, also she and I hang out together whenever we can. 

I started noticing something when we hang out all together... Not like she flirted with Dan or did something weird, just some minor things that I catch, how she looks at us when we hug or dance together at the parties, and some other things (won't go into details, it will be too specific). I think she likes Dan, maybe she doesn't even realize it. 

I talked to Dan about it and he said he doesn't have any interest in Lynn as a woman whatsoever. But he doesn't understand either why she did certain things, so I guess I'm not overthinking. 

All my friends and family knows Lynn. So I have no-one to talk about it as I don't want in any way to change their impression of her. She didn't do anything that would seriously bother me and I don't want anyone to jump into conclusions. 

I am not sure whether I should do anything. Should I be worried? Guess for starters three of us could stop getting drunk together. Maybe there's something else I can do to prevent uncomfortable situations? It feels so odd."
relationship_advice,"Boyfriend (22M) might be checking my reddit history (21F), am I overreacting/overthinking?","Long story short, every time I feel something's odd in the relationship instead of telling him and causing a fight because maybe I'm just anxious and overthinking things, I'll just come here and read posts similar to what I'm going through.

Yesterday, I was reading r/deadbedroom posts and r/relationship_advice about lack of sex/lack of interest in intimacy from your SO. He hadn't initiated sex in weeks and he magically did last night. I'm sure he could've gone months without doing it.

This had happened in the past with smaller things like not going on dates or feeling like he wasn't affectionate enough and then everything was resolved after reading the posts, but I just brushed it off.

So now I think we only had sex because he knew I wanted it and not because he wanted me or whatever 

Or maybe this is all just a coincidence and I'm overthinking everything like I usually do? idk 

I'm not really looking for advice, I just want somebody else's input"
relationship_advice,"DAE have a ""normal"" relationship with the person who molested them as a child?","I sort of just want to know if this is a situation that other people experience, or if we are really just that fucked up.

My father molested my sister and I as children. I was young enough (diapers) that I don't have any memories that include imagery, but I have physical/body memories. My sister is 9 years older than me, she remembers what happened. She has never gone into detail, but she has said ""you wouldn't believe the things he made me do.""

This has always been ""normal"" for us. My dad confessed to my mother out of guilt when I was about a year old, and she kicked him out and divorced him. I think he changed his mind when shit got real, and fought hard to get full custody of us. My mother has told me she was prepared to change our names and run.

In the end my mom got full custody and my dad got supervised visitation. The abuse stopped there, except one time when I was 8 and he came into the bathroom after me but nothing happened because I told him to get out. (I had no memory/idea of the abuse at the time though, so it was just a strange exchange.)

My mother told me what had happened when I was 12. It was really weird. I never felt the same about my dad after, as I grew older my love for him faded, but I actually get along with him better as a person than my mom. We are good friends. 

This has presented challenges when dating, as you can imagine. My boyfriends have always been understandably disgusted and have reacted in different ways, but almost always by being hostile towards me for continuing a relationship with him, even going so far as to say that it must have been mutual (I was an infant)

My current boyfriend thinks it's weird, but he mostly pretends it doesn't exist, same as I do. He was super weird about it at first, but we have settled into comfortable denial and have lunch with my dad about once a month.

I just want to know, does anyone else live like this? Or are we just extra fucked up?"
relationship_advice,Feeling hostile towards boyfriend?,"I’m an 18F in a relationship with my bf (19M) and I’ve been feeling hostile towards him since like yesterday. I haven’t been rude or anything just like cold and replied with ”ok” ”cool” etc. Yesterday when we played a video game, he got mad and quit the game as well as left the call. This made me upset then he messaged me and said that he loves me, apologized and said that it wasn’t me he got mad at. I just left him on opened (this was on snap) then he continued snapping but i just left him on opened. I started crying (idk why honestly) and he said don’t cry and then proceeded to give me space. He sent a snap when I fell asleep but after that he started acting off, he seems so uninterested. I don’t even feel like talking to him rn. I feel like I’m being toxic. Maybe I’m just overreacting and expect everything to be rainbows and sunshine all the time, which it’s not gonna be obviously. I usually get irritated when someone isn’t acting chill and interested when talking to me. Maybe I’m too emotionally dependent on him? What do I do?"

relationship_advice,My Boyfriend wants to be together forever… I’m not so sure about it,"Sorry if I make mistakes, english isn’t my first language. 

OK, so despite the title, I do love my boyfriend very much. We’re really close. I am currently (temporarily) living in another country. I have a boyfriend here who’s really sweet and I love him greatly. He’s one of the best boyfriends I’ve ever had. 

Soon I will be returning to my home country, where it is really hard for him to visit, because it’s hard to get a visa where I live. Being a university student means I’m going to be BROKE, which means I can’t afford visas and flights a lot. This being said, I’m the only one who can really come to him because of the aforementioned visa issues. I can work in university, but most of that will go towards my living/general expenses. 

It could be about 3+ years before I see him again. I feel like that time will just be filled with pain and sorrow as we spend our limited time together missing each other and prolong the inevitable break up. I feel like it’s unfair to both of us. 

He says he’s not sure he can be friends with me and given his culture I see that he considers me to be his future potential wife. I don’t want to lose him and in any other situation I would want to continue dating him for a really long time. He says I’ve changed his life and he doesn’t know what he would do without me. 

Is it wrong of me to consider breaking up with him when J return? I just feel like all the pain for potentially years will not actually be worth it and we won’t even know how it works out. I don’t want to lose him as a friend."
relationship_advice,Update: My fiance(31M) wont let me(29F) go on a solo trip.,"The comments from my last post were a bit back and forth on the idea. Some defending me and some defending him. It was a good perspective from both sides.

The day after he seemed to still be fuming as he had some issues at work too and I didnt want him to blow up with the extra stuff. I gave him extra space to calm down.

Yesterday, we talked. We ended up sitting down and revisiting the whole situation. He admitted he wasn't listening and I admitted I came off pretty strong.

He told me he knows I'd be loyal to him and he never once questioned that from me. It was more of a safety concern for him. He wouldn't be there to protect me and he's terrified of something bad happening to me. 

I offered to restrict my traveling plans to a more safe route and also when I go out, I'll make group plans like joining tours for example. I'd stay in crowded areas, not eat at sketchy places, carry something that can atleast shake up an attacker like something that makes a loud noise. Also, he can review my plans and edit them if he doesn't feel good about something.

Im 100% down to make this more comfortable for both of us. He seemed to feel a little better and the conversation ended in a big hug with some laughing.  

We are planning on discussing the tiny little details when he comes home from work including the boundaries we can agree with which I think will be very easy for us. Essentially, don't be an idiot.

I'm really just happy we can work towards a compromise on this. He is awesome! :)"

Then just an hour ago she called me and was like you have no idea how hard it was for me to call you and I was kinda mad at her for everything but I pushed through and we talked for a little bit and she kept putting herself on mute every 10 seconds even when I was talking the thing is I know that she wasn’t cutting off because she didn’t have a problem hearing me. Idk. And then just now she texted me out of nowhere saying “hold on babe” but I wasn’t texting her and we didn’t say anything about that moment. Wtf does she mean by that.

relationship_advice,Told a classmate her partner was going to cheat with my best friend,"Hello everyone. I think this is going to be a bit messy but I would apprectiate your opinion on this topic (Sorry in advance as English is not my native language).

My best friend and me met on University 3 years ago, since then used to talk everyday and became flatmates as we really got along really well. Two years ago, he told me that he really liked a girl from class, and asked me for advice and so on, I really thought she liked him back so he asked her out, she agreed and according to him it was great. A few days later she told him that she was dating someone so he just gave up and went on with his life. 

A year later, my classmate with whom I get along pretty well told me that that she was the girlfriend and that she obviously was kind of mad with my best friend, I told her not to worry because he didn't mention her again since she told him she had a girlfriend. Then all of sudden we four would meet to play videogames, which was nice.

So some months ago or so my best friend told me that he had feelings for her again, and that she was kind of flirting with him in class. I told him that she was still with her girlfriend, so it was a risky situation. He was REALLY obsessed with her, like really. He would check her Spotify account to see if she listened to his music recommendations, he was checking her social media and last online, or just to see if she was online talking to her girlfriend.

So one day he texts me and tells me that she messaged him telling him that she liked him since he asked her out two years ago. First, I felt happy for him, then I felt sick to my stomach like what the hell? He told me that they were planning hang out that night to talk things out. I told him that she should talk to her girlfriend before doing anything. He basically told me to shut up and then changed the verstion and said they were going to study.

I decided to call my classmate and tell her the truth. I was so nervous and I did what I thought it was right, if someone were to cheat on me, I would have liked to know. She was crying, it was just horrible, she broke up with her and they both met until 3 or 4 am. 

My best friend obviously cut me off of his life. I really miss him sometimes, but I just don't think he did the right thing.

I can't stop overthinking about all this. Did I do the right telling her about all that?"
relationship_advice,"I (27M), and my GF(25f) are at a loss on how to fix our relationship","Going to do my best to explain the situation: throwaway btw.  

we both are very much in love, but lately more and more problems have been coming up that used to never be an issue.  

The first year or so of our relationship it felt so healthy, it didn’t feel like the relationship was work, and it felt easy and awesome, I could be me, she could be her, and we enjoyed the time we had together. I used to travel a lot more for work, and I think after a time she was wishing I was around more, understandably so. So I pumped the brakes on a job that kept me busy and financially secure so I could be around more. She has also had some career changes in the last year that weren’t exactly in her favor.

It’s also worth mentioning I started a new life in the town she lives in because I am nuts about her and would do anything for her.

Things aren’t going great financially but I got a new job, and it will require travel for most of the month while I get the next month off, and it pays really well and we have been talking about moving to a new city.  Definitely a big life change that we’re trying to do together and is bound to cause some stress.

Now for the meat of the matter

Lately I feel like I’m being attacked for every little thing I do. I take some work because I’m broke, and she’s pissed that I took the work. I don’t ever want her to feel invalidated so I tell her I will back out of the work I just took, and then she’s pissed at me because I’m turning something down because of her. She recognizes she’s being a little unfair, and I’m just trying to do what would make her happy, and we leave off with her saying something like “am I not allowed to be upset?”    Well... something very similar to this scenario is happening more frequently, lately every day. We talked recently and we know we both don’t want to give up, and we love each other a lot, but we are both losing our mental stability. I’m tired of being attacked constantly, I feel like I’m not good enough even though everything I do is for her. She thinks I’m inconsiderate and it feels like she’s just looking for opportunities to come down on me, and I don’t know what to do. 

Embarrassed to be posting here but I’m curious to get some outside insight. Counseling would be great, but I can’t afford it until my new job in a few months."
relationship_advice,2019 was a rough year for me(36f) due to back pain. Now my husband(36m) has no sex drive and I feel like it is all my fault. What can I do?,"My husband and I are both 36 and we have 3 kids and have been married for 14 years. 2019 I had severe back pain all year due to a car accident on my way to work in December of 2018. MRI’s countless doctor visits and on and off dozens of treatments and physical therapy and the pain came and went on how I would feel.  Mostly I felt like I was in pain 80percent of the day. The only place that was comfortable enough to sleep was the couch with 6 extra pillows, and having a two story home I rarely went upstairs and for a few months at a time my husband and I didn’t have sex. We discussed from time to time and I would say how I was sorry and he was understanding almost all the time. We’d find was to help him occasionally and it’s was rare for us to be in bed and engaged in intercourse only a couple times all year. 

I knew he wanted it frequently or more so than me, and we tried a few times but with medication killing my drive and my fear of pain from laying or being in some positions it was not something we did much.

Now that I’ve been so much better for the last 2 or so months he is so distant sexually. I feel like my horny husband is gone. I can’t help but feel it’s my fault and I did this to him. During 2019 I lost a lot of weight and walking helps me feel better. I can feel my drive coming back and  I get the cold shoulder from him at night when I initiate sex, and not just once but most of the time. My husband has never been like this. Again I feel terrible that it’s my fault. He tells me “you look great” and that he is “so happy with how sexy you are looking”. He’s not over weight and is in great health overall. 

So what can I do to help boost his sexual desire?

We used to be 1-2 times a week pretty steadily for the last 10 years even with the kids and all.
Prior to kids it was 2-3 times a week.

I know I should be patient but I want to know if there is things I can do to help.

Sorry for the long post!

TLDR:
Had major back pain for a year, and didn’t have sex very often with my husband. Now feel like it’s my fault for killing his sex drive. Need help to bring it back"
relationship_advice,"Kinda wanna ask someone out, dont know how tho","I know there is a lot more important and complicated posts here but im just gonna put this here too

I posted in here like two months ago, its still kinda the same and we have been talking regularly since then. We talked a lot, also about some personal stuff and i see that as a sign she is comfortable talking to me... Texting, at least. 

But given the fact that valentines day is coming up soon, which is not in particular the time, Just seems fitting, right? I was thinking about asking her out on some kind of date. Of course i want to do that right, and in Person but we really haven't been talking in Person at all. Although i see her quite often in school. 
So there are some things i am unsure about:
First, of course how would i get her to talk to me in Person, and how do i ask. Of course i dont want to put her on the spot in Public or something like that.

And, i dont even know if she likes me that way... Since i am the one initiating our chats regularly and sometimes i dont know if she even wants me to talk to her.
Also, since this would be my and most likely her first Date ever, i dont know where to go, If she says yes of course... that is my biggest concern.


I Just feel like the thought would be really weird... I dont even have her number. We just talk via Instagram dms but we've been doing that for Like 5 months now. Maybe i should ask for that first? 
But this dude in her dms asking her out suddenly... idk maybe thats just weird or not what she thought of me

I dont even know if posting this here i a good Idea... The last one got like no Attention and If she found this it would be reaaaally weird
But asking Strangers for help anonymously is a lot easier than finding someone to talk to in Person... yk


I just think i really like her but being the awkward 16 year old that i am, i'm a bit clueless how to approach. Shes kinda introverted/shy too, which doesnt make it easier and i think that should also affect the location of the date.


Anyways, maybe i'll delete it later If i change my mind on this. Answers/advice would be appreciated. 

If i find out how i will put the original Post in the comments or elsewhere.

relationship_advice,Time is up and I (40/M) need to know who to choose my wife (41/F) or my side chick (49/F),"I will start by saying I don't really expect that I will find helpful answers here. I am certain I will get pretty heavily bashed and probably rightly so. I think maybe writing out my situation in full for once might in itself be helpful.

I am middle-aged, been married for nearly 20 years. The last 5 years or so my wife hasn't really been involved in the marriage. She has been around, but she wasn't emotionally or really even physically available. She spent most of her time in another part of the house away from me and the kids using marijuana pretty heavily. Many times I tried to repair our relationship but she just wasn't ready and told me so. I do know that throughout this period while my wife wasn't really around and struggling with her own medical and substance abuse issues she remained faithful to me. 

About two years ago I started having an online affair with another woman. It quickly progressed into very inappropriate behavior on the phone and inappropriate pictures. She was also in an involved relationship so there was an understanding between us. About a year ago her relationship ended and the two of us started to spend more and more time together. We did eventually meet and have sexual relations. After some time I even met her children and we started to plan a future together.

3 months ago I went to my wife and told her that I thought we should separate. After some financial calculations, we decided that we would do an in-home separation. The idea in my mind was to be with the new girl, although I never told my wife about her and she never suspected. My wife promised to kick her habit, seek counseling and become a part of our family again. 

As of today, she seems to have really made good on her promise and our relationship has been getting stronger and closer. Her re-entry into our kids' lives has made a world of difference. She is becoming the woman that tI originally fell in love with again. 

The problem I have now is I have been essentially leading two women on. The clock is ticking because Valentine's day is coming and I long ago made plans for a trip with the other woman and I am pretty sure my wife will notice that I am missing. I know that if I tell my wife about the other woman our marriage would be over, and I am not certain that I can lie about it for the rest of my life even if I did manage to cut it off with the other woman today.

I have no idea what to do, I really truly love the second girl, but, I have children, a long history, and new feelings for my wife that I haven't felt in a very long time."
relationship_advice,Should I tell a guy that he's being cheated on.,"This woman I am working with has been cheating/having an affair with some one for almost a year now. I figured she was going to stay with her live in ""boyfriend"" during the Christmas time, but she hasn't broken things off but is still having an affair with the other guy.  Should I just tell this guy he's being cheated, if I do, how?"
relationship_advice,Been with my long distance gf almost 2 years now and she keeps being distant with me over her wanting to have unpotected sex without birth control.,"My long distance girlfriend and has said to me I cannot give her what's she wants/ needs? 
Althought I show her support and affection I'm always there for her I plan out visits by myself and obvs we have sex when I visit she knows how I feel about her and how much I care about her and that I'm trying to work on progressing our relationship such as work stuff to hopefully to close the distance in the near future . But shes still stuck on having sex without protection. It just makes me seem like she forgets everything else I do for her and that's the only thing she wants me for. I dont know how to handle this situation as she wont talk about it as theres 1.nothing I can do to fix it.
2. Shes tired of talking about it(she wont come to a compromise either)
3. She said its somthing I have to sort out by myself 
So basically I have to fix our relationship problem on my own and I dont know how to. 
I'm getting tired of the same situation again and again as it's like treading on egg shells when ever it comes up as I really dont know what to say
I'm looking for advice as I dont want to lose her and I want to work on closing the distance before we think about kids and stuff.
Sorry if this seems like a jumble of words.
My questions are:
*How can I help her see a child at this time isnt going to help us at all?
*How can I reassure her that I do love her and I want the same things for our future?
*how can I diffuse the situation when it comes up?
I mean I want to be with her like that also but I think the risk of pregnancy when you can take steps to avoid it why bother risking it without protection/ birthcontrol we arent prepared and if we use protection and it fails then we both step up to the plate and do everything we can for our child."
relationship_advice,Boyfriend wants to adopt a kid.,"I'm in a gay relationship with my boyfriend and we both love each other very much. We're both 17 and today, he made it clear that he plans on adopting a child at some point in his life; the thing is, I absolutely abhor children. I like him so much and I know he likes me too, but I'm afraid and confused as to how this is gonna turn out in the future. Sorry about any English mistakes, it's not my native language. I know it's too early to be thinking about stuff like this, but it's driving me insane."
relationship_advice,"I (27f) feel like I’m paying for the guy I’m dating (31m) more when we go out, and it’s made worse by his complicated living situation. Am I wrong for feeling mad?","So I’ve been dating this guy for about two months and overall things have been going well. The one thing that’s been bothering me recently is that I feel like I’ve been paying more for when we go out on dates and such. It’s normally that we split it or I end up paying for us both. I have no issue splitting the bill, but it always feels like whenever I mention going out he’s just paid a major bill and he can’t pick up my part of the tab ever. Like tomorrow I have a friend coming to visit and I also want to see him and have him come along because we haven’t been able to see each other recently with our schedules, and he brought up how he just paid his rent so he’s low on money.

And we can only ever go out and do things because I can’t go into his apartment. He’s living with his ex at the moment, they broke up a few months after moving in together, and she doesn’t want any of his dates in there. She even accused him of lying and having me in the apartment when she was at work on a day where we weren’t even in town and has threatened that she’ll message me in the hopes of getting us to break up. His lease is up in March and he plans on moving out or getting a new roommate to move in. I also have a hectic schedule, I’m commuting a lot with work and grad school and live with my family so having him over isn’t the best option either. He also doesn’t have a car at the moment so I’m the one doing all the driving 99% of the time. 

It’s early in the relationship so I’m trying to be patient but I’m starting to get annoyed at this whole situation. I get he has bills to pay that I don’t, but I also have bills like loans, gas, car maintenance, groceries, etc., that are in my name or ways to help my parents since I’m not paying them rent and try to help out in other ways. If March comes and goes and no improvement in his housing situation was made I was already going to reconsider this, but this whole thing about him paying rent and having no money to at least pay for his own food is making me upset. I’m about to tell him tomorrow that he needs to put his foot down with his roommate and get over his confrontation avoidance because I’m getting tired of this.

Am I getting too upset over this or should I rethink this relationship? I’m a pretty patient person and he has a lot of crazy stuff going on in his life right now so I’m trying to be understanding. I like him but I can’t put up with this for much longer."
relationship_advice,My bad driving is putting a strain in our marriage,"I’ve been commuting to work since September. I drive at least 550 miles a week. I know that’s not a lot to some, but to me it is. I got a total of three tickets. Two for speeding and one for inattentive driving. 

We are going to plead this month for the two speeding ones. The attorney tried to scare me saying I could has jail time for going 15 over. Meaning I could lose my job, my license, everything I’ve built up for. 

The problem here is why now? Why after 8 years of driving am I getting these so bad? The problem is how far away in driving. I’m an accountant I use my brain power almost all day long and I don’t have a lot of hobbies since I’m a recent graduate that left that behind years ago. So my mind tends to wander when I drive and I do mistakes. 

If you think my attorney was being mean by telling me I could go to jail, my husband was pretty mad. He’s pointed at my diploma at the wall and stated how an educated women couldn’t read speed limits. He’s told me how if I went to jail and had a record, that would ruin our future. He’s told me lots of things and I’m so upset with myself. I can feel myself going into a depressed state. 

He has a right to be mad. He just doesn’t understand my side. He can’t empathize and he talks to me until a cry and then leaves me alone. 

I don’t know what to do. Please help."
relationship_advice,My Girlfriend Abuses Me Every Day.,"I’m a 29 year old guy and my girlfriend is 26. We’ve been together for almost six years and we met when we were kids, and started as best friends. She’s been through a lot of terrible relationships and I try to treat her as good as I possibly can. Lately she’s been stressed because she just got later off and she’s struggling to find a job (we live in NYC)

Well she’s been taking her anger on me and I’m getting tired of it. It’s been about two months of non stop arguing and emotional abuse. I consider myself to be a really nice guy and I’m not the type of person to disrespect women so I kind of try to brush it off. She calls me an asshole, fat, and talks down when I mention my dreams and goals. Even when I’m with my friends she embarrasses me and I’m just really tired of it. I don’t enjoy being around her at all. 

What should I do? I don’t know if this can be fixed or if I really want to fix it because things have just changed and our relationship isn’t the same. I’m torn. Just not happy and sick of the abuse. Any suggestions? I need help. 

TL DR :
Girlfriend is emotionally abusive and I’m tired of it. Not sure what to do."
relationship_advice,I uncovered something a bit weird. Wwyd?,"Hello Reddit
My (32f) boyfriend (36m) of a year has a contact in his phone labeled ""unknown"". I reverse searched the number to find out it was his ex, who was previously (during the course of our relationship) in his phone under her actual name- Sarah. 

A little background- I feel like we have an amazing relationship. The only hiccup is a couple months in I saw him texting someone named Sarah who replied ""WTF"" to something he wrote. I didn't think to ask about it until a few months later because I trust him deeply. To his credit, he answered honestly that it had been his ex texting him. Prior to that he had declared there was zero contract with any exes. I blew up and it was a rocky few days afterwards. He said she was just checking in and he turned her down. I chose to believe him. He was adamant that he had not talked to her since and never would again. 

So now that I've discovered her number is disguised under ""unknown"" (quite clever actually) what is my next step? Is it unheard of for a current girlfriend to text an ex and politely inquire? The search gave me her Facebook too. Would it be better just to confront my boyfriend? The negative potential in this scenario is making my stomach turn. Please advise."
relationship_advice,Fiancee cheated because I didn’t hotwife,"So he has always kept the fetish from me despite me, in four years, digging to find out what turns him on. He was so closed off and denied me sex for years. I got on antidepressants because my self esteem suffered from this. He finally told me this after three years together. I was supportive, but he was always terrified to tell me. I don’t know why, I am very open minded and he knowst this. Anyways, cut to a few weeks ago and I find out he has a secret snapchat and has been sexting his exes who are more promiscuous than I am. 

I expressed that I would indulge the fantasy, like talking about hot guys I would see, but I am not comfortable having sex with other people. He would seem to be satisfied, get off in literal seconds, but I guess it wasn’t enough. He basically finally after DAYS of interrogation, admits that they cheat on their spouses and he likes that. So, I am not sexually attractive to him because I only wanted to have sex with him. The exes cheated all throughout the relationship btw and that is what ended these relationships. So wtf? Help? Advice?"
relationship_advice,my ex has come back after getting an std,"My boyfriend (Well ex atm) were together for 1 year. I was his first girlfriend (he's 24) and I was wary of this when we started dating(im 20). A year in and he ghosted me for two weeks (he told me it was over and didn't text me again) and then came back wanting to be together. He later told me he may have caught something from someone he slept with when we broke up. Obviously I was very. upset about this and were not together at the moment. but...

\- he broke up with me because he felt he couldn't offer me anything at the time (he felt I was doing better than him)

\- he has changed a lot since the break up (gotten a new car, promotion at work, saving up for a house)

\- he has been here for me since he came backthis is the main point for me as him leaving me out in the cold has opened a lot of childhood wounds up for me. But in all honesty he has been really supportive and always was when we was initially together.Ive gone through the motions and im starting to feel better again. Do you think I should get back together with him based of what I have said here? Or do you think he is likely to let me down again or is a bad fit? or that I should just let it go? I do love him a lot (I guess otherwise I wouldn't be writing on here) and I don't feel this way often at all"
relationship_advice,my (F24) boyfriend (25) told me he was drunk at home... 5 hours later he tells me he just got home from a friends house.... is that suspicious?,"We’ve been seeing each other for 8 months now. Last night I know he was at home drinking and playing video games, and I could tell that he was decently drunk. After my last message to him, he responded 5 hours later telling me he had gone to “Kyle’s house and had been drinking and he’s home safe now”.... which I totally don’t mind that he went out, but the whole thing was just weird. 

First of all, I’m not super familiar with his friends so him name dropping a random friends name (who I’ve never heard of) caught me off guard. Second, he was already pretty drunk and I know he’s not the type to drive drunk. Third, in the past when he’s been with his friends he’s had no problem with talking to me at the same time. The only times he hasn’t was in the very very beginning of relationship when we were still dating other people and he was with other girls.

He’s never given me a reason to NOT trust him, and I’m probably being overly suspicious for no reason, but the whole thing just seemed off to me. Am I crazy? I tried talking to him about it this morning and he’s seen the message but yet to respond sooooo."
relationship_advice,Bf just admitted sleeping with someone else 3 months into us dating,"I’ve just been blindsided and feel like I could use some outsider opinion- I’m beyond conflicted. 

Backstory: I met my current bf back in March.. at first we were just getting to know each other and casually dating. A couple months in, we did discuss being exclusive and that we were only dating each other. By August, things had continued to get better daily and by end of September we were completely in love with each other. Since then it’s been smooth sailing and not a glimpse of doubt in my mind that this is the man I want to be with.

Fast forward to yesterday. Out of nowhere, my bf tells me that back in May, he slept with a girl while on a trip who is connected to our friend group. We’re supposed to rent a house with a group of friends this weekend, and she will be there. Honesty I’m completely shocked and I have no idea what to do or think. He says that back then, he didn’t see our relationship going anywhere, he thought he’d be breaking it off once he returned from that trip where he screwed her, and that it wouldn’t have ever mattered. And yet he texted me when he got back, we hung out again, and again.. He had no idea or intention apparently of falling in love with me, but here we are today.

Part of me understands that we were newly getting to know each other. But at the time he cheated, we had very much discussed us only seeing each other. From where I sit today, I cannot seem to get over the fact that this relationship was propped up on the idea that he and I had only been with each other since we started dating. Idk why, but this is very important to me- I feel like I’ve lost trust and I’m so hurt. That he’s held this in for months and we’ve gone through so much, talk about the future, etc. and then he drops this on me. And not only just sharing this information, but expecting me to still go on this weekend trip and meet the girl he slept with DURING the time we had been already dating?!

I just am lost for words and thoughts and clearly am struggling to look at this objectively. Do I end this relationship with the person I want to spend forever with, or do I try moving forward, finding a way to be understanding and forgiving, since we weren’t by any means in love at that point in our relationship? Knowing myself, I’m worried that I may never be able to let this go, as I would’ve never done something like that myself and set a high standard for the man I’d marry one day. I do want to stress though, he treats me incredibly and up until this point, I have never wavered once on how I feel about him. I truly do feel he is my person.

Thank you for your advice/thoughts, they are so appreciated."
relationship_advice,I(18/M) caught my BF(18) of 1.5 years Flirting/Messaging with two other guys last night,"Last night I was spending some quality time with my BF because he told me he was feeling lonely and missing me alot (we see eachother once or twice a week usually do to chaotic school schedules and parents). So I have spent the last two days with him.  Wensday night he was burried in my chest and acting broken, saying things like ""im so sorry.  I took you for granted. I love you"" and he kept repeating it for the entire night not wanting to look me in the eyes. This raised my suspicion and I decided that I can kill two birds with one stone last night.  I can figure out what happened and give him the time with me he is craving.  Well when I got to his house (living with his mother) he was asleep with his phone next to him, and a suspicious message from a app named ""Yubo"" that I did not recognize.  After searching it I quickly put together that he was doing something wrong but it may not be cheating.  I tricked him into unlocking his phone to stream to his TV then when he set it down I grabbed it and put it on the charger (yes I know this is a sly and shameful move but this is the only time I have ever invaded his personal space). That is when I opened his messages and saw that he was talking with two guys. One 19 the other unknown. Using the same EXACT things he does for me to show affection.  Same nicknames emojis and whatnot, but I realized he stopped messaging both of them on Monday and from what I could tell every attempt the other guys made to actually meet him he either avoided or didn't go through with. (This is that I know of).  After confronting him about it he quickly became extremely ashamed and admitted there were 2 guys he had been Flirting with but HAD not met as they both live over 2 hours away.   He then begged me to talk about this and to stay with him while again trying to collapse into my chest.   After asking him why he did it he said ""im so lonely I don't see you enough, it was more of a game to me"" he also said he would choose me over both of them and that neither of them actually matter to him.   I blocked both contacts and deleted them after sending both guys a message stating who I was what he did, (it's not there fault they didn't know what was happening and I wanted them to know truthfully what was happening to spare any soul out there the pain that I am dealing with).    I did agree to give him another chance on the condition that I have access to his phone   that he deletes Yubo and his account and Snapchat where I believe he met the first one.   He agreed   I realized today that the first guy (let's call him #1)  he had been chatting with on one of our dates a month ago but it didn't seem suspicious out just like a friend chatting about movies and college stuff didn't strike me as something serious or that he ever would do this to me.  Well #1 was planning a meeting with him I believe some time this weekend. Which if I didn't shut down already. I will be making sure he doesn't get to attend because he CHOSE to remain with me.  I did ask him who makes him the happiest and who he wants to be with.  As I said before he wanted me.       

Im wondering now what should be done as I don't have alot of trust at the moment. However I believe that he was doing it for attention as he constantly seeks validation that he looks good, is a good person, etc. Childhood trauma causes problems. I absolutely want to trust him again and be with him and he swears he want me and that only our relationship is ""real"".    Does all of his ""regret"" seem like a farce or truth to you.     Because hanging your head in shame seems a little like a trick.   He has been messaging me pretty consistently today shitty pick up lines and jokes and whatnot. Not a word about yesterday so far."
relationship_advice,How to break up with a long term boyfriend?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend since we were 15. We both turn 19 this year. 
He was my first real relationship, and my first love. I honestly thought I’d marry him and stay together forever. Whilst I was like this, he was the opposite. 
The tables have turned over the last few months.
As I’ve got older, I’m realising that this is unlikely, as I don’t think we’re that compatible. As I’m slowly outgrowing him, he’s becoming more keen. He’s very stuck to me, and rather needy. He wants me to prioritise him over my education and even suggests that I leave university because he wants “all of my time, not just some”. He’s very affectionate, and constantly tells me it’d hurt him badly if I were to break up with him. 
Unfortunately, I don’t think we will work out in the future so I know it’s best to break things off.
How do I do this exactly? What do I say? I know ultimately he will be hurt, but I want to minimise this if I can. I care about him, and have a lot of love for him, but it just isn’t meant to be."
relationship_advice,"My friend is convinced I'm his ""guardian angel,"" but has been antagonizing everyone else close to me. Please help.","This is a complicated situation, so thank you in advance for hearing me out. I'm 21F and the friend is 19M. Last fall, a group of 20 or so students from my college went on an educational trip to a large city. I didn't know him very well but we hung out when we had some free time to get lunch. When we were crossing the street, he stepped out without looking. I had some city smarts from traveling, and I knew the truck barreling down the road wasn't going to stop for him, so I grabbed the back of his shirt and yanked him out of the road impulsively. It wasn't intentional, more just a spur-of-the-moment decision where I didn't want an acquaintance to get hit by a car on a school trip.

After that, he became convinced that I was his guardian angel and stared calling me his best friend. I thought he was nice, but I need time to really get to know people, so I was caught off guard and just went with it. Over the course of the next few months, he wrote me letters often, sent me gifts, and was a good listening ear. And he did grow on me. He's looked up to me sort of like a mother figure and we've been able to have some good chats and traveled together again for another school trip.

However, he got really mean this past year. I'm not sure what happened, but I took a semester to go abroad, and it turned out that in my absence, he had been antagonizing a number of people: most notably, our boss, our debate teammates, and my ex-girlfriend who I have had to work unbelievably hard to restore a friendship with.

His behaviors led to him being removed from the debate team yesterday. He threw a fit that impacted both myself and a number of my friends. Now, hanging out with him has become exhausting because he's not only being nasty to me, but he's also being incredibly disrespectful to people who write my checks and make my life worth living, and they all associate me with him.

I consulted my ex-girlfriend who is (hopefully) still my friend after all of this, since he had also cozied up to her at one point before causing her issues as well. We had been talking about some of his other unacceptable behaviors together in weeks prior and had been meaning to address them with him, but the whole debate team situation threw us both for a loop and now we don't know when the right time is (if ever) to try to talk to him about his actions. She was furious with him for jeopardizing my job but said that much should be up to me to talk to him about, which I agree with. It's more his other mean behaviors like being nasty to our friends and making inappropriate comments about our relationship as exes that we felt needed to be addressed. He also had been following me around, sent me pictures of my door one day, and texted me several times asking if I was still at x location without having given him any real indication where I was. But that's more on the back burner now.

Is this friendship worth saving, and if so, how do I even begin to go about that? Or is it better to just sit him down and say I need space until he learns to fix his behaviors?

TL;DR a close friend who loves me has been nasty and disrespectful to other people I care about, including me. Is it worth saving the friendship or do I let him go?"
relationship_advice,I have found myself in a unique situation,"    I (22m) was talking to a girl (22f) for some time before we started dating for a short while before we went back to being friends because she was still thinking about her ex. The ex packed up one day and left when she was at college so she was confused as to what made him leave. I feel the need to mention the fact i didn't fuck her because we only went on 2 date because she lives like 2 hours away from me and first one the vibe was kinda off because a close friend of hers got sent to ER for crashing his motorcycle and the second we just cuddled and fell asleep. 
      I know that for the most case that that is a way girls break off relationship they dont want or some shit but here is where i am having a problem, she kept talking to meand everything was good but now im worried for her. She told me that shit went toxic with the ex because she had got pregnant and he wanted to keep it but she knew they wouldn't be able to take care of it right so she had an abortion. The ex came back and reminded her of that. She is incredibly depressed and is get high every night because she is getting nightmares about the abortion and her ex. 
    She goes to hangout and sleep over with her friend who went to the ER and im a bit jealous because she doesn't talk to me as mush as she used or atleast not with the same weight anymore but thats besides the point. The point is right now is she is ghosting me and i would leave it like that if i didnt know she all fucked up the way she is. Should i text her again or should i drop it cuz idk what to do in this situation."
relationship_advice,"Question: committed, living apart and communicating","So my partner (m 32) and I (f 29) live apart in the same town. We've been together about 9 months. Committed and monogamous. We really only see each other on weekends due to work/being busy. Usually, we talk via messenger at least once a day. But since I saw him monday (to get some stuff I left at his place over the weekend) we havent spoken. We aren't fighting or anything,  everything's been really good. Usually we talk regularly.  Often I would message him and he would respond most of the time when he could. But I felt like I was texting too much and reaching out way more than him. So I've been trying to only message if its necessary and for the past few weeks he text or calls me when he's off work. But this week it has been radio silent. I'm feeling insecure to an extent. I'm just wondering how often couple who live apart go without saying anything to each other? Like what's normal? This is my first relationship where we dont live together. I havent messaged because I've been kind of... exploring my insecurity around it and trying to just sit with my feelings in a meditative way in hope of understanding it better and maybe resolving the insecurity in time... but I've come to this point where I'm just curious, how long will this go? How long do other couples go without talking/what's the norm? 
Thanks"
relationship_advice,Is he just using me? I really like him,"This guy I really like is making me feel so confused... we were texting for a week or so before he asked me to come out for drinks with him, he was really nice and we got on well and he paid for all of the drinks. he walked me to my bus and told me he really enjoyed the night the next day he asked me if I wanted to come over to his house to ‘chill’ but I couldn’t so he asked again the next day, I said yeah and went over.. we were just in his room the whole time listening to music and watching movies, and he smokes a lot of weed so obviously that involved a lot of smoking (not me) after a while we started kissing and we ended up having sex which we both said we would wait for, anyways it happened and his mom came home and he introduced me and she dropped me into the city with him, she didn’t seem too fazed to see a girl over so I’m guessing this is something he does often I’m not sure though. Anyways he’s just asked me to come over again next week but I’d like to have a proper date and idk how to say this without seeming desperate especially as I don’t know his intentions with me, are we casual now??"
relationship_advice,Dare uk college,"Today i was dared to add my teacher on facebook she laughed and i deleted her and blocked her straight away.then 2hr later she went and reported me to a person.whats gonna happen to me boys 😂
Bearing in mind im 17 and it was literally a joke"
relationship_advice,Why is she so unfair to me?,"I've been loving this Girl(24F) for 3 years and has been my all around crush ever since I entered college(24M), however, she never loved me back. What pisses me off isn't truly that she doesn't love me, what pisses me off are the reasons why she doesn't love me: she basically let's all people that are not his boyfriend touch her ass, wrestle on her and she even laughs about it. I was always considered by to be cute, she even admitted it, but I was always too much of a nice guy which has been an obstacle on my way with our relationship. Then, two years ago I finally changed myself, got tired and became a sociopath(not in the litteral sense), but now that I finally meet all the requirements to get her attracted she treats me like shit and was almost gonna call the police just beacuse I had touched her ass once: why is she so hypocritical towards me?"
relationship_advice,Am I being too controlling? My boyfriend keeps going on different forms of social media to check out other girls and I've told him it bothers me.,"As the title said, my boyfriend keeps going onto random girl's instagrams, TikToks, or Visco pages looking at sleazy pictures. This first started to bother me a couple of months ago when I noticed that many of the girls he was following only had platforms to post half-naked pictures. I know that guys look, but the fact that he was so obviously doing it hurt my feelings. When I asked him about it he first denied it, but it's hard to deny people that you're following. After that he temporarily deleted all forms of social media bc he said I apperently ""just couldn't trust him."" I naturally felt terrible and convinced him to get his social media back bc I knew this would turn into something about me. I did make him aware though that my feelings were hurt that none of the girls looked anything like me. 
Anyway, after feeling like crap for being too controlling and hearing about how I'm too jealous in a relationship (even though he gets upset when guys follow me even if I dont follow them back), I assumed this was the end of it. Following the incident, he's now secretive with his phone and whenever I ask to borrow it for something he'll insist that he types what I need. It's obvious that he's still looking at girls and honestly at this point I'm just tired of him lying about it. Was I overreacting in the first place, and should I even be upset about it now? I'm still not sure if I should confront him about it, but I'm hurt. Any opinions/advice would help. Thanks!"

relationship_advice,"Friend is convinced I'm his ""guardian angel"", but I don't want to be friends anymore.","This is a complicated situation, so thank you in advance for hearing me out. I'm 21F and the friend is 19M. Last fall, a group of 20 or students from my college went on an educational trip to a large city. I didn't know him very well but we hung out when we had some free time to get lunch. When we were crossing the street, he stepped out without looking. I had some city smarts from traveling, and I knew the truck barreling down the road wasn't going to stop for him, so I grabbed the back of his shirt and yanked him out of the road impulsively. It wasn't intentional, more just a spur-of-the-moment decision where I didn't want an acquaintance to get hit by a car on a school trip.

After that, he became convinced that I was his guardian angel and stared calling me his best friend. I thought he was nice, but I need time to really get to know people, so I was caught off guard and just went with it. Over the course of the next few months, he wrote me letters often, sent me gifts, and was a good listening ear. And he did grow on me. He's looked up to me sort of like a mother figure and we've been able to have some good chats and traveled together again for another school trip. 

However, he got really mean this past year. I'm not sure what happened, but I took a semester to go abroad, and it turned out that in my absence, he had been antagonizing a number of people: most notably, our boss, our debate teammates, and my ex-girlfriend who I have had to work unbelievably hard to restore a friendship with.

His behaviors led to him being removed from the debate team yesterday. He threw a fit that impacted both myself and a number of my friends. Now, hanging out with him has become exhausting because he's not only being nasty to me, but he's also being incredibly disrespectful to people who write my checks and make my life worth living, and they all associate me with him.

I consulted my ex-girlfriend who is (hopefully) still my friend after all of this, since he had also cozied up to her at one point before causing her issues as well. We had been talking about some of his other unacceptable behaviors together in weeks prior and had been meaning to address them with him, but the whole debate team situation threw us both for a loop and now we don't know when the right time is (if ever) to try to talk to him about his actions. She was furious with him for jeopardizing my job but said that much should be up to me to talk to him about, which I agree with. It's more his other mean behaviors like being nasty to our friends and making inappropriate comments about our relationship as exes that we felt needed to be addressed. But that's more on the back burner now.

Is this friendship worth saving, and if so, how do I even begin to go about that? Or is it better to just sit him down and say I need space until he learns to fix his behaviors?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR a close friend who loves me has been nasty and disrespectful to other people I care about, including me. Is it worth saving the friendship or do I let him go?"
relationship_advice,Can't get over my SO's friend,"SO and i have gone on 5 dates.  We decided to get into a relationship. 

We haven't gone beyond holding hands and hugging each a little at the end of each date. 

She's cute. She think I'm cute. I thought we had decent conversation. Both of us aren't big on booze or parties. We're both health conscious and serious about our careers. 

It was all going fine until she made me meet her friends - two of them a boy and a girl. Let's call the girl Stella and the boy Bob. 

Stella and I hit it off instantly. We spoke a lot across the table. Like a lot. We had a lot in common. And i finished some of her sentences. There was genuine electricity Between us. And i had to keep trying to bring my SO and Bob into the conversation because they were quite lost and out of place.

But Stella and i kept jumping from one topic to the next to find common threads. 

At the end of the evening, SO and are walking down the road back home. She's very silent. And then after much hesitation, she says ""We don't really have anything in common, do we?""

I think she was really upset that Stella and I got along so well, and spoke with such high energy. 

Now, i feel really bad. I want to be with Stella. I don't think my SO is the one for me. We don't have too much to talk about, the conversation isn't great. It is mediocre and i think I've developed a bias against my SO after the Stella meeting. 

SO ans Stella work together. They are quite close. Been good friends for 6 months. 

Stella and i email each other to talk about books. And all kinds of other things. I can see the same desire in her. She's single. And I'm so worried about her dating someone else. 

My 3 questions

1) Is my chemistry with Stella worth chasing? Does this last in the long term? 

2) My SO is a pretty, smart and sincere person. She really lieks me. But we are opposites in many ways, does that work in the long term?

3) What should i do? Please help me."

relationship_advice,What should i (m27) do about my relationship with my dad? I'm lost :(," Hello,

Firstly a bit of backstory.
My dad and i had always gotten on well and we seemed more like friends than father and son.
This was largely until my parents split up when i was 17.
Since then it has been largely up and down. Sometimes great sometimes bad. 

He is very corporate, works hard and earns a fair bit of money, i on the other hand am an art student currently on disability benefits  for a mixture of crohn's disease and mental health issues.

Now down to the issue.

Just before christmas my fiancě and myself were kindly invited by him and his wife (my step mum) to join them on holiday at a luxury all inclusive resort as a part of his 50th birthday celebrations. We were all excited as it looked to be the holiday of a lifetime.

The holiday was mostly lovely except for one day when my fiance was ""told off""/ scolded by my step mum for something political she had posted online. The post was not directed at anybody. But it was clear this left wing joke had not been recieved well by my right wing step mum and my dad.
During this telling off the price of the gifted holiday was brought up and my fiance was made to feel very guilty and came to me in tears asking if we should pay for our portion of the holiday.

I went to my dad and said hey can we try and smooth things over as my fiance is really upset by this.
He ignored this and so with only a couple of days left of the holiday we tried to forget about it and make the most of it.

Once we got home plans started being drawn up for a large family party that would be taking place on my dads actual birthday, during which my fiance told me that she was not sure she wanted to go, as the situation between her and my step mum still felt uncomfortable for her. ( i should mention she is pretty shy)

So being an adult i thought i would write an email to them expressing how she felt and why she would not be joining me at the party (this email was pretty strongly worded but not rude or insulting in my opinion) 

And **KABOOM!!! ****all hell broke loose, step mum immediately blocked me on facebook and removed me from the party planning group, i received messages from my step siblings all saying how unkind i was and rude.

I spoke to my dad and we agreed to meet up and try to smooth things over. So we met at a hotel between us and had a meeting.
In which my fiance and i were keen to fix things and move on as we both felt it had gotten out or hand.

But alas they did not seem to want this, they were very mad, and just shouted and personally insulted us. Rather than listening and trying to move foward.
They then walked out without things being resolved.

So here we are over a month and a half later.
And i have still had no contact with either of them.
Step mum still has me blocked but dad does not.

Normally in the past i find conflict unbearable i will often take the loss for the sake of peace as i find ongoing conflict very upsetting and stressful.but things are different now, rather than it just being about myself this now includes personal attacks from both of them on my fiance something im finding hard to forgive.

I will not back down but i would be lying if i said seeing my dad online does not hurt me, i even had to take off my family signet ring as looking at it was making me feel really sad.

I feel lost, let down and angry. My dad has chosen backing up his wife over attempting to fix things with me.

The way i see i have 2 options.

1.he turns up here and apologises.(it would have to be pretty big aplogy) 

2. I cut ties, block him and move on with my life.(i would probably also change my surname.)

I have fantastic relationship with my brother and my mums side of the family so i won't be without family.

 Its the limbo that's killing me. I have no idea if he is just stubborn or genuinely does not care. But he has made 0 attempts to fix it so far.

**TL:DR fell out with dad, struggling to forgive him, should i cut ties or be a doormat.(again)  **"
relationship_advice,Should I (29M) give her (36F) a 2nd chance?,"Long story cut shortish I caught my girlfriend (of 5 months) had been talking to her ex (for the past 1.5 months at least), met up twice for lunch/dinner, and was accepting money from him after his drug addiction/manipulative behavior did a number on her financially/emotionally when they used to be together. He says he's clean now and is begging for her to take him back.

She said she knows he's toxic and only wanted money from him since she has some debt (partially because of her ex) but was too embarrassed to tell me. She said nothing physical happened and from their emails I could tell nothing happened (he was mad about it after they met up and that she'd talk about me).

My problem is she hid this from me for at least 1.5 months and makes me wonder what else could she hide from me for that long? If she would of been up front about this whole situation and reassured me (minus the meetups), I would of been ok with it.

I ended things with her but up until this situation everything else had been as close to perfect as could be and she feels the same way. A couple days later she said she told her ex not to contact her anymore and that she doesn't want his money, which she did on her own accord without me telling her to do that. She seems genuinely remorseful about her breaking my trust, says she'll do whatever it takes to get me back, and that she sees/wants a future with me.

Should I give her a 2nd chance or would you move on?"
relationship_advice,I'm (21M) worried about my boyfriend's (23M) health and him being very thin,"So as the title says, I'm quite worried about my boyfriend being too skinny, and no matter how I try to bring it up, he kinda just shrugs it off or gets weird about it 

He's 5'11, 110lbs (last he checked months ago), white male if that matters, and is 23 years old. I wouldn't say that he's acting sickly is suffering from some sort of vitamin deficiency, that we know of...I can't get him to go to the doctors just to check and make sure. I've brought it up multiple times just to make sure his health is okay and he's dismissive of it 

As you've probably already guessed, we're both apart of the LGBT community where there's already a sort of stigma with weight and being thin. When I've brought up the issue with him before, this is something he mentions. I'm not sure if this is just an excuse for him to not take it seriously or what.

He's a pretty picky water and what he does eat: chips, soda, chicken nuggets, fries, cookies, etc., he eats very little of. He's always been thin in seeing photos of him when he was younger, childhood through now college, and his family encourages eating (his siblings are in a healthy weight range, as well as his parents). 

I don't necessarily want him to even change but just simply he checked out at the doctors by a professional to make sure everything is okay. Although he is thin/underweight, what you put into your body has effects on your system and organs overtime, and I'm worried about him causing serious damage from malnutrition in the long run. Like I mentioned, I've voiced my concerns to him multiple times but nothing has been done about it at all and I'm not really sure what I should do...any help would be appreciated

TLDR: My boyfriend (5'11, 23 years old, 110lbs) is underweight and I'm worried about malnutrition and him having health issues later in the future."
relationship_advice,My (27m) GF's (23f) Ex (26m),"When my GF broke things off with her ex they remained good friends. I knew this early in the relationship and I told her I was fine with it, but didn't have any desire to get to know the guy myself. This was fine for years, they did their own thing on occasion, I didn't hear much about it, everyone was happy. 
 
Recently she's been pushing me to meet him. Her point of view is that he's her best friend and she wants me to know her best friend, and that she'd like for all of us to be able to hang out sometimes or him to come over. 
 
Mine is that I've no interest in getting to know the guy my girlfriend used to fuck and I've maintained that since the beginning. 
 
She will not drop it, and the next words out of my mouth are about to be that I'm done playing this game and not interested in maintaining this relationship if she can't respect my boundaries. 

I'm looking for a better way to go about this."
relationship_advice,"After a traumatic experience, husband (29M) and I (29M) have completely forgotten how to talk to each other. What do you do to keep the communication going in a relationship after that?","  

We’ve been together for a little over four years and underwent a lot of trauma in the middle of those years. I was raped by his boss, he relapsed with his drinking, we lost our job and our house, and we both turned inward instead of getting through it together. He kind of emotionally checked out and so did I, which created a huge rift in communication. Now we struggle to talk to each other about anything emotional or vulnerable. It’s like we totally forgot the language and its making everything else more distant between us too. I love him and I love my relationship, but my anxiety and fear of rejection is so great that I freeze up at the thought of going to my husband for help or I comfort. I feel like he is afraid too because he tends to run from deep conversations. I get frustrated because I wish he would be more direct and less afraid of intimacy, but I know that is unfair because I’m afraid and not direct either! 

I’ve drifted from my friends too and have had trouble making new ones, so it’s not just our marriage. After the rape I just lost so much confidence and safety and I faced a lot of scrutiny from close people. I hoped my relationship would be the one place where I was safe, but I felt like I had to pick up my boot straps and suppress all of my feelings at the time. Now it feels like I am emotionally freezing myself out of my own life because I don’t know how to stop and be vulnerable anymore.

How do I fix this? Anyone care to share what they do to keep emotional openness in a relationship? I’ve heard of couples scheduling days to talk and “check in” together and I am thinking about adopting this. I write letters to my husband discussing things I want to share with him, but it never leads anywhere because he doesn’t bring it up again and I’m too scared to take the initiative either.  We are both pretty avoidant people unfortunately, and our baggage together has made it worse. I know I need to go to therapy eventually, but in the time being, I am really trying to be proactive about what I can do in my relationship. Help!"
relationship_advice,Is my (28F) boyfriend (29M) manipulating me?,"We've been together 6 months and got pretty serious pretty fast. We've been talking about living together for several months, but not in extreme detail. However, we both agreed that we would when my lease was up in August. Yesterday he's over at my place and mentions that his lease renewal application came in the mail and he realized time had gotten away from him (as far as planning goes). He lives with his brother and they just moved in there last April. My boyfriend asks me, ""what do you think about Feb?""

I immediately took that as ""What do you think about moving in together in Feb?"" and that he was thinking along those lines. I'm immediately upset. This would put me in a bad position with my lease and I was frustrated he put what his brother recommended above consideration of burdens to me. His brother is a 28 year old grown up dude, he can surely find a place to live in August. 

My boyfriend thought I was overreacting and also tried to backtrack saying that ""he actually felt February was too long"" and he only put it out there because ""that's what he brother asked."" It makes me angry he would not advocate for what we'd discussed at all and give me the short of end the stick and then try to make me feel like I was overreacting.

On top of that, we had plans to see a movie this weekend and do some day trips, but then last night (a Thursday) he said his dad is coming in town and taking him and his brother up to a cabin for the weekend. I get he wants to spend time with his dad, but it ruined my weekend plans when I could have made other plans.

I feel very emotional about things right now and I can't think as clearly as I would like, can someone provide some perspective here?"
relationship_advice,I [27M] am getting increasingly sexually frustrated with my fiancée [26F],"For several months now, our sex life has been gradually declining. It's nobody's fault, but it's still bothering me and I was wondering if it's worth bringing up with her.

This all started when she began a new job last year that she absolutely hates with every fiber of her being. She comes home from work every day pretty well mentally and emotionally exhausted. I understand this, and so don't ask anything of her. If she wants to nap, I let her. Pretty much anything she needs to do to relax and recharge, I'm game with. She's having a hard time and I want to support her through it. God knows she's been there for me enough times.

On top of this, she is also dealing with endometriosis, so PIV sex is pretty consistently painful for her. I'm absolutely open to alternative, ideally less painful things, but in addition to regular sex being painful she thinks any other type of stimulation she could give me would be weird, gross, or too painful.

For the last few months we'd had sex about once a week. Generally on a weekend, after she was able to sleep in and recharge a bit. This weekly occurrence was pretty much the same every time, I do all the work while she lays there and asks me to make it quick.

Yesterday I got out of the shower after a workout and she started to tease me a bit. She told me that we had too much to do at the moment to do something then, but she would do something for me later. Later, we get all of our chores and errands done, and she is now too tired to do what she said she would earlier. This has become a bit of a running theme in our relationship. We get a bit in the mood and she tells me we'll do something later, then when later comes there's some excuse not to.

Last night she also told me that she hates that sex feels like it's becoming a chore for her that she has to do when she's not necessarily in the mood for it. I commented on the fact that we'd only been doing it once a week, so that must mean she's never in the mood. She kind of hesitantly agreed.

She told me that when she can leave this job, which will be in the summer, she'll be in a much better mood and our sex life can go back to what it was. Specifically, she said three times a week! I responded with excitement, but honestly, it feels like that exact same running theme to me. Telling me that we will definitely do it later, just for another excuse to come up. 

Last week when we woke up she told me she had a dream where she kept trying to initiate sex with me and I kept shooting her down. She told me about how it made her feel frustrated and unattractive. I was hoping she could connect the dots to see that's how she's been making me feel, but no such luck. I've told her that being shot down constantly makes me feel unattractive, and telling her that made her upset - crying at the fact that she feels like she's disappointing me. I quickly reassure her that she's not disappointing me, and I was just feeling insecure and wanted validation.

Honestly, I've been lying to her. I've told her time and time again that I totally understand and it's fine, but inside I'm kind of scared shitless that in a few years I'm going to be posting on /r/deadbedrooms. I want sex to be a part of our relationship. 

What I don't want, however, is to just add more shit to her plate unnecessarily. I want to be her rock. I want to help relieve her stress, not add to it. I told her before that if we can never have sex again, I'd be disappointed but would still marry her in a heartbeat. That is still true.

So I honestly don't know if I should really open a dialogue with her about how what is happening is bothering me, or just trust that things will go back to normal after she leaves her job. I feel like I'm stuck between being selfish by really wanting to address it with her or being dishonest by telling her it doesn't bother me that much."
relationship_advice,I [19f] want to support my boyfriend [18m] who is adopted but I am unsure on how to do so,"My [19f] boyfriend [18m] has mixed feelings about his past which haunts him during his bad days. Recently, he felt jealous after seeing his best friend’s younger brother, reminding him of his own younger brother who was adopted by another family.

He thinks that it’s stupid that he’s feeling jealous, and that he’s been crying every night for a week about this. I’m unsure of what are the right words to say to him, but I really want to help.

His mother used to be his foster family’s helper, but his mother became pregnant with him and his younger brother. She didn’t have the means to raise her children, so she had him adopted by the family she’s working for, and his younger brother, to a different family. He doesn’t have any contact of his bro or his bro’s foster family. He was too young and clueless to remember anything. Years later, he found out that his mother died giving birth. 

Sometimes he’d apologize to me for dealing with his problems (he refers as “bs”) every time, which then I’d respond to by reassuring him that I don’t see any of these as a nuisance. I really genuinely want to help him, but here’s another thing. Sometimes I’d have trouble in expressing my support for him, as I personally have my own problems I’m also having trouble dealing with. I’m really lost, I don’t know the right words to tell nor do I have the emotional capacity to deal with all that’s happening. We’re also in a long distance relationship, which makes it incredibly hard for the both of us in many aspects, especially in communication. How can I help him and myself in times like these?"
relationship_advice,My wife (26f) does not want to go to any of my (27m) extended family events,"She is a recent immigrant here, been here less than two months. English isn't the best, but can get around. 

She is willing to sometimes go out to immediate family events with my parents and brother, but not any extended family or any events with a large crowd. She has been to one big extended family event a few years ago when she was just visiting, but it didn't turn out so well for her personally. She said that there was too many foreign languages going on (I'm an ethnic minority) like English and the language my family speaks and that she can't really understand any or most of it. So at the last and only large family event that she went to, she barely ate anything and came home crying due to missing her own family and not feeling comfortable. 

How do I get her to go to my extended family events? It's usually like 30 people minimum. They are all dying to meet my wife again as most of my family is super outgoing and she is reserved and an introvert - as am I since I usually also don't go to these things besides from big things like anniversary of immigrating to the U.S.

Do I just give it time?

TLDR; foreign wife who is a shy introvert by nature and does not have the best English does not want to attend any extended family events because she says she can't understand what they are saying and gets easily flustered because of that."
relationship_advice,Reciprocity or quid pro quo?,"My (32m) now ex (27f) has me very confused.

We were together off and on for 3 years. Very chaotic time, but I love her very much. 

This past year she was very avoidant. One foot in, one foot out. She would tell me she loves me, wants to marry me, I'm the love of her life,however, when I'd say ""okay let's officially commit to each other and be together"" she'd say she's too busy for a relationship. 

This didn't stop her from accepting gifts and money from me. I paid a semester of her tuition because she's broke. I took us to LA. I recently paid for a spa day for her birthday. 

I was going to take us to Hawaii in February, but I started thinking ""I'm not getting anything out of this relationship anymore."" I don't get emotional or physical affection from her anymore. She doesn't do things for me. She'll SAY the things I want to hear but not do anything to show she loves me.It's only gotten worse. I started to feel like a sugar daddy and not a partner. 

After talking to friends and my therapist I set a boundary: commit to me, or I'm going to Hawaii alone. And I'll exit your life because I want a relationship and you obviously don't. 

She got mad at me. Hated that I said I get nothing out of our dynamic anymore. She called me an incel. And that I'm pissed off and angry that I'm doing things for her and expecting sex in return and making our relationship a transaction.

That hurt a lot. And confused me a lot. I genuinely love her. But I honestly have not been getting anything from the relationship for a long time. It's only gotten worse. She disagrees. I told her she's not obligated to be with me, but I'm not obligated to stay in our current situation that I don't like.

Am I wrong? Is this asking for reciprocity wrong? I just need some signal from her that she cares about me. Or am I doing a quid pro quo like a bitchy incel?"
relationship_advice,I have a bf but I have feelings for another guy.,So this is a very complicated situation and I'm not sure what to do. I've been in a long distance relationship (ldr) for over 2 years but we still haven't met in person. My bf and I have been having some problems the last year. Well recently I've started having feelings for my one friend. But my friend is in a really hard spot right now in his life and shouldn't be dealing with this as well. I honestly don't know what to do.
relationship_advice,Having bad dreams about Fiancé.,"This is going to sound so stupid. But for about a month now, I’ve been having bad dreams about my fiancé. Dreams where he’s cheating on me or just acting totally out of the ordinary; making mean comments/insulting me, they’ve all felt so real. I can see that it’s taking a toll on our relationship. When he gets off work and he comes home, I just shut down. I’ll answer him with only a couple words and I have a bit of an attitude towards him. I don’t know what to do about this. Should I tell him about them?"
relationship_advice,My boyfriend [23M] and I [F22] broke up mostly because of my depression and I need help coping,"We dated for about 9 months total, and we broke up last night. It’s barely starting to hit me this morning since we usually text each other good wishes for the day. My depression started soon after we started dating and sadly its only gotten worse. I could see how my depression was taking a toll on him and on our relationship, and he was starting to resent me. I was taking medication, talking to friends and family, and doing a lot of make my depression better but in the end I think it was too late. I really blame myself for the relationship ending since I know that my depression was the main cause of conflict in our relationship. Even though the breakup was mutual, I cant help but feel like if I would have been better or not had depression, this would have never happened. He is the most amazing guy, and I am just disappointed that this had to end. Being honest, I’m still learning healthy ways to cope with my depression and to be able to have healthy relationships when going through it (since it can really cloud my judgement and perception of things/people). I feel like I tried my best to make myself better but I think I didnt do it fast enough. I am not sure now how to manage depression and the heartbreak of my relationship ending all at the same time. Any tips/advice/words of knowledge would be appreciated. 

I also want to say that I have no hard feelings for my ex boyfriend and he tried really hard to make things work with me. Hes a great guy."
relationship_advice,Should you ever tell the person that you like that you're jealous of her other interactions?,"I've been talking with my crush for a few months now. We both agreed we are only friends.. she has a boyfriend but lately shes been doing some possibly shady stuff with another guy and it's been filling me with irrational rage.

I hate that I cant drop it and I hate that I'm feeling like one of those classic ""nice guys"". I dont think she owes me anything, but when she gives flirty undivided attention to this guy my blood just starts to boil. It seems like shes giving in to his disrespectful behavior towards her existing relationship. Shes even gotten jokingly mad at someone for ""cockblocking"" her when she has been flirting with him. 

Its really putting a strain on our friendship and I just dont know what to do. I'm dangerously close to ghosting because of the mental toll it's taking on me (keeping me up at night), but I feel like she deserves more than that?"
relationship_advice,My (25F) bf (25M) and I struggling with our sex life.,"Hi, Reddit. I wanted to post this anonymously and get some advice and perspective because I am having trouble sorting things out in my head. This is going to be a long one so I appreciate you all reading this.

Basically to start off, I feel undesired and that there is a lack of effort on my partner’s part regarding sex. He doesn’t hardly ever instigate sex, he doesn’t engage much in foreplay, and I’ve told him things I like but he doesn’t try them. I've told him simple things like I love having my neck kissed, but he doesn't do it unless I specifically ask for it. He also has a hard time staying hard and finishing during sex and he also watches porn and masturbates sometimes multiple times a day. The biggest issue right now is the fact that he has a difficult time staying hard during sex and this came up after attempting to have sex last night after not having it for three weeks due to my period and not feeling well the weeks prior. I asked him if he would be willing to cut those things down to see if it would help him staying hard and he eventually agreed, but we first had a disagreement about it with him coming at me about my masturbating and porn usage which I had already initially agreed to try and cut down on as well so he wouldn’t be doing all of this alone. He said that I masturbated everyday and didn't always cum so he didn't see how it was any different for him. I told him that me not cumming isn't dependent upon us having sex, but him staying hard is. I know that sounds hypocritical and that's why I told him I would be willing to cut back too if he was because that's only fair. 

Once this initial conversation was over, we didn’t talk much and I asked him what he was thinking and he brought up the fact that maybe we should change things up with our sex. This hurt me as it made me feel that he was saying the fact that he couldn’t stay hard was because of our sex life. He has always said it wasn’t about me or us, but saying something like that feels personal and like it is. He has never expressed these feelings to me before so it kind of blindsided me. I try to keep our sex life interesting for this very reason. I feel like I give great bjs and I try to give them often. Sometimes I’ll have him watch porn while I give him a bj and I am generally pretty kinky when it comes to sex, but this made me feel like him not being able to stay hard was related to me.

 I know that I am definitely taking this way too personally but I had this same exact issue happen with a boyfriend in the past and we ended up breaking up. After the past bf broke up with me, he told me a month later that he had felt less attracted to me because I had gained weight and his lack of attraction is one of the things that led him to feel bored and uninterested in the relationship and helped lead to the breakup. I want to note with that I had only put on 10 lbs and I was maybe 160 as a 5’5 woman. I wasn’t huge by any means. This has really stuck with me in new relationships. I guess hearing all of this I am going down the rabbit hole assuming it means the same thing that it did with my old bf. And it hurt to hear that after all the effort I feel like I put in trying to keep things fresh and mostly being the one that instigates any of our sex that he was feeling like it was routine. This is a fair point because we do a lot of the same things but it just hurt. I’m just having a hard time sorting out my feelings about this. I know I’m being sensitive and reacting to things that have happened in the past and projecting it, but I also feel very unsexy and not desired by him and his lack of effort contributes to that. Am I in the wrong for feeling upset here? I'm not upset about the fact that he said our sex life was routine, but I am more upset at the fact that I feel like there is generally a lack of effort on his part and this would obviously contribute to the monotony of things. I'm just confused and can't sort out what needs to happen here and how to fix it. We otherwise have a great relationship and when the sex works it is awesome too. I'm super attracted to him and I have always thought he was to me as well so this is really the only issue we're having."
relationship_advice,Separation advice,"So finally, after several years of what some people ugh call ‘mental abuse’ my (37) wife (34) have agreed to separate. 

We’ve agreed that I will have custody of our son but she will still see him. She offered that, I didn’t have to fight for custody. 

She is looking for her own place now and it’s all fairly amicable. 

My question is, having been in a relationship with her for the last decade, what am I likely to experience now that I’m gonna be a single dad?

Thoughts and lived experiences most welcome."
relationship_advice,I’m 29 (f) my bf 30. We are in a LDR and have been together for 1yr 6months. I’ve never met my bf family. Is this a red flag ?,"My bf and live in two different countries. We have the privilege of seeing each other ever months sometimes we every two months. Over the past year in a half we have really gotten to know a lot about each other. One thing that I’ve learnt is that he is very close with his family.

Here is my concern. My bf lives 15 minutes from his mom’s house ( his sisters lives with his mom too). 

We are 1year 6 months into our relationship, I felt like he would have taken me to meet them by now. Every time I ask him he would tell me that is mom is at work or his sisters is out of town. I told him that we could do a quick video call but he never agrees to it.  At this point I don’t even know if they know about me because he never let us talk on the phone. 

I’ve met a few of his friends but that’s because we ran into them at the store.

I’m starting to feel like he is keeping me a secret or keeping a secret away from me. Am I over thinking the situation? Should I be patient or is this a huge red flag."
relationship_advice,Ruining my 25f relationship with bf 25m due to past issues,"We have been together for only 5 months but I love my boyfriend a lot. He hasn't done anything to make me doubt him but i cant shake the insecurities from past relationships. I know 5 months is ridiculously short but no one has ever treated me the way he does. He said he isnt my ex and it is unfair to compare them. Im scared i might drive him away so really need tips on how to tune out bad thoughts.

tl;dr relationship with bf might be ruined due to past experiences"
relationship_advice,Is he confused or lying?,"My bf and I (both 32) have been together for 3.5 years. I have talked about wanting a baby for the whole relationship and he never comments but would sometimes randomly  talk about the things he would teach his future kid.  he told me he doesnt want to have a child he had valid points and I respect that but im hurt that he waited so long to tell me because i think i would have moved on quick. So we are moving out our apartment and staying in different households with family for short time. Yesterday on the phone he said we had to discuss somethings before moving in together and i was surprised because all month i have been looking and sending him profiles, he also shared with me. So i said okay and thats when the baby talk came up. Now im confused because today he called me and asked what is our new price range for places because we both want more space. We also talked about other wants like washer/dryer. This morning I asked him was he moving on from the relationship once we move in with our family and he said, “you know im not going no where” So for one im confused on why he hasnt thought about me wanting to move on to someone who will guarantee to start a family ( this is totally not what i want because i love this man deeply and cant picture myself moving on) and does this mean be might just be scared to have a child but may come to senses later on. He did say if it happened unexpectedly he would be okay but its definitely not what he wants.  He also said from the things i share with him about my family he does not want to have a child born into that. i explained i tell him because i know i know he will agree with me but not judge my family but i guess he was.  
Also his ex messaged him to send condolences for kobe Bryants death because he’s his fav player and they have been messaging ever since on social media. They followed each other again and we had an agreement to not communicate with ex’s and i recently had him unfollow her so its crazy for him to think its okay."
relationship_advice,Getting Married and fiancé can’t keep it up,"Hi there. I am on mobile, so I apologize for the poor formatting. 

I am not one to really post anything, but this is something I would rather get advice from strangers than anyone I know. Mainly, because I know it’s embarrassing for him. We have been together a year and a half and are great in every other aspect except the bedroom. I know he doesn’t see an issue, but that’s because he doesn’t want to talk about it. We are almost 30, so we aren’t super young. He just proposed to me not too long ago, and this is the only thing that makes me unhappy. I know he will be a wonderful husband and father. He treats me amazing, and I know sex isn’t everything, but it is important. It has been good in the beginning, but 9/10 times he can’t keep it up if the sex goes longer than 5-10 minutes. It’s not that he ejaculates quickly, it’s just he just can’t keep it up. I have tried to do different things like get lingerie or attempt different techniques. It doesn’t work. He denies it, but as a female, it makes me insecure like he’s not attracted. I feel like things will get better once we are done with school and other stressors, but it’s kinda been like this since the beginning, so it’s bothering more and more. I don’t even think of cheating on him with anyone, but I crave really good sex that I haven’t had in so long and that makes me feel guilty."
relationship_advice,Should I (26F) let 5 year relationship with boyfriend (27M) go over my cat?,"My friend recently asked me to move in and I finally brought my cat over. He told me I needed to disapline him (he smacks his cat really hard in the face if he does something he doesn't like). He said I need to disapline him if he jumps on the table. I posted a similar post on another thread. My dilemma now, is do I compromise and lock my cat in a room to live for the rest of his life so he doesn't potentially break somethung of my boyfriend's? I can't keep him from getting on the counters so this is the only way boyfriend would be happy. I'm seeing an ugly side to boyfriend that I'm not liking. When i noticed my cat was locked in room the other day, he told me it was because my cat his cat. But he keeps letting them near each other when I asked him not to just yet. And when I told him I asked him not to do that, he said and your cat keeps getting on the counter and table. I mentioned that maybe he could clean the table and keep expensive personal belongings out of common areas. He went on about how he's not going to turn his house into a cat tree and turn his life upside down for a cat. He told me I turned my back on him during the conversation like I was going to let my cat out of the room when he told me not to. I think I was just upset about his comment about turning his life upside now and I was leaving the room. He said in disrespectful of him for turning my back on him and disobeying what he told me. He said I don't ""respect his stuff"" because he said I used the word ""junk"" when describing the stuff on the table. I feel like he's choosing his stuff over me. He buys so much stuff and probably has 100k dollars worth of items and supplies for his hobby and it's spread everywhere in the house. I told him if we have kids I'm not going to smack my kid for tripping over his $600 model that he left carelessly in the common areas. And how will I ever teach my kids to be clean and neat and put their stuff away if he wont. I told him so many times before I moved in that I wanted the kitchen counters and table clean so that I can cook and eat at the table. There's no where to live with all the stuff and I'm offended that cleaning is ""turning his life upside down"".

TL;DR should I let this relationship go? Is he being selfish or should I lock my cat in a room like he does with his? He says I need to disapline my cat, but to him that means hitting cat very hard on the face where it makes a loud sound., not just clapping my hands and saying no or using a squirt bottle."
relationship_advice,"Me [23F] with boyfriend [24M] years of issues building up, completely lost","Hi

&amp;#x200B;

We have kind of a unique situation. We got together when we were both 15 in high school, so we've been together for nearly 8 years now. As an aside, I had an extremely abusive childhood and had never experienced a functional relationship with anyone. I was very very independent and uber focused on getting myself out of my home town. I knew the way to do that was through education, so I threw myself into it. I've had a lot of therapists tell me that it's kind of a miracle I came out of that situation as a functional person. Sometimes I think it's because there's something wrong with me. I really think a normal person should have been more fucked up after my childhood. I don't think I'm a sociopath (mostly because I know that I love my boyfriend so much), but I think I might have some sort of autism or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I was in academics and very driven, he was in lower levels and way less driven, (came from a better-off background, parents who didn't really push him.) but I felt like I could trust him no matter what, and he was one of the first people I ever really opened up to. I felt like I could tell him anything and he just accepted and loved me no matter what. I never had that before.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a university and moved away, he was still living with his parents. At the beginning of my third year of university he applied to a college in the town I was in, and we moved in together. It was OK at first, we were really happy to be starting our lives together. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've been living together for just over 3 years now and I really think our relationship has degraded. He's always had severe depression and only recently started to get treatment for it. We have this dynamic where I do everything- EVERYTHING. He's depressed about having the same job after graduation, about feeling like there's nothing to look forward to, he doesn't cook, clean, plan dates, even remember to feed the cat most of the time. I reconnected with family in my new town who have been really supportive to me, but he really dislikes them because they're very go-go like me, and he says it makes him anxious. He doesn't have his driver's lesson and doesn't seem interested in taking lessons, despite us being in a country where you pretty much need to learn to drive because public transit is so poor, and many jobs want you to have a licence. He pretty much just goes to work, comes home, and goes on the computer where he has a server on a game that he makes pixel art for. His other hobby there is roleplaying. He does this for hours every day, it's his only hobby, and he's openly admitted that he uses it as an escape from real life. If I suggest that this is unhealthy or that he should limit himself, he accuses me of trying to control him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have anxiety myself and I've recently felt closer and closer to a breakdown as the realities of my current life sink in. Having to be responsible and on the lookout for two people all of the time. Having to take care of two people. Having to worry about how unhealthy he is (poor diet in terms of not eating enough food, no exercise, regularly complains he feels ill and weak) When I envision out future together as things are going right now, I envision a woman who does everything, who takes care of the kids, who bears the entire mental load while juggling an aggressive career, and I resent him for it. I know I can't force him to change. I keep trying to make plans for us to do stuff to get healthier TOGETHER, but they fall apart because he will get to a point where if I encourage something (hey, let's go to the gym today!) but he doesn't want to, and I push it, (no really, let's go!) he gets all hostile and will start swearing or call me names, or refuse to do chores, or withdraws into himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing is the name calling. He has called me a lot of names, always in anger. It feels so awful to have the person you've spent 7 years with look you straight in the eyes and tell you to eat shit. I know I  shouldn't put up with it, and I don't, I get really angry and then we have a huge fight, which nearly always ends with me crying and him being sorry, or us breaking up and not talking for two days until I come back and talk us through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really think moving in together was a mistake, because he has never had a chance to live on his own. That's obviously unfair to him. He didn't really protest against it when we first did move in together, but I understand now that just because I was ready doesn't mean that WE were ready. At the same time, I am scared that if I leave, he will fail. He will fall further into depression or completely isolate himself, seeing as I'm pretty much the only person he sees outside of his job. I love him and I don't want him to fail. It's gotten to the point where he's exploded at me when I had my sister over and she ate some of his chocolate eggs (which he got for free and he could get more for free, I know it was wrong of her but he overreacted), he said it was a massive disrespect of his property and I was allowing my shitty family to abuse him.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know why I'm here. It's so obvious to me that I'm in a dysfunctional relationship where I'm co-dependent on him and enable him to continue being an adult baby, not to mention all the verbal abuse. I have an anxious attachment to him as well and am hyper-attuned to his moods. I know I'm shitty for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are reasons that breaking up would be very hard. The first is that my dad LOVES him. I think my dad might honestly disown me if I broke up with him. Me and my dad are very unalike as people, but my dad was very supportive of my decision to go to university and financially supported me even when he was struggling himself. I know I will disappoint him if I break up with my boyfriend. The next reason is that his family has been really great to me. I honestly love his mother like she was my own. My own mother was awful. The third is that our city has recently experienced a rental boom. I might afford to live on my own since I was lucky to get a good job straight out of uni, but it would cripple my ability to pay my student loans off quickly. He cannot afford to move out, he might be able to manage staying in our current apartment but it could mean dipping into his savings. When we had a fight on Tuesday and I told him he should just move out (like I've said, I'm not blameless in being an asshole to him) he said he can't, he would just have to quit his job and call his mom to come pick him up so he could move back him hours away from here. That would be career suicide for him, and he was always miserable living in his mom's basement. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. We decided to try and give it another go, but I have a sinking feeling about it both ways: staying or breaking up. Both seem like equally bad options. Everyone thinks we have such a great relationship. I love him so much. I have always loved him. Even when we fight, and when we say those awful things, (like me saying that he doesn't deserve me, which I bet does wonders for his self esteem. I really hate myself.) I can't stay mad. I always come back and talk us through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've never been to couples counselling. I know that's an option and we should do it. I also know that he has always been an unmotivated person, and I might have to face the fact that it's not just mental illness, it's his personality, and can I live with having to goad someone into doing the basics of their every day. (there's other stuff I haven't disclosed, but basically he has another issue giving me massive anxiety that will take him years to sort out and he hasn't been on doing it and I don't know if I can trust him to be on top of it, but every time I think about it I feel sick.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's me. I feel like my entire life is shit and like I'm at a crossroads completely lost and I don't know how to go forward. I've thought about me moving out but us 'staying together' but haven't discussed it because I am unsure of the financial viability of that course. I think we will get couples counselling because we have to, although that in itself is expensive and will worsen the financial situation if it ends up we should break up and move out. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr, years of issues have built up and I feel lost / unable to determine the best direction going forward. He is a bad partner but I love him to pieces and I don't want him to fail. I also want to be clear that he is a good person. It's impossible to paint a complete picture of him from what I've written, but he is really at heart a good, funny, clever person who is deeply depressed and lost in the fog himself. I really don't want anyone to bash him here. We have issues but I am shitty as well."
relationship_advice,My ex-girlfriend [F18] and I [M18] have been on a break (due to her family member falling ill) for over a month now. How is the best way to start talking to her again?,We left it on good grounds and on the basis that she needs time to spend with her family. She was visually depressed at the time of the breakup but has recently been much happier and seems just like when I first started going out with her. We haven’t spoke in over a month (and with Valentine’s Day coming) up I want to do something to try and fix the situation as it’s all I can think about. What is the best way to go about doing this?
relationship_advice,What to believe??,"My spouse has recently starting going to therapy. He admitted to me that for most of our marriage, he has been doing whatever he thinks will make me happy. (Conversely, he often does what he DOESN’T want to do.) He goes along to get along. 

He hasn’t yet given me tangible examples. But in the meantime, I am paralyzed by indecisiveness when we make plans now. I don’t know if he truly WANTS to do what’s on the agenda or not. I feel terrible. I also feel like I’ve been an inadvertent bully all these years, although I know this isn’t a fair assessment . I’m not pushy or bossy. I always ask his opinion. And if his wants differ from my own, I don’t throw a fit. In fact, we hardly ever fight....which his therapist says is a true sign of the fact that my hubby just gives in all the time. 

We were trying to make plans for a date night and I had suggested somewhere to go after dinner. And he said ok, but we’d have to change his dinner reservation to an earlier time to make it work, possibly having to go somewhere else to eat. So then, I didn’t know if he WANTED to change the reservation or if he WANTED to go somewhere after dinner. I (gently) voiced my concern, and he got mad and hung up. What do I DO?!????  I feel like I’ve been lied to for 28 years."
relationship_advice,I resent my partner.. but do not want to.,"I (23f) have been with my partner for 7 months. He has changed immensely since the beginning 4 months together. In part I can credit this to a new job &amp; moving. However, he has changed so much in this time. 

He has grown cold, uninvolved, mean, angry, and beginning to demonstrate some precursors to emotional abuse. 

I have talked to him many times regarding things &amp; there has been no change. He has become unrecognizable. I broke up with him, and it caused him to have a tremendous break down. 

We talked about what wasn’t working for the both of us and what needed to change. I see him trying some of the things I told him needed to change... however I resent him. I want to try and not give up but I look at him and feel such anger and resentment and sadness. I know he’s a wonderful person and I am still so in love with him and want things to work. 

Has anyone been in a situation similar and can offer some advice? Thank you!"
relationship_advice,I'm (21M) breaking up with a great partner (19F) since I'm no longer interested. What do I say?,"Hello everyone -

I (21M) been seeing someone (19F) for about 3-4 months now. We have similar values and some oddly similar tastes, and up to this point have had lots of healthy and open communication. We put effort into understanding eachother's needs and regularly spending time together.

However, I'm not attracted to her and hanging out now feels like I have to rather than want to. I initially thought that being attracted to her didn't matter and that with more time I'd want to hang out more, but as of now *hanging out and having sex just feels forced*. 

Everyone says honesty is best when breaking up with someone - how do I tell her this? Or would it be appropriate to just say ""I got what I wanted from this, thank you but I'm done now""?

relationship_advice,Is she interested or wut,"Girl interested or not?

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn’t slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don’t understand if she’s losing interest shouldn’t she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I’m deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I’m going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I’m just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?"
relationship_advice,"I 29(m) am feeling a strong desire to settle down and I have met the perfect woman 22(f), but I am afraid to tell her about my past because she is so innocent. What should I do?","A little background about her, she is 22(f), never went to college, but instead worked for a non-profit from the time she graduated high-school and is still working there. She has only had a few sexual experiences with an ex-boyfriend who got creepy after getting sexual. Her desire is to be a stay at home mom, and that is exactly what I want!

About me, I am 29(M), I had an early sexual experience at the age of 12, and have been sexually active every sense. I have already graduated college and am in a pretty stable profession. I own a house, a rental house and some property that I am planning on building a house on. I never really wanted to 'settle down' until I met her. I have built up a lifestyle and relationships all around me that are just for convenience sex. I have sex with a 2 of my co-workers multiple times a week, I have a weekend girlfriend who just sort of shows up at the house on most Friday night and stays until Saturday. We met on Tinder, and her only request was that we don't talk about her life. I have been very open with everyone about my sexuality and lack of desire to settle down until I met my dream girl 22(f) 3 months ago. 

She is really into having a traditional relationship and wants to take it slow, which I totally respect and want. I already own a house and I feel like this is a perfect match, but I have this whole other life happening that I haven't told her about and I would assume I would have to end the sexual relationships I have been in. I am actually terrified to tell her about my past. I have always been pretty open with everyone, but most of the women I have been with, we met with the same intentions, NSA sex. It makes being honest easy. I think she deserves the truth so she can make a decision, but I am terrified she is going to run away. We haven't had sex yet, we have only been on a few dates and I just don't want to get super attached to her if she is going to not accept what all I have been into. How do I tell her? I don't want to pressure her into accepting me, because that creates resentment later on, but I really like her."
relationship_advice,I don’t love my boyfriend Anymore.,"I’m a 29 year old female and I’ve been with my boyfriend (male, 33) for about 6 years. We met in high school and I was in love with him, we’ve been through so much. We moved in together 2 years ago and I work as a financial accountant and he owns his own store. 

Lately I’ve been feeling different though, I’m not feeling fulfilled and he has begun to bore me. Everything’s becoming somewhat routine and I am not exactly happy anymore. I even feel like I’m losing my sexual attraction to him and I never really want to have sex. We barely go on dates and when he’s home he plays video games and talks to his friends all day. 

I have never cheated on him even though I’m very attracted to one of my co workers. He texts me and is always saying that if I was his, he would show me the world. Whenever I talk to my boyfriend about traveling he doesn’t take the topic seriously. I’m just bored with my relationship now and I don’t know what to do. 

Not sure if I should end it. I’m definitely not going to cheat on him, I would rather end it, just not 100% if I want to. He’s an amazing guy otherwise. 

TL:DR- getting bored with my relationship and not sure what to do!"
relationship_advice,I'm a toxic friend and I need to better myself,"So, I'm not sure if I need therapy or what, but I'm just gonna lay down what I've doing the past few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I get large bursts of emotion, I bring it onto other people, and since I'm in high school and I'm going through puberty, everything is way out of order. I get random fits of anger, sadness, and arrogance that just come and go as they please, and I take them out on people close to me, mainly my, possibly ex-best friend. I had a full on just emotional break in first period today, and I just ran around the room for a minute before just walking out, and as soon as my friend came to talk to me I yelled at her to shut up and stop blaming herself for everything since I'm the problem and that my life doesn't revolve around her and that I wanted her to leave me alone. Now we were just arguing about my behavior and I'm getting yelled at for ""pitying myself"" by saying I'm what's wrong with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I help better myself? What do I need to do?"
relationship_advice,I (24F) want to breakup with my BF (29M) but am not sure,"So I’ve been dating my bf for 3 months now. Already met his family and he met mine, which now I believe it was kind of rushed. Anyways. He’s 29, graduated from college 1 year ago and is unemployed. Also he is still living with his parents. He says that he is taking online courses and is not prepared for job hunting, but still... he hasn’t applied for any job positions. I’m not really attracted to him physically right now. He’s very short and a bit fat. Sometimes he really pisses me off doing stupid things, like singing too loud and doing ridiculous impressions. But 1 month ago I was really into him!!! Don’t know what happened. But of course, he has good things... good sense of humor, likes the same stuff I do, sex is relatively great...  so, what do you think? Should I wait some more time and see if it gets better or should I break up with him already? And if so, how do I do this??? Knowing he likes me so much... thanks in advance"
relationship_advice,How do I get my girlfriend to stop spending money on me?,"For background, we’re both in college, she’s a sophomore (F19) and I’m a freshman(M18). I have a somewhat big scholarship and I commute, so I’m not at all in the same financial position as her. I can afford to buy her things and I do often. She, on the other hand, came from a somewhat rough upbringing and sometimes struggles to pay bills. Regardless of this, she’s always buying me dinner or little gifts that I know are going to hurt her at the end of the month. The problem is that she doesn’t want me to think she’s poor, and that’s what she assumes I’m doing when I tell her to stop buying me things. I don’t think she is, but I’m also reasonable enough to see that I shouldn’t be a top priority financially. How do I ask her to stop buying me things without offending her?"
relationship_advice,[ThrowRA] I dont feel worthy of what I have,"So this is a throwaway because I dont feel comfortable sharing on my main account, but everything is pretty simple. So basically Im in a relationship with the girl I always liked, but now I dont feel like I deserv it. Not like I did something wrong or anything, I just think im not enough for her. I dont think im at her level is what I wanna say. Neither in looks, personality or whatever. I dont expect much of this post really, just kinda wanted to vent out, but if you have any advice I will be grateful."
relationship_advice,My (21f) brother (m24) made a decision and I'm really proud of him. How do I show this?,"So there are a few layers to this. My brother is 24 and decided he's ready to go to counseling. An absolutely huge step on his part and something he's feared for quite some time. 

I'm really proud of him, but it's a struggle to show this beyond simply saying it because I live 2 provinces away from him. We're both in Canada. I also dont want to necessarily buy him anything because he's used to showing affection through money. I want to do something that makes him feel good and reminds him that he's worth more than he realizes. 

We've been through a lot together and I really just want him to know that while I've always got his back, he's strong and capable of taking on the world on his own too. I thought about those lovebooks where you make your own story, but felt weird doing something meant for couples ya know?

So reddit, any suggestions?"
relationship_advice,How to get harmless attention from other women while in a relationship?,"This is probably going to sound horrible but bear with me. Been in current relationship for going on 5 years, we’re very happy but sometimes I find myself wanting confirmation that “I still got it”. 

I’m a decent looking guy in my 20s (6ft+, muscles, tattoos), and i used to get attention from women quite often while out with friends. But I’ve turned into a bit of a home body lately, me and my girlfriend work a lot and would rather spend our time together, so obviously this doesn’t happen nearly as much. This might sound dumb and insecure, but I miss that feeling of someone else thinking I’m attractive. 

My girlfriend is beautiful and has guys in her DMs on a regular basis, and I can only imagine what dudes say to her when I’m not around. Sometimes I let this bother me, and get jealous because i almost feel like it puts a chip on her shoulder, that if things didn’t work out between us she would find another guy with ease. As shallow as this all sounds, I wish I had that same power over her. 

So my question is, what can I do to feed my insecurities and remind myself that I’m still a decent looking guy that other women would want to be with? 

TL:DR - I have a hot girlfriend that frequently gets hit on, want to show her I’m still a desirable prospect to other women and make myself feel better."
relationship_advice,My boyfriend (22M) hid a friendship with a married women (23F) from me. This women and her husband just broke up within the last week. Am I (22F) crazy for believing that my boyfriend has something to do with this???,"I had always looked at my boyfriend with glowing eyes and my love for someone had never been stronger. Paranoia of the possibility of him cheating on me, emotionally or physically, has gotten the best of me over the past 3 weeks after I found out he had kept a friendship hidden with another women from me. My loving side has faded into darkness, every night I struggle to rid the anxiety and he has to reassure me that he isn't interested in her - however, I don't believe this. 

**Background on the hidden friendship:**  
He left his Facebook logged in on my laptop, and I snooped. Yes, that was wrong of me. Anyway, I saw that there had been messages from this women. She is 23 and has a 2 year old baby with her husband. My bf and her were good friends in high school about 5 years ago and have only reconnected in the last 6 months or so. Their messages contained things from her such as ""Are you keen to go to this gig tonight at 'x location'? x"" and ""Hey are you free for coffee? x"" and ""\*photo of two cocktails\* Cheers x"" (which according to him they didn't have together). There was also a message saying ""Hey I'm taking \*baby's name\* into town, was thinking we could go for a walk, get coffee maybe go to the museum? x"" and them agreeing to this, then her saying ""I'm outside your house."" This is when I realised that they have obviously met up beforehand since he did not mention his address and that messages have been deleted.

**The same day they had a walk together I went over to my boyfriend's house after work in the evening. I complimented him because I noticed he was wearing nice tidy clothes, and he just said thanks. He did not mention he had been out with a friend during the day**. I snooped about 5 days later and this is when I discovered he had been hanging out with this women. I panicked. I wondered anxiously about why he had been hiding it from me, and why he had gotten all dressed up from her. 

Immediately I spoke to him about it and he has admitted to hanging out with her twice but only for a walk. He said that she speaks to him about positive things about her relationship with the husband and that he speaks about me too. **He did panic a bit when I asked if the husband knew who he was and that his wife had been seeing him.** His reasoning for not telling me about the friendship was that apparently he knew I would get insecure about it and thought it wasn't worth it. 

However, within the last few days this women and her husband have changed their relationship statuses on Facebook. This makes me believe that my boyfriend is lying about her talking positively about her relationship. But on the other hand, I want to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt and believe that maybe very recently the women's relationship with the husband has gone sour and that it has nothing to do with it. 

**I'm highly analytical. I need someone who isn't insecure about things to read this and tell me what the fuck is going on.** Am I nuts?? Is there any other information you would like? 

What next step shall I take? Should I talk to him and tell him I've noticed that this women and her husband are no longer together, and that it concerns me? Or shall I let it pan out and see if he mentions it to me?

TL-DR; Boyfriend could of contributed to the break up of a husband and wife, and I feel like I'm being gaslighted and that he's lying. I want to believe him but something feels off. He has lied about their friendship to me and I had to snoop to find out. Am I nuts? 

\*Not throwaway\*"
relationship_advice,Am I wrong for being annoyed at my wife for having dinner with another man?,"I (28M) have been married to my wife (24F) for about 4 years now. We're best friends, and we love each other. 

Over the past few months, my wife has been having quite bad anxiety and depression. We've been talking about it quite a bit, and I've been as loving, supportive and understanding as I can be. One of the things she noted was that she really feels like she needs a support network among friends, and that she feels like a lot of her friendships are a lot more valuable and deep, since she feels like they're quite superficial now. She used to have a close family network, but she moved country and has lost that, so it's understandable.

However, one of the people she has chosen to become closer with is a guy called Rob. To be frank, I don't like Rob. Rob is insecure, to the level where she has shouted and argued at me before for ""questioning"" his expertise at a board game, by disagreeing with his outlook on the game. He constantly mocks me, and projects his insecurities on me - an example being that he is a window cleaner (not a bad job), but he received an economics degree, and he constantly tells me I need to ""get a better job"", and I need to ""achieve my potential"".

My wife knows I don't like him. This is, to be fair, probably aided by the fact that when we initially met, my wife expressed that in a strange way, she finds him attractive. 

I've told her that he annoys me, and I don't feel comfortable around him. She has been spending more and more time with him. I've told her how uncomfortable I am about all of this, and that while I understand she will probably not cheat on me, I feel she may be having an emotional affair. She has, basically, dismissed me, and told me that I'm being a bit ridiculous. I've not told her she can't meet with Rob - I just told her that I feel uncomfortable with how much time she's spending with him, and that I don't like him.

I work for the emergency services, so I work long days (8am to 6pm). Today, we were talking, and she told me how she won't make dinner for me tonight, because she's going to Rob's house, because he offered to cook for her. 

I have issues with this:

1) I don't like Rob.

2) Dinner is when my wife and I usually sit, talk and bond. I feel like she's choosing to miss this out.

3) I don't get cooked dinner. When she's working and I'm home, I cook for us....

4) I don't get to see my wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I understand she needs a network. And I understand I might be being a bit insecure with all of this. But I can just see this turning into an affair.

So on the phone call, I told her how uncomfortable I am with the fact that we won't only not be having dinner together, but she'll be having dinner with another man, and that man is Rob. She told me to not be like that, and hung up.

Am I wrong in this situation?"
relationship_advice,Do I have to consult my bf about my financial decisions?,"Title basically says it all but in detail; I am running out of time to make a decision about my car. I can either trade it in or have it repossessed. I want to avoid repossession. My boyfriend keeps telling me to wait and wait and wait but I am running out of time. If my car gets repossessed it will be 1000x more difficult to get another car. 

Do I have to consult him anymore about this? My anxiety is through the roof the more I think about it. 

Also I should mention he pays none of my bills. We do live together he pays rent and I pay utilities and my own bills."

relationship_advice,Losing patience with my husband’s performance anxiety,"My husband is wonderful in every way. He is kind to me and always wants to make sure I’m content. Our sex life leading up to the past few months was fine, but the performance anxiety took over his thinking when it came to penetration. 

We have talk openly and endlessly about it. His problem is very simple: overthinking. I’ve consistently been patient, understanding, and reassured him that I don’t judge him and we can take things slower if need be. But he says he just needs to think less.

He’s fully aware of the problem and knows what he needs to do to solve it. But he still overthinks when it comes to sex. 

He is definitely not cheating, he is not watching pornography, and he does not have any reason to overthink because I never judge him for anything.  

I’ve only said kind and genuine things to him but it doesn’t seem to make any difference what I say or do. I ask if there’s anything I can help with, he says no and he just needs to think less. 

I am absolutely fed up. I’ve tried being patient, I’ve reassured him and encourage him in every aspect but it makes no difference. He knows what he needs to do but it doesn’t seem to work for him. Again, we have talked openly about this but we still run into this issue. 
Im frustrated, but have not expressed anger towards him because I know it’ll only make things worse. 

Anyone else have had similar issue and found a working solution?"
relationship_advice,"My boyfriend rarely ever has sex with me and tells me it’s because his body is “broken” What does that even mean?

I’m 20(F) and I’ve been with my boyfriend for over two years and our sex life has become nothing...
I have asked him for sex and I’ve tried to initiate it, but he will turn it down because he says he’s too tired or his body is broken? What does that even mean?? 

The only time we do have sex is when HE wants to, and it’s mainly at night to help him sleep better. 

what sucks even more is he doesn’t do foreplay or even lets me finish without tossing over when he’s done and going to sleep:( 

Im young and I enjoy sex but I don’t get any, I would never cheat but I’ve fantasized about having sex with someone els...I feel guilty but I also feel annoyed and sexually frustrated. 

If someone could please give me advice or their opinion to why my boyfriend doesn’t feel in the mood half the time to have sex it would be appreciated. Both guys and girls opinions please:)"
relationship_advice,I (17M) keep dozing off on my girlfriend (18) when we're chatting.,"As some pretext to this, we've been dating for almost 2 years (anniversary in a few days). The relationship is an LDR so you know an online presence is important. There this recurring problem of me dozing off on her while chatting. First few months of the relationship, she would understand that I was just tired and things like that but I've been increasingly made aware that this isn't a desirable aspect.

Only after being at her breaking point, I did decide to change, or at least try. I have this rubber band always around my wrist which I would stretch and release to make me wake up at least a bit more (Yes, like what Velma did to Shaggy to stop Shaggy from saying ""Zoinks"" or want a scooby snack). I tried to fix my habit of not saying ""I'm sleepy"" through that method. I just wanted to talk as long as possible though which ends in me just sleeping.

We've agreed to sleep on set times for weekends since we have school so those days are alright but the weekends are the problem. For weekends, I do my best to stay up since I know she wants to keep chatting. No matter what I do, use the rubber band, sit-up, even slap myself I just can't seem to stay up or remind myself that I should say that I was sleepy. There were times that I did managed to say that I was sleepy but those just resulted in her getting agitated due to the fact that we couldn't talk much of the day.

How can I manage to change my habits of not putting my foot down if I want to sleep?"
relationship_advice,Boyfriend never wants to go out because of money issues and it is driving me mad.,"Hi reddit. 
I was wondering if posting here would be a good idea... I might delete this soon after. 

I think I have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend, we're both in our late 20s, live together with a dog and plan to buy a house later. 

Everything is pretty smooth sailing here but the main problem is money. We get both minimum wages, and money is a bit tight for him. He still has to pay a good deal of his car credit debt every month and he's barely able to avoid negative numbers on his bank account. 
I do better and can afford to buy things during the month. 

We are not the partying type and are avid gamers, so our free time is spent inside. 
Both our jobs are pretty stressful right now, so it impacts our time together and nerves add up to arguments and rows. 

What I am getting at is that I ( a girl ) am getting tired of spending my free time doing nothing at home all days. We didn't even left for vacations as no one is able to secure a stable job for long since the last 2 years. So it means staying inside, doing nothing else to risk spending more money.
He doesn't mind that as much as me, but it is eating me inside.
 I feel like I'm stuck in the same routine, work-sleep-eat, and that we will never be able to go somewhere else, because of the house project, the vacations never spent together and because he doesn't want spend money to go out ( I often pay for take out and restaurants, or else we wouldn't do anything at all). 
It's like I'm stuck in this spiral of stressed related topics ( work, house, money issues ) and I spent way too much time crying in self pity lately.

He knows all of this, but the answer remains that if he had money, he could take me out more and we could go somewhere else to take our mind of our daily problems.

It is a small issue that is becoming way too relevant, and I am feeling lost and isolated. I also don't have many friends to hang out with

I love him and don't want to break up with him, but I don't know how to change things. He seems aware of what I stated above,  but I also don't know if he truly appreciate the problem here.
What should I do to feel happier and make him understand the situation?"
relationship_advice,My boyfriend is throwing tantrums when I talk about my emotions/problems,"Hey everyone, I'm 21 and my boyfriend is 23, we have a very long complicated past in which we were in a long distance relationship. We broke up twice for a long time, once was for 3 months and the other was for 9 months, in both he was the one to break up with me and was also the one to rekindle the relationship.

Throughout the time we haven't been together and also when we have been together, he has done a lot of things to hurt me. Those things were were never solved because either he lied till I caught him on a lie or because he gave me ultimatum that I forget about the past or we break up.
Currently he recognizes my emotions and talks about things I bring up briefly until at one point he grows too anxious and upset. 

Example 1:
When we just got back together after 9 months and I asked him if he ever talked about me to anyone he bragged about how everytime he opened up about me to people, he used to tell them: ""one boob of her's is big enough for two hands of mine"" he says it was a joke to diffuse the heavy atmosphere and that it's a compliment, but I think about it everyonce in a while and feel really disgusting and disrespected.
I probably brought it up 3 times in the last half a year but he is upset at how many times will we need to talk about it, and throws a tantrum at how I never get over things.

Example 2:
When we just got back together he told me he used to smoke a lot of weed, do mushrooms and acid and that it isn't much of a big deal for him.
I told him that I respect that but I dont want those things in my life, he said he can give up on anything but he still wants to smoke weed quite regularly, we agreed on a compromise of 3 times a week, since he has lied to me about smoking weed in the past and asked me to ""tell him to stop cause he is addicted and he will do anything for me"". He pretended to stop but smoked and also broke up with me because of his unhealthy consuming to escape reality I am very insecure about this topic.
I told him that I'm okay with him smoking in that consistency but that I don't feel like smoking with him, I opened up to him later after a lot of pressure from him to 'how long will it take it's already been two months' and started smoking with him everyonce in a while.
After that I feel like he started wanting more and he started throwing to the air things about how he wishes he could do mushrooms again, and how he misses the spiritual journeys he had on acid, I told him I feel uncomfortable with what he is saying and asked if he wants to do it again, he said that he feels like I censor him and that he wants to do it but won't because of me, when I tell him that if he wants to do it he most likely will do it again, and I most likely will never be okay with it. he said, ""In relationships you sacrifice things, also maybe it will be you that will change your opinion and not me.""
It has been a reaccuring thing.

Example 3:
I asked for a massage from him, I've been sick and my muscles have been sore I've also asked him to rub my butt a little (nothing sexual in this regard it just feels good to me), he got turned on (understandably) while he massaged me and initiated sex, he gets really insecure when I'm not in the mood for any reason and although I wasnt too much in the mood I understood him and felt guilty cause I seduced him to some extent by asking for massage.
Right before we got into it, he said that last night when we had sex he thought he heard me saying another guy's name that's started with M (long story short he has been jealous about a coworker that has a girlfriend and we arent even that close to each other that his name starts with an M). 
I didn't say anything because I was quite shocked (I for sure didnt say his name it was just paranoia) and also because he just went right in but I was quite disturbed, it was my fault for not saying but at one point he noticed and stopped and he got mad that I didn't tell him so badly and threw a tantrum.

In general whenever I try to talk about troubles of the past either he tries a little sometimes, or he doesnt try at all saying he is tired or he wants to chill, or we discussed on something heavy today it is consistent. I will not deny that sometimes I get triggered multiple times a day, but I never come in an angered way always in a vulnerable and understating way, he almost never knows what to say beside ""I understand"" ""I don't remember anymore"" or ""I have nothing to say, but you want me to say something"" he almost always gets anxious and unless I convince him I'm completely fine he throws a tantrum. sometimes even if I try to reassure him he also does.
what do I mean by a tantrum or anger of his?
most of the time his tantrums include him pulling on his hairs, hitting his head and legs with objects or hands, reaping his shirts/socks/necklaces or so, him laying on the cold floor, or just shutting down completely at the best case for a long time.
We never finish to talk about those things afterwards, cause if we will he will throw a tantrum again. Till not too long ago either I would've lost my shit too and after some time start crying hysterically, try to stop himself from hitting himself and feel sorry for him, in rare cases I'm ashamed ton say I hurt myself as well after he did from stress (I never used to do it).

Today is the second day I left while he threw in tantrum telling him that if I'm staying I'm validating his behavior and it is not my worth, I feel extremely guilty but I also feel like it's not okay that my emotions aren't dealth with like that.
I told him that if we get into a relationship again he can't repress my emotions and that I have a lot of scars we need to deal with it.
He says my pain and his are not the same, and that its tougher on him, I think it's the opposite.

That's why I'm coming to you guys..
How can I deal with his tantrums better?
How can I deal with my insecurities? It seems like there are million and that they never get solved.
I would like to get some general advice and criticism on me as well, do I do something wrong can improve my way in a way or another? Be able to deal with it on my own without involving him?
Thank you for all of you that will answer, I truly do love him I just dont want to be treated that way anymore."

She said she really hopes we can be friends but she doesnt have the same feelings

- one thing i dont understand is: Remember when i told you she said she wanted a boyfriend and someone to love? and call him and say she loves him?

So i dont understand why she rejected me when i am fun to talk with

- She saw a random guy with muscles in gym class, i saw her face she fell in LOVE"
relationship_advice,relationship advice,"My girlfriend (Well ex atm) were together for 1 year. I was her first boyfriend and I was wary of this when we started dating. A year in and she ghosted me for two weeks and then came back wanting to be together. He later told me she may have caught something from someone she slept with when we broke up. Obviously I was very. upset about this and were not together at the moment. but...

\- she broke up with me because she felt he couldn't offer me anything at the time

\- she has changed a lot since the break up (gotten a new car, promotion at work, saving up for a house)

\- she has been here for me since she came backthis is the main point for me as her leaving me out in the cold has opened a lot of childhood wounds up for me. But in all honesty she has been really supportive and always was when we was initially together.Ive gone through the motions and im starting to feel better again. Do you think I should get back together with her based of what I have said here? Or do you think she is likely to let me down again or is a bad fit? or that I should just let it go? I do love her a lot (I guess otherwise I wouldn't be writing on here) and I don't feel this way often at all"
relationship_advice,My bf is still talking to his ex and it bothers me,So we have been dating for 2 months now and everything has been amazing and all. At the beginning he kept talking about his ex and I made it clear that it bothers me. The problem is one time we were having a disagreement on something and he called me her name. He explained to me that he remembered about all the times they were fighting and it wasn't his intention to call me like that. He said he is 100% over her and that I shouldn't be concerned. It made me feel like crap and he noticed that. He felt really bad and deleted his ex on every social media. But today she texted him again talking about whatever drama she had in my life. I understand that they stayed friends or whatever but she was his first love and they dated for 2 years and they broke up because she cheated and lied not because he didnt have feelings for her. Am I right to be bothered by this or should I just let it go? I'm scared I'm going to get hurt. In the past I have been involved with some guy that was not over his ex and I felt used and stupid. I dont want to ever feel like that again.
relationship_advice,What to do in the rough times.,"Me (26 m) and my fiancé (26f) have been struggling lately. And I’ve found myself riddled with anxiety and just the general depression feelings.

It’s a long story but lately I have felt like things have changed. In the past I always felt like I was her number 1 priority. Lately it hasn’t felt that way to me. 

Two nights ago we had an argument over Instagram. I had caught her logging out of a profile that I didn’t know about. She explained the reasoning for it to post her poetry anonymously which makes sense because she’s shy about it. I asked to see it and it didn’t have any posts or activity. The only thing that popped up on it was a search for ex boyfriend. She said she was talking about ex’s with her girlfriend and she wanted to see what he looked like. He had her blocked on her regular profile so she used her poetry one to show her. This is all justifiable and makes sense but it’s just more worrying to me that I didn’t know about the profile and she didn’t mention that the first time I asked. 

Anyways, fast forward to yesterday she wrote me this long letter about her feelings which made me feel a lot better. I saw it when I got home from work. She was working at the time. I wrote her one back to give to her when she got home from work. She told me she was clocking out and having a drink. She works at a resteraunt so when she gets a drink it’s 30-40 mins tops. Last night she was gone for 2 hours. She texted me a couple times and I was trying to give her space and not ask what’s taking so long but it bothered me. She ended up coming home pretty drunk. I recently started a job and only get to see her 4 hours a night usually on the weekdays. I think that’s what hurt most. She was saying how she was drinking and telling and listening to stories and lost track of time. Last night she worked from 4:45-8:20 when she texted me. So I’ve been putting in long days and all I want to do is spend some quality time with her and I guess I was hoping or expecting her to want to spend time with me. I get that she wanted a drink and I’d totally be fine with that. But it just turned into her being gone for 2 hours then showing up drunk. So we couldn’t talk about the relationship and I felt like she’d rather be out getting drunk that be with me. I feel like saying I lost track of time is just a way of saying I don’t think about you or the relationship enough. And she was saying how much she missed me all day when she came home. That really bothered me. In my head I was thinking if you really missed me that much than why sacrifice our time together.

TL;DR
Used to feel like a priority in the relationship and something has changed. 

What do I do?"

relationship_advice,At-Fault accident; husband seems distant,"TLDR- I was at fault in an accident and my husband has been kind but withdrawn since it happened- worried he is resentful that I wasn’t be safe enough. 

The other day I was alone in the car when another driver illegally crossed the HOV lane a car or two head of me, causing a chain-reaction type accident. However, I was the last one involved and rear-ended the car ahead of me.  No one was seriously injured, but I was cited for failure to stop my vehicle in a reasonable time (nothing else- no speeding/distracted/impaired/etc as of yet) The insurance claim is still going through and whatnot, but I will be the first to admit that I definitely feel like the asshole here and look back a lot- it happened so fast- but I am happy to be compensated with my life. I suspect that I will be found 50% or above at fault and to my understanding of the state’s law I will not be entitled to compensation if this is the case. 

Husband came to get me from the parking lot where I was towed from the highway, but he got lost on the way and was flustered when he got to me. We were very amicable but he was so flustered he couldn’t remember how to put his seats down.  He took the first day off with me and has been very attentive, even after going back to work.  We have a very happy and healthy relationship with open communication. 

However, he has been distant, irritable, and snappy since getting home from the incident. He says he is getting sick but I know him.  I’ve apologized directly for frightening him and for not paying as close attention as I could have. In the past he has helped me manage my phone while driving because he wants me to stay safe, and I worry that he is feeling like I wasn’t listening to him or taking him seriously enough. I feel extremely guilty about this as even though I was able to see the accident before it happened, I wonder still if there was anything else I could have done beforehand (gotten my breaks checked? Put my phone IN my purse instead of on top of it? Taken the back roads instead of the freeway? Who can say....) I’ve also directly asked if something is wrong after a particularly sarcastic comment, which he denied and again said that he was getting sick. 

In any case, I understand that these feelings for both mid us are natural reactions to stress and trauma. I also think he is really stressed about how it will affect our insurance policy. We don’t have kids and my car was a salvage title and a total loss, and since I’m not counting on insurance due to my fault, we are probably going to be taking a direct hit here. We have a joint savings we both contribute to and I have a little money set aside in my savings and budget for an incident such as this. We also have another car and even a parent’s car that we can use instead of a rental. It will definitely impact our finances, but we are fortunate enough to be secure enough to make it through. 

Still, I feel like shit about the situation and am worried this increase in our policy could be a monthly reminder of how I fucked up. To be clear, we are both very happy and grateful that I am mostly unhurt and are trying to remain positive, but I am unsure as to how to navigate this emotional journey.  

Any advice would be appreciated."
relationship_advice,Should I get over them?,So me and my friend both like each other and we said it to each other. But he doesn’t want to date. So is there any point to us liking each other? It just seems like we just said I like you and then went on with our lives and nothing happened.
relationship_advice,I (26F) am a csa survivor and am having issues with my (25M) boyfriend,"As the title states, I’m a csa survivor with what I’m sure is an understandably difficult family history. My father’s side of the family abused the current generation, notably with filming sexual assault and distributing it. I am no longer in contact with my family and am safe, as are the others I am aware of.

I did a lot of work in therapy to work through my trauma, but I think some of it will just stick around. Unfortunately, porn is pretty triggering for me and I can’t really stomach the system that creates it. My boyfriend is of course pretty into it. I recently discovered that he is also into actual nudes girls post and not just actors.

I know it’s a natural impulse to look, but it makes me feel so sick. I feel so hurt by him looking at actual girls and disgusted by some of what he’s into. Our sex life was terrible for a while and I tried to have open communication about it but he never opened up. Finding out that it’s because he was looking at girls I’ll never look like cuts pretty deep and only adds to the feelings of disgust.

I’ve tried talking to him to explain why it hurts but I don’t think I’ve gotten anywhere. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar position or even if not words of advice. 

Sorry if this is scattered, I’m not in a great headspace right now. Let me know if you need clarification."
relationship_advice,Am I (28F) overthinking this issue my boyfriend (31M)'s dogs?,"Hello. I would like to ask for your advice on this issue I've been feeling towards my boyfriend's dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I would like to ask for your understanding that since I'm not a pet owner, I might not be able to see things in his or a dog person's point of view, but by all means I do respect dogs and their owner. I'm just unsure if what I feel is unreasonable and I need to cast it away for the better good, or it is normal.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has 2 female poodles and they're like babies to him. He would cook their food himself, sleep hugging them, getting up in the middle of the night just to help them pee and poo on the training pad, walk them everyday... He's an awesome dog owner, and a sweet, responsible, loving man. The dogs are good girls, but for me they're a bit too spoiled.

&amp;#x200B;

We're in LDR for now until I'm finished with my work. Sometimes when I come to visit him, I would stay in the hotel and sometimes at his apt. It bothers me though that when I stay at his, the dogs would always sleep in between us. He would place them somewhere else on the bed if I asked, but the dogs always get back between us until I give up, and he doesn't seem to mind them sleeping in between. I don't feel comfortable at all whenever they licked all over his face and lips then kiss me, or especially when he mouth-feeding them. When we have sex, he would try to shut them out of the room in the beginning but since they keep whining and clawing at the door, he'd give up and let them in.

Those times that I stay at the hotel, if he can't ask his friend to look after them he wouldn't stay over with me. We barely have 3 hours together per day even though my days were limited. I did talk with him about this one day, asking that I flew over 10,000 miles and took my days off just for him, and yet he can't stay with me because he doesn't want to leave the dogs home overnight? That I don't understand. He told me the dogs would be lonely at home, and they only have 5 or 6 more years with him, while we have our whole life ahead. (On his defense, he does try to get off work early for me when possible, and did take a few days off for me. But still, he wouldn't leave the dogs alone overnight without somebody to look after them, even if I have to leave in a day or two).

&amp;#x200B;

He does try to accommodate me, but the dogs would always try to have their way and eventually he would just let them. I know that they've been with him (5 years) way longer than he's been with me (8 months), and I know that I might be too demanding, so I tried to convince myself that I would get over it but as it accumulates, it's becoming harder to swallow. Now when we video call and I see him kissing the dogs every 5 minutes, I even feel jealousy building up. (I would never give ultimatum me or your dogs, that would be too cruel for him, that I know)

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know though, if I'm too demanding and I shouldn't feel this way? Should I try to compromise? Should I try to talk this out? But I worry that if I tell him these, I might offend him, considering how much he loves his girls. I can't know as I'm not a pet owner or a dog person.

&amp;#x200B;

I would very much appreciate your input. Thank you muchly in advance!"
relationship_advice,"My wife (35F) and I (35M) were approached by another woman (36F) to go out on a date, but it’s but us in a bind. What do we do?","Last week my wife and I randomly got in touch with an old acquaintance we hadn’t seen in years.  It might be a little bit of a stretch to call her a friend, but we knew her in local professional circles and had hung out a few times at random meetups and such.  We always enjoyed her company and thought she was pretty cool.

She has moved to another town now a few hours drive away, but one we visit every few months or so.  To our surprise, she mentioned to us both in a message that she’d started to see other women and couples and asked if we’d like to go on a date with her.

Now to back up for a moment.  My wife and I have had one or two of these kinds of things happen before and while it’s nothing that we actively seek out, it’s not something that we usually turn down when it happens.  Thing is, it hasn’t happened in a few years now because we’ve had bad luck and a dry spell.  The itch has cropped us for us both.

Now back to the woman who asked us out.  She flatly told us that she’s married and her husband doesn’t know.

Yikes, right?  So now we’re in a predicament.  We’re heavily leaning towards saying no thanks because of that obvious complication.  But also do we just keep this to ourselves?  Anyone got any advice for this situation?"
relationship_advice,"Many of my wife's friends are men, some of them having had a sexual past. I'm uncomfortable with the situations she visits them in.","My wife and I (30m, 28f) currently live 100 miles from where we grew up for work, so we have few friends. She sometimes drives back down to hometown to visit friends in situations that are making me more and more uncomfortable. Recently she went to a strip club with a couple she had a threesome with about a year before we got together. (She only interacted with the girl, but all of them were in bed naked together). She told me she wouldn't drink much or show any skin, as in the past she'd let strippers parade her around topples. (She is a very beautiful, curvy woman). However, she later told me she did let the girls show her off and then slept over at the couple's house, where nothing happened but they all cuddled on the couch. 

Moving forward to now, she's recently met her brother's roommate (single, 20m) and decided he's her best friend, though they only communicate through snapchat. She's heading down for her brother's birthday and they are going out for drinks, along with his roommate and her ex, who she's looking forward to seeing, and has already made jokes about having sex with her. She plans on staying  overnight with her brother and his roommate, and has a somewhat sexy outfit picked out for the bar.

I've told her that all this does make me uncomfortable, and she says she won't go any more if I explicitly say so. I just don't want to be that guy. 

Am I just being insecure, or is my discomfort in these friends and situations justified?"
relationship_advice,Relationship Advice,I recently got out of a relationship a few weeks ago and I was deeply in love and I was for sure never going to move on but she hurt my friends over my relationship so I started to hate her because she changed. I believe I’m over her now and I’ve tried talking to other people. Recently I started talking to a girl and it’s going pretty well and we’re pretty close like we’ve told eachother some pretty big secrets and we click if you get what I mean. I don’t wanna jump to conclusions if she doesn’t or does like me but we kinda flirt like I compliment her and she does it back sometimes. How do I tell if we’re just really good friends or if there’s a chance for something?
relationship_advice,I Love Him But What About Sex?,"I'm getting married soon to my boyfriend of many years. He's thoughtful, patient, kind, talented, driven - all the best words you could think of. He deserves the absolute best and thinks he's getting it in me, but for the past year I've been plagued by sexual thoughts and dreams about other men I know. I've never even gotten close to cheating - when a guy hits on me at a bar I make a weird face and scurry away - but I'm scared of where this is leading. I've found myself thinking about how a one-time affair *would* go, if I could even bring myself to it, etc. I guess the problem is I feel **loved** but not **desired***.* We don't have sex that frequently because he has a high-pressure job and when he's stressed he can't keep it up, which means he doesn't initiate as much, and, after too many disappointments where I've to console him, I don't either (and who's around to console me?). 

What are my options? What do I do? I want to spend my life with this man, but am I doomed to spend my life feeling like an undesirable wet bag, in a committed, lonely relationship with my vibrator, or cheat? Help me please."

How is that a fucking joke? I asked him “oh so you found these two girls who came up and just got naked for a picture then left?” There’s no fucking way. I said “what were you alll doing then playing cards like what the fuck were you doing??” He keeps insisting he didn’t sleep with them or do anything but there’s no way they came up for a picture then left.

relationship_advice,I need help creating boundaries with a classmate,"I (21F) am in my final year of my bachelor’s degree, but I’ve switched faculties a few times, so I don’t have any close friends in my program. I’ve made several acquaintances through group projects, but it wasn’t until 2 weeks ago that I finally made a friend (28M) that I’ve felt I can text and spend time with and work on homework with. We also have 3 classes together, so I see him almost every day. 

He’s a foreign student, so I’ve been trying to brush off the touching and compliments, but I feel like if I don’t address this, things could get out of hand. I also feel like he’s just using me for my smarts and my car. He lives about a mile away from campus, so he walks to and from class every day. He’s started asking me from drives everywhere: to school, the store, the mall, etc. I’m very bad at saying no to people, but I feel like I need to do something about this toxic “friendship”. It’s hard for me to justify not driving him home or to the store, because it’s on my way home, but it just seems like he’s relying on me too much. 

He’s also not very intelligent, so I also get the feeling that he’s using me for better grades. He plays stupid when we’re working on stuff together so I’ll do everything for him.

Please help me! Thanks!"
relationship_advice,"Help me (M23) choose, is (F21) she worth befriending ?"," (TL;DR) I had a long-distance thing with this lady before but now we're good friends lately she's been distant and isn't willing to open up. What can I do or say on the next call before completely giving up on this person? 

Alright, I had this young lady (F21) that I (M23) became real close with about a year ago. It was a long-distance thing but it fell apart because of the distance and my immaturity. We fell off for a whole summer, feeling guilty, I apologized and we were cool again. At that time I wasn't truly interested in getting back to how things were, in the beginning, I just felt that I cared for her and wanted to be cool. I received a drunk call from her days on from her. She was a bit seductive was saying a lot of naughty stuff, kind of like when we used to talk on the phone after we first met. I didn't give in and tried being formal on that call. A few days went by and she started to ignore me and became distant on DMs. I confronted her and she said she would really enjoy us just being friends and that she was still into me but because of distance we couldn't be a thing. Of course, I was fine with that.

Moving on a couple of months and I've been the ones initiating the conversations about almost anything from her achievements to even her art. I drank a little last night and went straight to the point. I asked again why she was being distant and not hitting me up. She noted that she's been like that lately with everyone and has been confronted by her other friends for it. she also said that she wasn't the type to reveal what she's going through. Reading that bugged me our because I thought to be friends was about understanding one another and trying to ease each other. I will also note that back when we were somewhat of a thing she spilled some beans about taking medication for depression. I was the only one that knew about that. Not her BFF and not even her family. I asked if we could get a phone call this weekend so we can discuss why she's been distant and why she doesn't wanna open up to me. I'm pretty sure if shes defensive over the call, I will start to be distant moving on forward. Meaning ill probably mute her on social media so I can move on with my life. What do you guys recommend I should do or say before this phone call?"
relationship_advice,"I (18F) agreed to date someone I don't have feelings for. I feel like I should end it, but I don't know how.","I am a 18 year old high school student. I've known this girl for almost three years and I've considered her my friend for about two. Since the very beginning she was very interested in dating me and has asked me out multiple times. I always told her no, for many reasons - I had a crush on someone else, I was going through a very difficult moment in life and didn't feel ready to date anyone, just wasn't interested. She always respected my choice.

In the last year she started texting me more frequently and we talked about our common interests a bit more. We became what I would consider very close friends and I was comfortable with that. I liked her. Then she asked me (over a text) if I would want to date her. I was a bit tipsy, I panicked, and I said yes. Even though, really, I didn't have feelings for her. I don't know exactly why I did it. I felt pressured, she has asked me so many times and I always said no, I didn't want to hurt her. I thought that maybe if we spent some more time together I would get to love her and be attracted to her.

But that didn't happen. It's been three weeks since we started dating and I'm just... Not feeling it. She texts me all kinds of stuff how she loves me and how amazing I am. I am flattered a lot, but I don't feel the same. She texted me ""I love you"" so many times that eventually I texted it back, but now I just feel like a scumbag, because I don't mean it.

We are not made for each other. We share common interests, true, but our personalities are vastly different and it doesn't feel right. Also, this may be a very miniscule detail to include, but: She is very loud. Almost constantly screaming or talking very very loudly. And I have sensitive hearing, to the point that my ears hurt when listening to her too long. It sounds harsh, but it's true.

She visited me two days ago and asked me if I wanted to kiss. I made the excuse that I didn't feel ready, when in reality I don't feel attracted to her and I don't want to kiss her. I felt so bad after this I was deflated the whole evening.

I'm also at a very difficult point in life, I'm crushed by schoolwork and family issues and I feel like I couldn't manage a relantionship right now even if it was with someone I truly loved.

I feel... Really bad. Really shitty. I lied to her. I thought I could love her, but I can't, and now I feel like a horrible person. I don't know how much longer I will able to lie to her and myself like this. This whole situation is my fault and I accept it.

How do I break up with her in a gentle way? She told me about her previous girlfriends and they all broke up with her after a week of dating. I don't want to hurt her, but I can't do this any longer. What do I say? How do I approach this? It's my first relationship and I already fucked up.

What should I do with this? How to end it?"

relationship_advice,Update on getting dumped and the angry texts that followed from her,"Posted here a few days ago and got an overwhelming response thanks to you all. In summary my ex dumped me and then expected me to go back begging, chasing and pleading. I did none of that despite my heart being well and truly shattered. She told me to pick my stuff up and I did immediately which resulted in her turning it back on me saying I couldn't wait to pick up my stuff and get out of her life. I've offered several times over the past week to talk to her but on each occasion she refused. Then she got mad saying I'd given up so easily. I still haven't blocked but have gone distant now. The texts continue mainly at night and I reply to some but only matter of fact and others I ignore. They are a mixture of blame for me and pity for herself but no offer of an apology or a recognisable of her own role. I'm coming round to the fact that this relationship is well and truly over. I'm not prepared to put myself out there for her anymore and despite the mixed messages I get from her keep contacting me it looks like she is unwilling to do anything either other than blame me. We had our ups and downs like any relationship but this came out of the blue to me if I'm honest. Is her contacting a sign she regrets or is she just trying to justify her actions by blaming me? Either way I can feel me moving through the stages now to recognise that her behaviour is childish and not really good long term for a sustainable relationship even if she came back asking for a reconciliation."

relationship_advice,My (21M) girlfriend (21F) wants to give up on intimacy with me,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4+ years now, we’re very committed to each other and we plan on getting married when we’re done with school. However, throughout our relationship, intimacy has been a problem and it’s reached a point where I’m scared I’ll lose her.
Both me and my girlfriend have never dated anyone else and when we first started dating we moved kind of fast and became intimate somewhat early in the relationship. Ive never been super comfortable with expressing my sexuality. I had some self esteem issues in high school and for a while I thought I would die alone. This led me to just give up on love and stop looking at women in a sexual manner for a little while. But since my girlfriend and I started dating I’ve basically had the feeling of only being attracted to her, other women don’t interest me in any way. And I don’t say that in the “I’m committed to my girlfriend way” I just don’t see other women as attractive.
Anyway, Over time my girlfriend and I have been intimate less and less. She goes to college 2 hours from where I go to college so I only get to see her during the weekends. I still live with my parents and she stays over with me at their house often when I’m in in town. Sometimes when she stays over and we start to get intimate I get uncomfortable if my parents are at home, so we usually end up having sex when they’re both out of town, which isn’t often. This has led to some tension between us because I’m not really satisfying her and she already has self esteem issues. When I deny her intimacy i know it makes her feel terrible but sometimes I get uncomfortable to the point where I can’t even perform sex well and I can’t get it up. 
In addition to that sometimes she stays over at my apartment in college and it’s hard for me to be intimate there because the walls are thin and I get worried about making too much noise. I also get pretty badly depressed during school semesters so it’s hard for me to feel motivated to have any sort of intimacy. 
Over time it’s all added up and shes told me she wants me to admit I don’t want her. I still love her in every way but I know I’m not satisfying her. I feel like a complete asshole for doing this to my girlfriend, I’ve hurt her far too many times and I just want any advice on what I can do to increase my sex drive or make my girlfriend happy."
relationship_advice,husband (23m) is sabotaging my (23f) dreams,"(posted on r/advice as well)

First time poster here. I have been with my husband for going on three years. We are located in South Florida. One of our biggest arguments that has been occuring over and over again is my dream to be a music producer. He always makes me choose between him and music, but won’t let me chase both. He claims to be supportive, but I feel like he is just saying that to take away his guilt or whatever. I have traveled for music before and I tend to work with many different producers/artists (mostly are male, shocker). But, I always tell him who they are and what we are working on. I have never crossed a line or have done anything to betray his trust. I am very transparent due to the respect I have for him and us. But, since I work with men primarily, he still gets insecure. He inserts himself into the situation and basically asserts his dominance with these guys. Then, it gets awkward and they don’t want to work with me anymore. The amount of bridges he has burned in my network is infuriating. Today, I just learned he reached out to my graphic designer and now, my designer won’t even respond to me. I’m so upset about this. I want to share my success with him, but, in the end, I want my dreams to be MY own because music is so sacred to me. I don’t know what to do. This feels like an argument that will never end and it is truly hindering me from success. I’ve had this conversation so many times with him and it feels like this will never change. I’m miserable with constantly having to choose. Any advice on this? Or has anyone been in a similar situation?"

relationship_advice,Me (31m) ruined a relationship with trust issues with (26f),"Long story short I started dating this girl after meeting her online. Everything was going great, we clicked automatically we had the same interest, it was perfect and in my eyes she was perfect. Prior to her I was completely fucked around with my previous relationships, lying, cheating, etc. The real mindfuck was they never really showed any red flags.  My ex in question in this post never showed me once that I had to worry about trusting her, I thought I healed from my previous but clearly I didn't. We had a couple arguments about her needing me to change and I didn't because I couldn't control it. She tried everything to re assure me but it was like I was scared to trust her. I've been in quite of few relationships before but I never felt a love like hers and if it makes sense I was petrified of it. I was petrified that a person like this can really exist and that it was impossible. The one thing she needed the most I couldn't give that to her and that was trust.

Question. How have you guys gone about dealing with this. About helping youreselves come to terms that not everyone is the same and dealing with the trust issues. And has anyone had the same feelings as me of ""being scared of the love you felt"" ""and thinking it's impossible"" causing self sabotage. I lost this girl forever I know it, and she was the type of girl that you shouldn't let go. Now I'm worried that I will never come across a girl like her even though I don't deserve it."
relationship_advice,"How do you know when the honeymoon phase is over for you, but maybe not them?",[removed]
relationship_advice,How do I tell a girl who is always very interested in me that I can’t have a relationship with her?,"A bit of backstory first. I met her trough a friend and since the beginning we got along great. We went on a few dates that went down really well. We’ve been talking a lot in the past months and she made it very clear she wants to have a romantic relationship with me. We are both 18 yo girls who live in Brazil (sorry for any english error btw, it’s not my native language).

But there’s a few problems: 
1. I am moving to another country in a few months for university 
2. I don’t think we are compatible

I already told her about the first one and she said she wants to be with me until the last possible moment. The thing is that I do not want that. As I said I don’t think we are really compatible even tho the dates were really great. She is really clingy and is making things move VERY fast. And I feel kinda suffocated by that because I really need to have my own space. We don’t have a lot in common too.

I do not know how to voice those concerns tho. I don’t want to hurt her because I do like her a lot. Every time I try she gives excuses to why we should be together. For example, I told her that I thought things were moving too fast. She said that even tho she already considers herself as my gf, she will respect my time. In her point of view we are already dating, even tho we never discussed that. 

Our conversations lately have been really stale. At the begging things flowed better because we had a lot to talk about (who we were, what we liked, etc.). But now there’s not much to say because our interests and hobbies are so different. Most of our conversations at the moment are either small talk or just about sex. And that would be fine if she didn’t actually want a relationship with me.

I really want to tell her that I am not interested in a more serious relationship but she made it very clear that she wants me a lot. She said she thinks about me all the time and wants me more than anything. I do not want to hurt her because she’s a really nice person but this whole problem is making my anxiety worse than ever (I have anxiety issues). This is really messing with my mental health. What should I do?"
relationship_advice,I (23M) have an issue expressing myself to my very emotional gf (22F),"So we're in a few months long-distance relationship where we talk and play videogames everyday as neither of us works yet (I'm finishing my thesis and she will start college next year). We met 3 times by now and I invited her to stay over one night at which she agreed.

We got into quite some arguments by now because she doesn't feel good with herself because of things I did/said. These include me not looking at her and her body after we woke up (I'm a bit insecure and reserved so I subconsciously thought it would be ""inappropriate"" to look at her at that time, even after having sex that same night...stupid me) which made her feel unattractive and bad replies to some questions of her like ""do I smell good?   You don't smell badly(...)"".

I'm also not very spontaneous at complimenting, which hurts her even more sometimes, like at things other people compliment her but I don't.

These dumb attitudes make her feel bad with herself and make me feel awful and guilty for that. She's also really emotional so the smallest things really get to her easily and even after I explain them to her and try to make up for it, it's already too late.

I need help at expressing myself better and in a way that she can feel better about herself. Any advice is welcome and I'll reply to any question!"
relationship_advice,How do I (20F) tell my girlfriend (21F) of two and a half years that I’m dissatisfied in our relationship,"TL;DR I feel like a parent and not a partner to someone who has communication impediments and a lack of a personal drive.

So it took me awhile to formulate a way to write this. Let’s give it a go.

As the title says, I don’t know if I love my girlfriend as deeply as I did before. For some context, we started dating senior year in high school, and have been together since. We’ve know each other since 5th grade, and live in a very small rural farming town. We have virtually all the same interests and desires in life. I am her first relationship, and she is my second. We are both virgins. So basically, we’re still pretty new mentally, despite it being 2 years. 

Within the past year, I’ve had a lot of life altering events. My dad lost his job at 48 due to Parkinson’s Disease, I started college in a big city, I had several break downs in said college, my dad had a bad fall when I was gone, we lost our insurance and my new one doesn’t cover my medication, my grandma died, I was told I had to put my cat down, I withdrew from school after one semester, my friend tried killing himself, and now I’m on a hunt for a job so I’m not a complete waste of space for my family. 

During all this, my girlfriend came out to me as MTF trans. This in itself doesn’t bother me, as we are both bisexual and grew up around quite a large amount of queer kids for such a rural area. Even so, I felt like something in our dynamic shifted. Irrational as it sounds, I felt like I suddenly took on a more parental role than a partner role. I became more keenly aware of things she was failing to do, instead of focusing on positives, such as her lack of a drivers license and constant talk of applying to community college and internships yet failing to pursue either. Her day to day quirks are beginning to irritate me now too. She has a speech and writing impediment, making communication difficult at times. She’ll ask questions with noises and gestures-something that never really got to me before, but is now digging under my skin. I’ll find myself snapping and saying “use your words” sometimes. 

Sometimes I’ll vent to her and tell her some issues I’ve been having like couples do. I’m closed off, so this doesn’t happen often, but I feel like she doesn’t really get how deeply I am affected. This blame mostly lands on my shoulders, but when I am blatant, I feel like she doesn’t really get it. I had been having a situation where one of our mutual friends was touching me in ways I was uncomfortable, and I brought it up to her. He regularly did this to lots of his female friends, so it wasn’t exactly new. My girlfriend said she had noticed it (but she doesn’t experience it as she is not out publicly) and wanted to speak with him to stop him, because: “I don’t like him touching my girlfriend like that!” But, nothing happened. To my knowledge, she never said anything, and when it happens still she just kind of watches in discomfort. 

I know she’s an anxious person, and has issues communicating. But I feel like the burden of communicating is stuck on my shoulders. I feel like a parent all the time. I have to drive her when she wants to go out. Sometimes I have to drive her to and from work when her parents don’t. I feel like it’s my fault when she talks about how she gets stir crazy from being home all the time. I feel like I’m starting to resent her for it. I’m starting to realize I want someone who will take charge for once, instead of me. 

I don’t know what to do. I know couples have rough patches, but this feels like a rough mile. I’m in such a depressive slump. There’s no one I can turn to to speak about any of this. The only friends that live nearby is her and the grabby guy, and my brother is mildly transphobic and bad with advice. I’m supposed to be speaking to a psychiatrist for new medication to treat my severe depression and anxiety, but who knows when that will happen. I just feel lost.

Here’s the hard part. I’m horrible at deep and emotional conversation, but I know that’s what needs to happen. How to I talk about this without wrecking us both?"
relationship_advice,"Because of me(m27) Sex life is ruining relationship, pushing gf(f28) to breaking point","My gf is getting very frustrated recently at our sex life. , so am i. When we first started dating i had some ED mostly due to anxiety w a new partner, often happens with me. This passed quickly and we were having sex very often and it was great. Maybe 4-5 times a week. This was over a year ago. Since then, it has become much more sporadic, recently only 1-2 x a week, sometimes every other week. We have gone as long as over a month without sex and honestly it has not been good at all. There is so much stress and anxiety related to it. Whenever she doesn’t finish, she gets all pissed and wants nothing to do with me. I try offering other services after i finish , if she hasn’t yet, but she doesn’t seem interested. She is a very sexual person. I have been struggling recently with Pe, and its driving both of us crazy. This was never really a problem for me, i would be able to last a long time and sometimes not even finish. She gets pissed, shes unsatisfied, and indirectly makes me feel horrible about it and embarrassed and ashamed. I never had pe problems before until about 2 months ago. I attribute it to having all this anxiety about sex and focusing on trying to get her off, and last longer. Also the fact that we have sex way less frequently, makes me think that is prt of the reason why i come so much faster, idk. I tried telling her that i think if we do it more , it will probably get better, but most times i try to initiate she is not interested, and i feel worse about it. I don’t know what to do. She says she now avoids sex with me bc she feels worse after when she cant come and gets distracted and it ruins her ability to get work done and focus. I hate the fact that sec has become this awful cycle for us. It really used to be great, satisfying, and fun for us both. Now its a stressful event that brings out so much anxiety for us and frustration.  I have struggled with some anxiety and depression before, and this recent bout if pe affecting mu relationship is really not helping at all. My gf said she has just about had it and cant keep going on feeling this way. She needs sex. I do too. She mentioned something about “scratching the itch” somewhere else, and now i’m worried she’s going to cheat or leave me. Is there any way to save this and fix this and get back to out old selves?"
relationship_advice,I (21M) am extremely jealous.,"I have issues being jealous practically my entire life, every time I'm in a relationship I get jealous over stupid stuff and some relationships ended due to that. I am now in a great relationship and feel like I can trust my gf completely however I still have doubt and even jealousy over almost everything, I never show it nor talk about it as I know it's stupid however I want to ask if theres any way possible for me to change or do something about this jealousy?"

I have a hard time knowing what she means by that and I don’t really know what to do next to take our relation further. Should I just talk to her on the phone for a while and later ask if she wants to hang out?
Hard to know when I’m taking it too slow or too fast. Because I don’t want the feelings to die off just because nothing happens and I don’t want to stress it."
relationship_advice,Bath bomb versus Bubble bar?,"So my gf (19) and I haven't been dating very long, but valentine's day is coming up. We aren't going to see each other until afterward, so we agreed not to make a big deal of it. However, as a courtesy, I was planning on buying her a both bomb, based on the fact that I know she bathes and will appreciate it.

However, confusion arose when I went on to Lush and was introduced to the idea of a bubble bar. I tried looking into the two, and unsurprisingly only found positive descriptions of them. I also looked for reviews from people who have used them, and unsurprisingly found it differs from person to person.

So now I'm looking for ways to figure out whether my gf would prefer the have a bath bomb or a bubble bar, without just straight asking her, as I want it to be a surprise."
relationship_advice,I hate my girlfriend's dogs,"I (36m) have been dating my girlfriend (26) for about 8 months now, we've known each other for about 2 years.  She has 5 dogs and IMO they're starting to effect our relationship.


Don't get me wrong, dogs are great but it's impossible to cuddle at her house because they're big dogs and they want to get on the couch with us. They take up tons of her free time and she prefers going to her house because she doesn't like leaving them alone. I also question how much it costs her to feed these big dogs. They seem to be well behaved and her house is always clean but I have a lot of expensive stuff and I'm not sure if we lived together if they would get fur on it or chew my stuff up


I mentioned that she might want to think about finding new homes for at least two of them and she got really offended. She said something about her commitment to taking care of them that didn't sit well with me. I feel as the human my needs should be of a higher priority than her pets if she really loved me like she says.


Am I setting myself up for always being second best to her dogs?"
relationship_advice,What should I(18m) do about a girl(20f) I met today?,"I went to the bank to sort out my account and was assisted by this really nice girl.
I think she was flirting with me from how she laughed and made jokes to how she made absolutely sure if I had any questions before i went. She also gave me her personal business card and put a star next to her email. 
I did later look her up on Instagram (hopefully this doesn’t sound creepy lol) and found her account, which says she’s 20 but the account is private.
Maybe I’m imagining this, perhaps it’s all in my head and its just how she always is. But I’d like some advice on 2 things.
Firstly, how do I know if she was flirting with me? If I’m not sure do I just take my shot anyway?
Secondly, if I was to contact her what would be the best way to do it? Go back to the bank? Email her? Or follow her on Instagram? The last option may seem kinda creepy.
If you could give me any advice on this I’d be very grateful."
relationship_advice,I [23M] have cheated/felt compelled to cheat in every relationship I have ever been in. I am asking how to begin getting proper help.,"TL;DR: Title. I value any and all opinions on how to approach relationships moving forward because apparently I am not able to successfully do this myself

Hi everyone,

I am not a good person. I can type out the litany of issues wrong with me but I don't think that would be conducive for this post. I am asking how to even get help with the situation of me incessantly growing distant and cheating or losing interest in a relationship.  I've talked to counseling services, I've been attempted to be ""fixed"" while in a relationship, I've been single for a while to ""reflect and love myself"", but nothing works. It could just be user error, but I honestly feel like I cannot be in a healthy relationship.

I feel inclined to cheat because it is a mix of getting bored with the person I am with, and the rush of meeting someone new. I love the feeling of sexual desire. I make sure I am constantly looking good because that attraction is a feeling that is indescribable with words. Where most people are able to recognize and stop themselves in scenarios like these, the boundary for me is just not there.

I am asking for your help, or if anyone has similar experiences. 

Thank you."

relationship_advice,Was it unforgivable? Was it really a big deal?,"Is breaking up because of him going away for work and not wanting to do long distance (despite me asking him to at least give it a try) a big deal? 
It hit me that I might be making a bigger fuss out of it than needed. I respected his decision and let him go but didn't accept his offer (made a month after splitting up) of trying to get together after he's back for work in our city (in like 3 months) and now I'm thinking I shouldn't recklessly shut him off since I love him and deep inside want him back? Maybe it wasn't that much of a deal and I should've tried to forgive him?"
relationship_advice,What Should I do about a friend that is destroying a relationship inside out but has like no clue of it ?," 

Basically, it starts like this, his sister studies abroad and his close family (parents and him) visited her for christmas instead of the other way around, while on this trip, his parents went back home earlier, so he stood there with just his sister and her friends for a few days (new year and some days after), and, while on his sis's apartment, he met this girl around his age, and they built a weird chemistry (His words not mine, but he didn't know she was dating) and they cuddled for a while then started kissing and as you might expect things developed but it didn't last long because she felt wrong about it.

Up until here it's as bad as it seems, it's cheating and that is unforgivable, but IMO, what happens after makes it worse. So basically, after he came back to where he lives, he and the girl kept in touch, and what started in small flirty talk turned into a full out lover's conversation (remind you the girl was dating), and so his close friends (me and some others) started telling him how wrong it was and how he woul'dnt like to be on the spot the other guy is, yada yada yada, to which he just replied ""it's different"", like he is the main character of some romance or anime story, like his wrong actions take no consequence and he's free to keep it going. Some of the friends took it badly, put an Ultimatum on him (""Either stop talking to her/tell her boyfriend or you won't be my friend anymore"") , to which on the first case he threatened \*uicide and attacked directly the friend's relationship, and in the second and third cases he basically repeated the process (coincidentally both those friends are dating too). And after all this went down, I decided I had to take action and tell the girl's boyfriend that this tomfoolery is going on, so am I wrongly interfering for telling him all that happened betweeen his girlfriend and a random dude from far away? (Remind you my then friend had no intention to cut it off and would keep it going until idk, everything fell on top of him, so I'm just trying to make it better for him and the boyfriend of the girl, frick the girl honestly.)"
relationship_advice,I [F22] miss this and that...,"I miss being excited. I miss my energy.

Hi. I just really need to let this out.

I've been single for 3 years now, there are times I want to be in a relationship again, but I change my mind after a minute or so; there's this constant reminder that it's draining, emotionally and mentally. I love tenderly and loyally, I guess I'm just afraid to commit again. I feel like, the more I love, the greater the tendecy to be in pain. 

My first and last relationship lasted for 6 months only, it took me 2 years to move on (on and off). Yup, I know. Stupid. I'm judging myself too. But I belive a person's impact isn't measured on time. The experience taught me a lot, I continued to learn to love myself. I focused more on my goals and dreams. My perspective widen etc. I trusted the whole process. But it's also the reason why my walls are thicker and higher. Sure, I can work on letting a person in my life again. But how can I make sure I won't be left building another set of walls again? That they won't ghost me? Or make it look all true, fuel it with sweet words etc. just to know I'm an insignificant love? I guess I just want to be sure we'll put the same effort and loyalty in the relationship, that we're on the same page. The word is ASSURANCE. 

I'm willing to put an effort in meeting someone, but my social life has been dead since I graduated college. My mind is always in the state of: I need to work more, build myself, achieve this and that, get more jobs than I should have, etc. I like being productive, but I sometimes feel I'm missing the fun of life. 

I miss cuddles, having someone to talk to about anything, being excited, being loved and able to give it back without hesitation. I've tried dating apps and man, it's fucking tiring. The whole process of hi hellos, getting to know each other, trying to find that ""connection"", ghosting etc. It's mentally exhausting. 

If you've made it this far, thank you. Just really need to let it out, been stressed these past weeks due to work and this whole frustration.

This post may have or have not made me sound cynical, but I/I'm also:
- VERY INDEPENDENT
- naturally caring and thoughtful (like a mom)
- funny and witty (tHIS IS ACCORDING TO MY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO)
- like to make fun of myself as a copping mechanism when I'm suffering
- VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE :(( can cheer you up in any way possible, as long as you're not being stupid/trying to hurt others/etc.
- sensitive to others' feelings. I always symphatise with others more than I do with myself looool

Probably just a rant, but can also use your helping words. Or send me a message if you're interested in talking, I guess??? We'll see. 

That's just it. To you reading this, I really hope you're well :)x"

relationship_advice,Abandoned after setting Boundaries,"I have a group of really good friends, we are in a group chat. One made some insensitive comments. In the group chat I asked that they refrain from making the inappropriate comments. Even used #boundaries in my request. 

The person that my comment was meant for understood my position. My other friend who happened to be in the group got offended because I used the word y’all. I was addressing the group about my boundaries, letting one friend know he crossed the line, the other that I’m setting a boundary in our friendship. 

The friend who was offended, has abandoned the friendship. I refuse to get angry at him for it and have begun to process the loss. 

Is this normal? I thought our bond was so strong we would be back to normal. I even told him he has never crossed the boundary nor do I expect him to. 

I will take responsibility for my actions and I won’t change my values. Figured I would give him some space. 

Should I walk away as well? Or give him space to think about it?"
relationship_advice,Girl interested or wasting time?,"Girl wasting my time or?



Girl used to reply fast now only replies at night?

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn’t slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don’t understand if she’s losing interest shouldn’t she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I’m deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I’m going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I’m just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?
I find it weird that she canceled (sign of lost interest(?)) but she continued to chat with me constantly afterwards?"
relationship_advice,"Should we let a worker keep a phone he ""stole""?","One of our long time employees, Albert, was entrusted to help move our things from the city capital to the province. Its an all expense paid trip. He went with my dad. My sister is also a witness to what transpired.

My mom hid some phones around the house (they were moving out of), this are ""our just incase something happens"" emergency phones. 

They aren't all that expensive but aren't the cheap ones either. 

Albert found one of the phones and without any ""hey can I have this?"" He put his sim inside and started using it. He wasn't shy about it either. He took selfies, he was using it to call his friends. 

My sister told my dad about this and he said, Albert did not ask permission from him nor would Dad give any because it wasn't his property to give away. 

Anyway, my mom found out and she felt betrayed. Instead of turning it in when Albert was called out, he kept it and continued using it. 

My sister and I are at the same page that its a small amount but the thought that our workers could get our stuff without permission and use them might set a precedent to him and his colleagues, that it is okay for them to take our things without any permission and act as if they own them already. 

Should we just let Albert keep the phone? Are we donkeys for not wanting to give it? 

P.s Mom gave Albert a phone 6 months ago, its not the flat screen newish types but the ones with keypad. For purposes of calling and texting only. My sister and I also feel guilty for, taking back the phone however feel strongly about this becoming a norm."

They dated 2 years and he got lazy and she left then he chased her a year and she lied about having a bf. They still text and talk so that’s confusing. Now that I’m with him I realize he’s not what I want. I waited so long to be with him and went over his house after 8-9pm for months he didn’t start taking me out till I said things about it. He said he just wanted to hang late cause he thought I was busy and he never gave it thought. We have been going out earlier at 5pm after I talked about it several times. I promised I wouldn’t leave and would take care of his heart... but now I’m seeing his true colors. I’m 22 and he’s 27. Anyone else been in a situation like this? I thought I’d feel different as his gf but I feel the same nonetheless..
relationship_advice,I (M22) was trying to make amends with my ex (F19) until she had an encounter with her previous ex who I despise,"Me and my ex broke up a couple months ago. I was going through a lot at the time and everything became really overwhelming and it felt like it was unfair for my then gf to have to be apart of this so I ended it. I know I hurt her bad but she was very understanding about it all and we remained friends.

As time went by I started to feel like I had made a mistake. My ex was such a lovely person and we were so alike and I could truly be myself with her. I met with her a few weeks ago and we had a great time and I opened up to her and asked for another chance if I could prove I would work on myself and my own personal issues. She turned me down and said she wanted to be alone for now at least 

This was until last night when she confessed that she turned me down because she started speaking to her previous ex again and she gave him head and has felt like shit since. 

Now the issue isn't necessarily with the sexual act but it's the fact it was with her ex who treated her like absolute shit. He was so emotionally manipulative when they were in a relationship and said some really vulgar things towards her and guess what? He did the exact same thing again after this encounter 

What I can't wrap my head around is why she would do something intimate with someone like this after knowing what he's like. I helped her see how toxic he was when we'd talk about previous relationships in the past and it just feels like everything I said and warned her about in the past has been thrown back in my face 

I was really starting to fall for her again and things were getting exciting but now after knowing this I don't know what I feel anymore. What should I do?"

I honestly don't know how or when I got social anxiety but I really hate it since I  want to be that very social person that's always talking to everyone but my anxiety won't let me and I end up overthinking things, feeling ""stuck"" and not knowing what to say. Let me give you guys an example on something that happened today! So I went to my essay class and i sat next to this cute girl and I instantly caught her looking at me and once she realized I caught her she smiled and I obviously smiled back but I was terrified. Soon after that I got very anxious.. didn't know where to look, what to say and even how to sit on my desk (Not necessarily because of the girl) . I'm really good at hiding those feelings so I honestly doubt that anyone noticed it. Anywayssssss back to the girl, we spoke a little bit but nothing really of importance just things that had to do with our class work. I start overthinking shit since I never know what to do or what to do next when talking to a girl I find attractive and this has cost me multiple beautiful women that were into me :( Please help me on fixing my social anxiety or even tell me any tips you guys know!!! I really want this to end and finally be a sociable person and have decent conversations with people!!!"
relationship_advice,i got rejected by my crush,"Listen, i can sit there and cry inside myself in class (always right next to her) and eventually commit suicide.

Or i can choose to become a new person. i HAVE to be more social with her. Even while she is with friends.

relationship_advice,Please need help about this,Hey guys So basically I been struggling lately. My ex when I first saw her I was really into her and she was a big big crush. And now after close to two years of ending I can’t seem to find a different person whose that big of an attraction or crush. I know looks isn’t important and trust me idrc about looks but it really bothers me and makes me think will I ever find someone like my ex again
relationship_advice,Uhhhhhh idrk,"So I liked this guy for about a year, he was one of my best friends, and I asked him out a couple months ago and we started dating but the entire thing gave me too much anxiety. We only hung out alone 3 times and were both too awkward to even hold hands and stuff. I was the only one organizing dates and it seemed kinda one sided. I already have severe anxiety and this new relationship wasn’t helping so I broke up with him and we are still really good friends. I still really like him and he likes me still and he was super supportive of me taking some time to myself and I’m thinking of asking him to prom in April but idk. I’m really really scared I’ll get a bunch of anxiety and break up with him and our friendship will be ruined or that it’ll be a bad experience for me again. I think if I just talk to him about being more open with me with his feelings and putting a little more effort in I’ll be fine but he’s really awkward and not good at showing his emotions or being affectionate so idk. Please help. We are both 16"
relationship_advice,Advice again between me (m34) and girlfriend with addiction/impulse problems (33f),"SO earlier, I posted this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/eijs1k/advice\_on\_drinkinguntrustworthy\_situations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eijs1k/advice_on_drinkinguntrustworthy_situations/) 

&amp;#x200B;

And you guys had some advice, I thank you for that. I decided to stick it out a little longer with the GF and something else happened. One night, after she had been drinking, she got into my blood pressure medication and took a lot of it. Not enough to actually hurt her, but she wanted to go to a mental hospital, told me to take her to the hospital and tell them ""1013"", so I did. Her blood pressure was a little low that night, but she was never in any real danger. She seemingly just wanted to go to the mental hospital for a little while. This is at least the 3rd time she has been 1013'ed with her first being in here 20's. 

Fast forward to her getting out and me picking her up, I asked her what she was going to do going forward. She said she didn't plan on staying sober, she hated being sober. Drugs and alcohol was what she needed to cope with things in life. A day or two after this she wanted to leave her kid with me and ""go hangout"" with her ex heroin addicted girlfriend that just got out of jail. Obviously, to get drugs. I shot that down and she gave me the silent pouty treatment for a while. That weekend, obviously she found something to get high off of, she was not acting like herself. 

Relationship has changed too, she rarely wants to talk to me or have sex, and most often she just sits on her phone, not speaking much.

Yesterday, she expressed interest in getting something to drink. I had I'd prefer she didn't do that, because when she drinks, it turns into a shit show, she picks a fight, and reaches out to other guys, sending pics and expressing interest in them (aka cheats in my opinion).

Seems like I've got a shit show on my hands. Her kid is living with, we've been together for almost a year. This stuff ain't gonna change and just keeps getting harder. 

Maybe she is pushing me to try and end the realtionship, so I'm the bad guy? What is a good course of action, once again, I've let this go too far and been too much of a nice guy....."
relationship_advice,Ex-boyfriend sent my nudes out to his friend group and others. Fiancé (29M) knew and didn’t tell me (25F) until much later.,"I don’t know where to really start, so I’m sorry if this is a mess.

For a little background info, I dated my ex for 6 months before he cheated on me and I left. It wasn’t messy - I quietly left the relationship with a single phone call. I wasn’t bitter and did nothing to “get back at him.” I later started a relationship with my now fiancé. X was/is still dating the girl he cheated on me with. X and fiancé used to be apart of the same friend group, but F had grew out of those friendships for the most part before X and I started dating.

It’s also probably important to mention that everyone involved in this, including me, works a certain public service job where you know everyone. Anyway.

Last night I was having a discussion with my fiancé about whether or not I should stay at my job when I start school. He pushed for me to quit and find a different job because I’d be moved to a different area. The same area X and that friend group work. F said it would cause too many issues for me to work there. 

That’s when it came out that sometime after I started dating F, X had sent my nudes out to his friends and some of his friends sent them out to others. It then got back to F since he used to hang out with them.  I was in the dark and had no idea.  F then said that he was telling me about it now because if I wanted to stay at my job, then I needed to get used to that and people calling me a slut. He said I had to toughen up.

Now I don’t know what to do or how to feel especially towards my fiancé. I’m hurt and angry that he didn’t tell me and I had to see these people and be nice to them while being oblivious to the fact that they saw and may have been the ones to send my nudes out. I’m just so pissed off. F had even planned a mini vacation next month with a few people from that group that were involved. He was going to let me spend time with them after something like that...

F said he didn’t tell me before because it wouldn’t have changed anything. He said there was nothing I could do, so what was the point? I don’t necessarily agree with that logic. 

I don’t really know what advice I’m looking for.  I don’t know what could help but I need something. Where do I go from here with my fiancé? He says it sucks but I should just move on because it happened so long ago.  How do I even begin to maneuver through this? I feel so bad and I can’t stop crying. I’m humiliated and scared to go back to work now that I know what happened.

Thank for you taking the time to read this."
relationship_advice,I had a Miscarriage and my husband couldn't care less...trigger warning,"I (27f) and my husband have been together for 3 years, we were told years ago that I wouldn't be able to have babies because my ovaries were covered in cysts. Which of course was heart breaking but we always have like the idea of adoption. 

Fast foreword to 2019 when in May we discovered we were 6 months preggers with my son. We were OVER THE MOON scared as hell because we had no idea. And in August we had the most beautiful baby boy ever. He's ~6 months old now and we haven't really been using any birth control. 

Tuesday morning at about 5 am I woke up to some Horrible cramping and blood, so we went to the urgent care clinic. After 2 hours they finally told me my body was having a MC and that I should go home and get some rest and expect the worst. 

I cried the whole way home. The entire day I felt horribly wrong and so fucking sad. Queue yesterday. I'm stuck at home with my baby boy #teething babies are so grumpy. So dealing with all the emotions and the pain that came with the MC in full action it's safe to say I really just needed extra cuddles. 

Hubby gets home later than usual. Fine. He comes thru the door and notices that my face is super puffy and red from crying all day and shakes his head and sighs. I asked what was wrong and he blew up saying it was better this way and that I was being overdramatic because ""it's not even a baby anyways."" That broke my heart.

Then he immediately gets all buddy puffy that the house is a mess and it's not his job to clean it up after he's been at work all day. I just lost it and started crying harder saying that I just needed a few days to grieve the loss of our child and that is clean it up when I felt better. He didn't like that so he angrily cleaned up the kitchen and did the dishes (legit like half a dishwasher load) and was throwing a huge hissy fit. 

Now he won't talk to me. He told our son that he was not ""good enough for mama"" 

I'm at a loss, I'm heartbroken and so ANGRY.  I'm very much considering moving out with out a word and going back home to my home state and washing my hands of him for good. But I love my mother and father in law and they would be sad of they couldn't see their grandchild. 

Any advice would be so welcome.  Sorry about the long post. Thank you for reading. Have a blessed day, Reddit."
relationship_advice,Insensitive BF or Sensitive GF?,"I was talking to my bf yesterday morning and he said something that triggered me. I don't know if I am overreacting or my bf was just insensitive. 

My bf is an avid gym goer and I am not. I'm in no means fat, I just don't go to the gym as often as he does. Anywho, I tell my boyfriend, ""I want a bigger butt but I know I don't need one because you make me feel secure."" He responds, ""I like your butt the way it is. You know I'm not an ass guy. But if you want a bigger butt I wouldn't complain! Just remember...squat squat squat!"" 

For some reason this triggered me because I felt he's telling me he's not happy with how my body is and him telling me to do squats is like telling me to drink water when thirty. It's obvious solution which doesn't have to be said. Is he being insensitive or am I just being that crazy sensitive girlfriend?"
relationship_advice,Gf (20) and I (21) look like we might break up after I graduate college,"I am a college senior and my girlfriend is a junior. I live in the town We go to college, and my GF lives about 4 hours away from our college town.

Next year I am going to medical school, an hour away from our college and 5 hours away from her home. 

I also got accepted to another medical school that is closer to her town, but it is not nearly as good as a school as the one an hour away from me and it is wayyy more expensive too.

We talked and she told me how she sees herself going to grad school and living in her home town after college. She has done long distance before and said how awful it was for her. We kinda agreed that we don’t really have an “end goal” so things might be pretty tough. She told me I should pick the medical school that is going to be the best for me and be 100% selfish in my decision.

So we kinda just said we’ll take things as they go and try our best and see what happens. But if the distance is becoming a problem and things aren’t working out, that’s just life and that if we broke up it wouldn’t be anything personal and no hard feelings towards eachother We totally were seeing each others perspectives and me and her both understand. 

I don’t really know why I’m writing this tbh, just sad and scared about it all :("
relationship_advice,Me (20m) got drunk at a party and would love to talk it out,"I got drunk at a party, chatted for a while and made out with a girl that I kinda like. Problem is that I got a bit too drunk, have no memory about the later parts of the night and what drunken me have said/ done. Also forgot to ask her number and if she wants me to talk to her later. 

We go to the same college but we don't hang out in same groups.

I could get her number from bigger group chat but that sounds a bit creepy (?). Going to talk to her in school is super awkward as few days have passed since party and going to talk to her out of blue when she is with her friends doing school stuff. 

Should I:

A) leave it here and try to not think about it. 

B) text asking if I did something stupid that night and if all is fine ask her out. (also what do I say? ""Btw I don't remember anything about that night so did I do anything really stupid and if I did im sorry(?)) 

C) wait a weekend + maybe a few days to reach her and talk about it live. Sounds best in theory but so many days would have passed and  I dont know if her friends know about it and would not want to embarrass her. Also sounds real awkward. 


(I rarely drink so much and feel really embarrassed/ if I said or did anything not cool)"
relationship_advice,boyfriend seems overly comfortable with “small” lies,"looking for some perspective here. on mobile so apologies for the formatting. 

my boyfriend and i got into an argument recently over something seemingly unrelated that circled around to how frequently he lies to me, but doesn’t think i know he’s lying at the time. it’s always small things, like “yes, i wear my seatbelt when you’re not in the car” (he doesn’t) or “no, i didn’t eat the last of ___” (there’s only two people in the house and it sure wasn’t me). it’s constant. ALL the time. in fact, he’s so comfortable lying to me that he frequently, and very confidently, reassures me “i would never lie to you.” which is, in and of itself, a lie. there are always subtle changes that anyone else might miss when he’s lying, but as someone who has been around him for many, many years, i can see it. as far as i know, none of these lies have ever been large or terribly consequential, but they exist enough that it worries me. if he’s so comfortable lying to me about something small, is he lying to me about something big? if he’s not now, could he in the future? i’m concerned that he doesn’t take my feelings into consideration at all. when i brought this up, when i told him i knew he was constantly telling me lies, he shut down (like he always does in arguments or difficult conversations). he doesn’t communicate at all when he needs to and i don’t know what to do."
relationship_advice,I feel like my friends like my sister more than me and I don't know how to act,"My sister is a (very immature) 28 year old who had 2 unsuccessful marriages. After the last one, she moved into our family home with her twin kids (M and F, both are 4). 

I can't freaking stand her. I feel like I have a panic attack whenever she enters the room and I prefer when she is not around me.

A few months back, for some reason, she started hanging out with my friends and me (there are 3 of my friends, all female and all ages 17-18).
It was fine in the beginning. Maybe she will stay for a coffee with us after picking me up from school. Now it's got to a higher level.

She once stated that she would never hang out with them on her own because then she would feel like a grandma. Also, she saw that my friends were kiiind of using her for her car. But, she still hung out with them when I was travelling out of the country.

From what my friends told me, they begged her to go out with them, but still, she could have declined?

She attended my friend's birthday party without me (I wasn't in the country that day) and she also went partying with us a few days later when I got back home.

I feel like they all might like her more than they like me. I guess I kind of understand it since my sister is more interested in trivial topics and gossip more than I am. I rarely use instagram and I see that they send memes to eachother all the time. They even have a group chat without me.

Okay, I get it. I'm not as silly as her, but that's not exactly a good thing because she is a 28 year old. Hanging out with teenagers. And acting like a teenager. 

Am I the only one who thinks this is problematic? Am I the only one crazy here?

Maybe I have a different definition of friendship than they do, but I REALLY don't care about what happens in the virtual world.

What do you guys make of this? Am I wrong here? How should I act in this situation and what should I do about it?"
relationship_advice,Long distance? Or already gone?,"My boyfriend and i have been together for a little over 3 months - and he just moved back to the states after being stationed abroad, i am still abroad. When we started dating we talked all the time, but recently it is hard to start any conversations at all, and when he does respond, it's usually pretty short and doesn't really help the conversation flow or evolve. I offered to travel to see him before he left and he never responded to the question, instead he brought uo an entirely different topic 2 hours after i originally asked. I'm at a loss of what to do, i want this so badly but it just doesn't seem like he does - i'm just at a loss and so confused -- i would be extremely grateful for any advice or anything at all"
relationship_advice,My (20M) GF (19F) broke up with me because she's depressed. Please help!,"Hi guys,

Foreword: 

- We met on an online dating app. We both started using it for the first time, met up, and then started dating. We've been dating for about three months.

- She was cheated on twice by her ex. She left him after a 2 year relationship. They broke up about half a year ago.

Just last night my girlfriend of about three months texted me that she wanted to talk. I drove out to her apartment, and she told me that she wanted to break up. She said that she still has feelings for me, but that whenever she isn't with me she feels very ""sad"", and that she feels like she needs to improve herself for me. Previously, I have discussed that she feels very distant from me when we are not together. We have had discussions about this before, but I did not know that she was depressed/very sad. When we are together, we are very happy and it feels like things work well for the both of us. I tried to convince her that I'm ok with the way things have been (it's been getting better in my eyes), and she was almost convinced, but then made an adamant decision to break up. Currently, I'm devastated, and feel like total shit. I have no idea what to do. What do I do? Any input is greatly appreciated."
relationship_advice,I Can't Get It Out of My Head That I Cheated On My Girlfriend,"Last night, we went to a local gay bar (as we do on a Thursday night). Me (23) and my girlfriend (20) had two cocktails before we went. She had two more drinks on the night. I started on another, and then when ordering more I realised all my friends had dispersed within and outside the bar. I found myself in a group of gay men; one of which was ***very*** drunk. I found myself starting with them, waiting to be served. Having social anxiety, I just accepted it, as i was buying a round for my friends. I couldn't really understand what the very drunk one was saying, but he was a violent hugger; something I usually don't like, but having had 3 spirit based drinks at this point, I allowed. He was going on about how great I am and all that jazz, and say he'd get me a jagerbomb. This would be drink number 4. As I was being served, and placing drinks on a table of people I knew my friends knew, he asked for a kiss. It was like how I imagine a family kiss would be, like uncle you haven't seen in a long time at a family gathering....but it's eating me up instead. He's gay, I'm gay, but I just feel sick to my stomach and anxious about the whole situation. Later, a friend pulls me aside saying I need to have a talk with my girlfriend, who asked what had happened with the group of drunk gays. She asked if I kissed him back...and I said I didn't...but i did in a sense. It was a peck but that's no excuse. I can't express how awful I feel about this, and I need some advice on what to do please."
relationship_advice,my partner (18M) says its ok to rape someone their entire lives as long as theyre AI. i dont know how to feel.,"So we were dicussing the eden club scene in Detroit become human. I mentioned how sad it was that their sole purpose in life (at least in the eyes of humans) is to be raped 24/7. My partner brought up that theyre programmed for it and it doesnt matter. that raping them is ok as long as they are ai and that the programmers would be stupid for giving the androids pain recepters. He never said anything sbout how its wrong for a human to hurt an adroid in the first place. 

as a rape survivor myself, im physically repulsed by this new... Information. He knows i even went through this, but everytime it comes up he acts jaded and brings up the few people who truly lie about the accusation, only because he was accused when he was younger by his step mom. 

i dont even want to see him. sitting near him makes me feel unsafe. I don't want to do anything sexual for a long time, i know if i were to be an android hed have no problem raping me, abusing me, and treating me as an object. He repulses me now. i dont trust him, and i dont feel safe.

I dont know what to do. Some may say im over reacting, but it doesnt matter. his reaction to me bringing up how what he said was fucked up was ""Well, you hate (dont like) british people so you cant say anything"" AS IF IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CONVERSATION. 

reddit, what would you do?"
relationship_advice,I think my(22m) girlfriend(21f) is falling in love with a coworker of hers.,"We are currently in ldr and I agree I haven't given her as much as attention and time she deserves. I had a bit of stressful period and I took it out on her and she took it in stride and stood by me. I think I have fallen more in love with her because she is so understanding.

It's going to be a year since we started dating. She started working at a new place and told me one guy was trying to make plans with her / hang out. I read their texts and I knew he was totally hitting on her and my girlfriend had no clue. I ask her to stop talking to the guy and she did. I never thought there might be a time where she'd have guys crushing on her. She isn't that hot but she is pretty cute. 

When I thought everything was settled she tells me she made a new friend who was super ""funny"" and ""interesting"". I told her how valuable it is to have nice colleagues and how I had a female colleague whom I always went with to coffee breaks. (this was a trigger point of our relationship and she usually used to get jealous). She doesn't even register it and has this weird happy smile. I thought the guy must be ugly. But turns out he is attractive and looking at their texts he is totally hitting on her. 

I wanted to date an average looking girl because I didn't want to care about guys hitting on her. But it feels like my girlfriend is guy-magnet. 

Tl:Dr - girlfriend in love with coworker."
relationship_advice,Fear,"
So Recently I went through the motions of my ex breaking up with me

The love in the relationship wasn’t real for him and he tried to force something out of something that was never there

He admitted it wasn’t working but was always indecisive 

I always felt after there were periods of closeness and distance. Always had this feeling but I kept pushing it away

Him not visiting me in the hospital, making excuses to ask me to be his girlfriend after 6 months. Throwinf concert tickets that I spent a fortune on in the bin because it was cold outside and he’d rather stay in despite telling him we’d be going out and he was okay with it before. Running around for him to get something like he told me, only for him to tell me he didn’t want it. Telling me true love is when your gf forget her keys and he has to go running to go and get it for her from a mile away. I asked if he’d do anything like that for me and he said no. He said he’d never protect me in a street fight because he could get stabbed.   Making excuses for withdrawing kisses (my lips are cold etc) making excuses for why he didn’t want to meet my parents yet, mentioning his ex, calling his ex his girlfriend or his wife by accident. So many things. 

Eventually he told me he didn’t want to hear that I felt used in the relationship over the last 3 weeks after the breakup so came clean. “I don’t want you to say you were being used. That’s why I didn’t have sex with you”

I have an awful relationship with my mother. A toxic one infact. My grandmother told me she hates me and also told me that my father doesn’t like me (my mother’s mother) and he treats my siblings better. My father loves me but I always thought what if he doesn’t and she confirmed my thoughts 

I also have bulimia and my ex used to tell me to stop training my quads (I had a name for being quadzilla because I had big quads because I did a fair bit of bodybuilding. And I liked them”

Then he went and liked pictures of girls with big steroid quads , I asked him why and he said that he likes to draw and they looked nice to draw

Many times in the relationship i normalised things that were wrong. Now I don’t know what is right and what is not

I’m scared to meet people because of this. I’m scared (also because precious relationships were the same) that no one will love me enough. I also have vaginismus and it’s been a dealbreaker. For everyone except him

Now I have 2 things to worry about. How do I get over my fear. He’s behind breaking my confidence down little by little. Every day. I started off happy. Doing things independently. I can barely do things by myself now"
relationship_advice,I’m starting to think that my parents are narcs and have messed up my childhood.,"

This is gonna be a long story, sorry about that.

Recently I’ve started “realising” that my childhood was pretty abusive and maybe because of that I’m having trouble making friends and I’m being shy and introverted to the point of thinking that i might be autistic(i know i sound crazy, just hear me out)

The earliest bad example of parenting i can think of is when i was around 6-7yrs old. I remember playing near an area under construction and was being carefree. I climbed on top of some rubble and it started collapsing which was very dangerous. The immediate next thing i know is that I’m being scolded by my father and then he started beating me WITH A FUCKING SHOE. 

The second incidence is from my mother when she was scolding me about my studies when I was 9. I don’t know why, i was so frustrated i started banging my head agianst the wall while crying saying to her “you are making me go mad”. In response she brought a FUCKING KNIFE from the kitchen in a threatening way. Now, i believe she would never in a million years use a knife against me, however, i do think this is bit of an over-the-top action to take.

My childhood is filled with a lot of such experiences where i was beaten my shoes, slippers, wooden sticks(some really thick ones too). The beatin would usually start with a reason of not doing my “homework”. Now, this homework was not from school but rather an extra gave by my father. And like every cliche reason, i was not studying because of the damn TV and computer and also because i was out playing. 

I still vividly remember that many times i got asked to verify that I’ve completed my work when i was trying to strike a conversation with my father about the things that i liked (phones and computers), i was really into technology and wanted to be an engineer or something in that line of work. This used to piss him off and was usually followed by me being thrashed. This resulted in me being reclusive at home and not really talking to a lot of people outside as well.

The second really common behavior was when my father drank. He wasn’t ‘drunk’ but enough inebriated to make him talk a lot, which involved me and my studies and thus, me being thrashed again. 

Growing up, my parents disconnected our TV and internet, so till the 7th grade I didn’t even have any idea what any of my school friends were talking about and felt like and outcast over there too.

Believe me, i wish i was lying. What i now feel is that, all the oppression made me sulk in a corner and not make a lot of social connections in fear of my parents finding out.

Fast forward to selecting a profession-
My father FOR A WHOLE YEAR ranted about how being an engineer is so lame, and that there are a lot of them, with really low wages. Since i was really immature at the time, i ended up following his advice, and selected to try for medical school (i was 15 at that time)

When i was 17 i got into a medical college with a really good scholarship which made it really easy for my parents to pay for my tuition. This was also the time i met a really sweet girl and we ended up falling in love. She was also trying to get into a medical school but was failing to do so.

During my first year of med school i encouraged her and only talked about our happy future. But alas, she couldn’t make it that year. The next year, i decided to help her more, and to put our relationship at a hold to make her fully concenterate on her studies. Now here comes the really worst part that I’ll regret for as long as I’m alive.

I was really furious and aggressive with her. Scolding her that she was wasting time. Anytime we talked, it was about her studies and me either making happy cutesy remarks about how great she is doing or scolding her about why she is wasting her time and should try harder. I let this go on FOR A YEAR. The day of her exam, after giving her exam she didn’t respond to any of my texts and i was furious that I’m trying so hard for her sake and she is acting like this. That’s when she broke up with me.

In retrospect, i think i was doing what i thought was the way to enter a med school, with hardships and endurance. I was still admiring my parents, thinking that what they did was for my benefit, and that I wouldn’t have succeeded if they didn’t intervene.

After a whole year being numb from breakup and another year working on myself, I’m starting to realise how wrong i was about everything.

I’m at a point on my life where i was very few friends, I don’t really appreciate a lot of small things. The turning point was when my friend said to me, “he doesn’t do much of formalities so I don’t know what to do for him”. To me it sounded like, “he doesn’t get excited all that much by anything that i do for him”. 

I feel like all my experiences have made me fear being happy. Right now, I don’t fantasise about being successful or being well built. I just need a happy loving family and a place that I’ll love to call home. I’m already thinking how I’ll raise my kids and ways to keep my parents away from them.

I felt like a different person when i was in that relationship. Right now I’m in my final year of med school and have way too much to study so I don’t even have time to get a girl. I’ve turned down advances just because i think i might not be able to give enough time right now.

I just want to know, I’m i going nuts and really ungreateful? Or am i right?"
relationship_advice,My boyfriend says tthe wrong things,"This is my first post on this sub so please be gentle with me.

Background info: My boyfriend (M23) and I (F19) have been together for 2.5 years now. We share the same interests, have the same humor etc. He studies in a city about a 2 hour drive from where I live and visits me on weekends, which I really appreciate, concidering the long drive. During holidays he basically lives with me. We're not that type of couple that's all about the pet names and sweet talk, we rather communicate and tease each other like friends which is more than okay for me. We're really comfortable around each other and I can really be myself around him. 

My problem: I know I alone am responsible for my self confidence and it shouldn't be reliant on compliments of other people but the thing that really bothers me with him is that he never compliments me. He has no problem to say how hot this actress or that model is, which I understand because it's basically their job to be pretty, but he never says anything remotley similar to me.   
And the thing that makes it worse is the fact that he goes to far with teasing me.   
For example today: I've been sick for the past two days and feeling like shit. I just had a nap and woke up when he told me: ""Haha, look at your zits."" and starts counting them. I'm okay with the teasing but imo he could've been so considerate and not do it when I'm in such a shitty condition.   
The other time (about 6 months ago but still bothers me): I was putting lotion on my body whilst he was still in the bathtub watching me when he blatantly says: ""You'd only need to lose weight around your legs."" And he knows my legs are one of my weak spots.   


I've tried to talke to him about it and he kinda knows there's something wrong with him or his behavior but it doesn't seem like he's willing to change anything.   
What else can I do?

TLDR: my boyfriend never compliments me and only says mean things to me. I tried to talk to him but it didn't help."

relationship_advice,How do you know when you should compromise in a relationship and when to draw the line?," I had to make a throwaway account because I'm a little worried that my bf (almost ex) who is following me on my real one will read this. Idk whether I really want advice or just some support/validation but here we go
 I (18F) have been in a relationship with a guy (22M) for about 3 years. It has been pretty stressful and I feel like I'm in a really bad state of mind from it all. I feel like all my birthdays and Christmas vacations have been me just worrying about this guy. I have been talking to my bf about this for a month now and he refuses to get some perspective on it.
  We met at a college campus and he approached me. We hit it off and all my friends were teasing me about dating a guy since I was in a girl's school and never had a bf. He was very sweet but also very different from me. I decided to make it work. He didn't begin talking about sex right away but I initiated talking about it. In the beginning he said he didn't want to take advantage of me but I kissed him and from that day onwards he got extremely sexual. I got a little anxious and broke it off with him. 
  We patched up again and he was pretty normal until he got way too possessive. He was raised religious so me showing skin bothered him but he would be okay with me wearing fashionable clothing as long as I covered up. I found that unreasonable and we got into a fight and I told him he should follow the same rules which pissed him off and he goes ""I didn't make them"". I decided to compromise and went ahead with the relationship. After that he broke it off because he said he needed space but he kept saying I love you to me on a daily basis. He consistently asked me for sex (I had made it clear that I was waiting to do it). That is NOT a compromise I was willing to make so he had to.
  We dated after that again and he told me clearly that if we were going to get serious and married one day, I would have to live with his parents and have strict rules about my clothes and language. I was angry at the suggestion and broke it off again. He sends me a few angry text messages saying I'm the kind of abusive girl who separates her guy from his parents and we fought again but  he came back and told me it was time for me to show character and compromise as he had. I'm not sure if he's just an asshole or I'm just being unreasonable to him. Besides the who thing with being a hypocrite he seems to be the most caring and genuine person. He is there to talk to me whenever I want and I feel like I'm losing on a good guy here. Any suggestions?"

Am I being trickle truthed?

My gf cheated on me 8 months ago I’ve not been an angel myself and I cheated first however I came clean straight away and told the truth to her. she says she felt uncomfortable about even being at this guys house she was there for 5 mins before they kissed for about a minute and there wasn’t even any touching even over clothes before going to bedroom. he told her he’d meet her in the bedroom during kissing in this guys living room She went to the toilet and got in bed her words were she “just let it happen” she says when she got in bed he had a condom on already and he asked her to touch him so she masturbated him for a minute apparently he never touched her vagina though. then he grabbed her on top and then he kissed her she says she felt bad during The whole encounter and she never enjoyed the sex but if this was the case my thinking is she would of left she said there was no flirting, talking during it or oral and right after she got up and left. She said I’m bigger and better in bed her story has changed a few times and it seems like she’s just making it look like she didn’t want it when she did. After this happened 8 months ago she treated me like a dick for about two weeks blaming everything on me before splitting up with me when we got back together I found out she reluctantly admitted.

Looking for peoples opinions any help would be appreciated, thanks."

relationship_advice,Should I text or not?,"I've had a crush on this doctor at the hospital I work at for about a month. It's really starting to tense me up. We don't talk at work because we're at an awkward stage. Sometimes, I think he likes me, sometimes not. I've tried to talk to him, but I never get the chance. We just stare at distances. One time, he waved at me through a mirror reflection??? Instead of just looking back at me. 

Also, one of the reasons why I'm scared of talking is because he is about 8 years older, he's a doctor while I'm an orderly/student. 

I'm really stressing out. I've known his Facebook for about a month but I think I'm gonna text him today. Im scared it's gonna really awkward. What are your opinions? If yes, what should I use as the starter, I wanna get this crush over with. Whether I'm rejected or not."
relationship_advice,Lying,"Hi I’m 18 and my GF is 17.

We’ve been going out almost a year now and it’s been great however in the past three months we’ve had some issues.

I logged into her messenger which I know isn’t right but I wanted to see what she was like before me. She’s always told me that I was her first for everything sexual. I knew she’d met boys and kissed boys but always believed that was it. However I’ve found out that wasn’t the case, she hasn’t had sex but has done other things. It wouldn’t have bothered me at the time but the fact I’ve believed she hadn’t had any other interaction before me has come as a shock. It’s worried me because she always seems to make these silly lies in our relationship because she fears that I will think badly of her.

We’ve just had a big argument and I don’t know where to go. She wants to make it up to me and I do care for her but these silly lies have frustrated me. To know I’ve also been lied to for a whole year thinking that I was her first for sexual interactions is really upsetting. It wouldn’t have bothered me at the start but now I’ve just found it, it almost feels like she’s done it recently. I am someone who finds it hard to trust but I really do feel comfortable with this girl I’m just worried if she’ll do it again.

Any advice?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend is going to the club without me and it’s making me nervous,"My girlfriend (20 years old) is just wonderful she’s mature, responsible, funny. we’ve been together for 6 months and we’ve went multiple parties at clubs before but this time she’s going with a few of her friends without me, her friends are the opposite they’re very immature (drugs, showing up to work drunk etc..)
She’s not the type to cheat on me and she’s very loyal but add skimpy outfits a few feel good pills some alcohol and influence from her friends and now it gets me nervous. 
I don’t want to be the controlling boyfriend and tell her not to go because I do trust her I just maybe don’t trust the people around her.
How do I approach this situation ? i don’t want to her not go, but how can I maybe voice my concerns without scaring her away or messing things up ?"
relationship_advice,Need some guidance..,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over six years and we have a 4 year old daughter together. We have gone through many rough patches but we worked through them. Over the last few months I’ve been feeling resentful towards him because in all decisions he puts himself first. Maybe he doesn’t realize it, but I have been carrying most of the parental weight and it’s getting to me. Here are some examples; if our daughter is sick, he won’t take a day off work to be with her because he knows I will. He won’t bring her to a doctors appointment, the various speech therapy appointments (he did one time), won’t even take her out just for fun. Just last week I had to get a tooth removed, and that very evening he came home from work and went straight to his room to play on his phone. I went up to ask him if he could help me out and all he said is that he is too tired. I had to cook dinner and bedtime routines all while being in immense pain and feeling dopey from the T3’s I was on.

Another thing that bothers me is his lack of emoting. He doesn’t celebrate anything. Not Christmas, not anniversaries, not birthdays, not anything. He simply doesn’t feel its important to celebrate anything. And personally, I love celebrating! I feel that any positive energy I can inject into my life is important. So year after year, our anniversary comes and goes. The first few years were tough, but I’ve become so used to it I don’t even bring it up anymore. I just go on celebrating myself with my daughter, and leave him out of the plans entirely. Just for kicks every now and then I invite him to join us, but as always he would just rather do his own thing.

He doesn’t show me love through affection or tenderness, he shows me in other ways. He will sometimes do laundry and put it away, or put out the garbage and recycling without being asked to. This, to him, is how he shows me love. But to me, it’s a responsibility that comes with having a family. 

I’ve tried on many occasion to explain how I feel unloved and unappreciated, but his response is usually along the lines of “I’m not forcing you to stay with me, and I’m not going to beg you to stay.” So in an attempt to keep from being hurt, I stopped even talking to him about my feelings regarding him. He just won’t look inward. 

I know it’s hard to put all the details in a reddit post, so I should add this. He is a nice guy and is very goal oriented. I fell in love with him when I was spiralling down depression lane and he helped me pick up the pieces and feel good again. He helped me quit drinking and helped me grow into a mature adult. He’s very smart, good with his hands, and is a hard worker. His goal for us is to work hard and pay our debts, buy a house and start a business. As much as I’d love to share this goal with him, a part of me is worried he will never make his family’s emotional needs a priority. We need a partner and father, not an income.

This morning we go into a big fight over something we’ve talked about before. Every morning I wake up early with him to prepare his lunch and morning coffee. And this morning, he just flicked on the bedroom light to wake me up. He knows I hate that, and here’s the backstory ; growing up, my mom would burst into my room in the morning and flick on the light and proceed to yell at me until I got off the bed. This went on for years. And even now, my heart races and I have a panic attack when someone wakes me up by flicking on the light. I hyperventilate and get nauseous. I’ve talked to him about this and why it’s so important to just nudge me or just talk to me rather than flick on the light. But he still does it. And this morning I became very angry with him because it seems he simply does not care how it affects me. I told him not to do it again, and his response was “ maybe we need our own bedrooms” 

I grew up in a household where my parents couldn’t stand each other and that’s not what I want for my daughter. I need advice on how to move forward from here. I’m torn between “sucking it up” for the sake of our daughter, or leaving him.  Leaving him seems impossible due to financial and work reasons, but it’s been done before and can happen for me too.

relationship_advice,My (20M) Girlfriend (19F) of a year plus Might be losing feelings for me. (ThrowawayRA Account btw),"I met my girlfriend back in September of 2018, her first semester of college. We met on Bumble and decided to go on a date to dinner nearby the day after we matched. We instantly had a connection and for the next three days i would drive to her and we would just enjoy each others company and get to know each other. She lives a state over from me, and i live in the state of her college. I have went home with her multiple times over school breaks, have met her family, close friends etc many times. Now onto the problems.

Throughout our relationship I always felt secure and positive. this is the longest relationship i've ever been in (a year and four months at this point) and i'm her first real relationship. We get into dumb arguments often, especially over the phone when she's away on break. 

I visited her for a few days on New Years, and we had a good time. The from NYE to the day before she got back from winter break we got into some larger arguments. My problem here, is i never ever want to make her upset, and i could never just assume how hurt she was by those arguments. She starts getting pretty cold with me and all i tell her is i want her to be honest with me and tell me whats going on. So she says she needs to talk that night, and when i talk to her on the phone she tells me she thinks she cant do this anymore. That was 4 days ago. 

Every day since we have talked twice in person and twice over the phone about her feelings, the situation, and what she was thinking. She is a fairly emotional and caring person, and is fairly indecisive on the whole thing. 

The first night we talked in person she told me that she actually caught feelings, and actually made out with her best guy friend (Who i have met and hung out with with her many times when i go home with her) the day before she started talking to me about her conflicting feelings about our relationship. She tells me she never wanted to be this person because she knows if i ever caught feelings for someone and did something like that she would break up with me on the spot. I tell her i understand where she is coming from and what she was thinking then. At this time we just had a pretty messy argument that honestly, i cant remember why either of us were upset. and she cant either. it's just dumb petty shit, and i am so far past ever wanting to be in an argument again. but i tell her i understand because she had mentally clocked herself out of the relationship with how upset she has been feeling over time.

The other issue here is that, I never knew how this was affecting her. I didn't know these arguments were bogging her down so much. but anyway. she does understand that i am whole heartedly ready to make the change in that aspect. The real problem, and the reason i'm making this post is because, she is unsure of what she wants. she feels that she has to cut things off with me for a few reasons:

1. She feels she wont feel the same again, after all the emotions and bad feelings (mind you semi ignoring all of the great times and memories and bonding we did have.)
2. She knows if i was in her shoes she wouldn't want to be in a relationship, that she would feel so hurt by her choice to make out with and her not choice to catch feelings for

I am doing everything in my power to make things work. I see a future with her, and a happy one. I see this as an opportunity to be better and to grow together. But all of this has happened so quickly for me, and for her it's been a continuous descent due to the emotional trauma of arguing and getting hurt.

I want things to get better and i want to try but i don't know what else i can really do,

 At the end of each convo each day we end the night by agreeing that we want to work on things and be better. but throughout the next day she would think that we still need to figure things out because she still feels ""weird"". I stayed over her apartment last night and we talked it out again. She decided she wants to really work on things, but is still feeling, in her words ""icky"" about certain things. She still loves and cares about me, but for some reason she cant decide whether a relationship is right when i know its at least worth getting comfortable again. 

I'm picking her up tonight and she's staying over my house so we'll have tonight and the day tomorrow to feel things out more. Any advice on this? I know its a lot so thank you so much fro reading and responding. I'll post an edit if i feel i'm missing any other info. Thanks again :)"
relationship_advice,I (18M) feel I need more from life,"I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now, she has BPD, and has become dependent on me for happiness. She lives a 40 minute drive from me. If I’m not with her she goes through episodes of sadness which can often take a toll on our relationship, and she also makes a big deal or turns my words against me. For example, if I for whatever reason try to cancel meeting with her, she thinks I don’t love her and I don’t want to spend time with her. This is obviously emotionally draining as am starting to feel I don’t have enough time to myself, and to explore my own life. She’s very needy, which is fine, but she makes me feel like the bad guy, talks bad about me to her friends making me seem like a crap boyfriend despite me doing literally everything for her. She only highlights the bad things about our relationship, rather than a better things. This causes her friends to suggest I’m not good enough etc etc. This aggravated me, is that so wrong? I am always the one going to her because my family don’t like her as they feel she pulls my strings, which I admit I am starting to see more and more. I love her to bits, she’s my best friend and the only person I’ve truly connected to. I am extremely patient, but I am at a cross road

A part of me feels I’d be better without her, and happier. However I don’t want to break things off, because if I’m wrong I would have blown my only chance."
relationship_advice,Congnitive Dissonance,"I’m looking for someone to help me get through this if you’ve been there before. Basically my mind tells me that I’m in a bad relationship and it could be toxic and making my life complicated. But I can’t seem to let go of it though I tried few times already to break up. But it’s so painful that we seem to start talking to each other again after few hours or a couple of days. It’s a meet each other every day for a month, live together for 3 weeks, turned into a LDR and we’ve been in this relationship for about 7 months now."
relationship_advice,Choosing between girlfriend and friends.,"Hi, I’m 25 and my girlfriend is 22. We’ve been together for 3 years.

A group of guy friend that I don’t get to see often because we all have conflicting schedules asked me to come to a concert with them.

A day before, my girlfriend also asked me to go to the same concert and I told her I’d think about it because I had to check my schedule. I thought I had something planned that say but turns out that I don’t.

So I asked my guy friends if they were bringing their girlfriends and they all said no, it was just going to be a guys night to reunite since we rarely ever see eachother.

If I tell my girlfriend I’m going to go with them, she’ll probably feel hurt because I know she wants to go.

If I bring her with me, it’ll probably be awkward. To be honest her and my friends don’t really get along too well after a big argument we had on Halloween.

I’m not sure what to do. I see my girlfriend every day and haven’t seen my friends in months but I don’t want to hurt her feelings by going with them and not her.

relationship_advice,My (30M) girlfriend (30F) and I had ecstasy. I confessed the trauma experienced as a soldier. She no longer feels safe with me.,"I love my girlfriend, she's incredibly smart and a loving woman. We've been dating for less than a year but I felt we shared the same values and a future. The one point we did disagree on was recreational drug use which she's used on occasion.

She's from a very privileged family but escaped her lawless home country.  As a girl, she was the victim of a bombing and watched her home country fall into chaos.

Over NYE she suggested I try a small dose of MDMA / ecstasy for the first time.

It's the closest thing I could describe it as is a spiritual experience. I confessed I loved her and felt bliss, except surprisingly retreating during the fireworks at 9pm. She knows I served, but the conversation never went far as both times she would asked if I killed people directly. 

This week we had a large party to celebrate a national holiday (we're not American). She shared an article on MDMA's use in PTSD therapy, and I agreed to have another dosage.

Whilst under the influence I disclosed that as a soldier I had taken the lives of others. My girlfriend and a close female friend of hers were mostly unaffected by the MDMA unlike me. I don't recall what I said, but she said I confessed to killing women and children.

My girlfriend took me aside, let me share my truth and we partied until sunset.

The days following she's asked me, how many women and children I’ve killed.

At the time I didn't recall the specifics of my confession, merely knowing I revealed too much.

We were in the middle of a Netflix comedy and felt her opening line was abrupt. I did try to explain the 'don't know' but inelegantly.

I responded,I don't know - I know bad response and I'll explain.

I don't know because we would only return fire when engaged. Up to 16 soldiers would be returning fire. Most of these engagements were at roughly 300meters / 300 feet. It's impossible to know the enemy shooting at me is a woman, child, or man until after. It's impossible to know if I killed them, or simply returned fired in their direction. I would go into autopilot mode, return fire, reload, clear any rifle jams. Training takes over, it's like when one drives to work and can't recall driving.

Most of the combatants would be older veterans but in the fighting season there were teenagers, we were teenagers too but they younger than even us. Additionally, kids, widows and the mentally handicapped were used as suicide bombers.

It's fucked and I've tried not to think about this in the decade since. After an injury I discharged and 12 weeks later I enrolled in engineering school. I've worked corporate internationally. I have a healthy social life, I founded a company across three countries. I don't know why now on drugs I've unburied this all.

Since this weekend I’ve noted she stopped inviting me to social events and had withdrawn.

I tried to arrange a call her to discuss this and we had the following [conversation](https://imgur.com/a/OLFxDtO). She clearly wanted to stay together, and for me to get the help I need, but I ended it after responding poorly to some of the sentiments she expressed.

She questioned if she can have a family with me. She suggested I was a threat to her safety. This is a legitimate response given the confession but I felt abandoned after trusting her.  Days before she said she wanted to have a family together.

My Doctor who is also a veteran advised not to use MDMA at all without a trained professional. He expressed it is very common for traumatic memories to rise up for processing during an MDMA experience. It is one of the primary known effects of the substance. I've scheduled in a counselor to get the appropriate treatment.

Was my decision too sensitive?

Should I respond to her and express the background or leave her be?

She logged into FB and for something related to a rental property my MIL owns.   She never logged out and I told her that after I noticed messages from some off her friends.  She said I don't have anything to hide and didn't do anything.  Well curiosity got the better of me, I know I invaded privacy, and I shouldn't have.  But an ex husband of one of her friends was in there, he made an inappropriate comment to her and she rejected it, but i went back further.  He made a comment about her dating a woman before we met, she replied I prefer men, and also said does sharing bed with a man and woman count?  He replied, ""Did you like it?"" She: it was different, then they talked about kissing women, she said she was turned on by a kiss.  I am not worried that she may have been into woman or experimented,  i am more concenred that she has told me she only kissed a woman and it tasted wierd.

relationship_advice,"I (M22) recently found an ex-girlfriend (F21) being very open on Tinder, do I have a moral obligation to say something?","I realize this is a forum for current relationships, but I figure advice is advice.

The girl in question goes to school in the same area, and we saw each other for about a year around '18. I've moved on, and have had a couple other fulfilling relationships since then.

However, I've recently starting putting myself out on Tinder, and had to stop when I came across her profile. It wasn't even the bio with TMI or the tastefully revealing Guy Fieri costume that got to me. It was the fact that she made her first picture and image of her in pasties and a facial mask with a bottle of Jim Beam. 

Now I realize self-expression is just fine and I should judge myself before others, but I feel like she's betraying herself by buying into that ""college girl gone wild"" image. She can be more interesting than than that, and I feel it'll only get her the wrong kind of attention.

In all likelihood I'll just forget about it. But it got me thinking about my role as an ex-boyfriend, and if I should still speak up when I see people I loved (and still care about) doing things like this. Hope people here can shed some light."
relationship_advice,I (19F) dont know if my boyfriend (21M) still cares about me.,"Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.

I dont know what to think about my relationship.

I met my current boyfriend in june 2019 on tinder (He lives 50km away from me). Chatting was fun, but we couldn't meet bc I went to another country to work for 3 months. We kept in touch for all that time, we send each other pics, talked about our days etc. He even woke up everyday at 5am to send me a good moring text to make my day better at work. Eventually we deleted tinder and promised each other that we will date once Im back in my country and that when we see each other for the first time we will kiss. That was weird, bc we never saw each other irl, but I just felt so happy. When I got back none of us had time to meet, I started college and he has his own company and is a volunteer. Finally we had our first date in december. We had sex and stayed up all night to talk plus he asked me to be his gf in an offical way. He said that ever since he met me he sees his future in brighter colors, and sometimes joked about living together. That was our only encounter, I havent seen him for almost 2 months by now. He always have to cancel our plans bc something is up, I know that he has a lot of work and is really busy, but I feel so alone now. He started to be cold and distant and stopped to tell me that he loves me nor ask for pictures. When I ask him if I can call he always says he does not have time. If I dont start a convo then we wont talk. 

I dont know if Im beeing needy and toxic or if he is just playing me. Im scared to confront him (I have a trauma and I hate fights, my brain stops working when someone is angry at me). I dont know what to do, I feel like Im worthless and that nobody needs me. I hate how I feel rn, but I care about him so much.

Should I tell him how I feel? Im so scared of the thought that he just used me, but if he did then he wouldnt still reply to me, right? Sometimes I that I would be better of alone. 

Please tell me how should I act now, and how do you interpret this situation."
relationship_advice,How can I show someone I am not interested??,"As the title says, I met this person who I know for sure is interested in me. However I don’t feel the same towards them. And for some reason I just feel so suffocated and don’t know how to get myself out of it. We are just friends, and I made sure to hint that since the beginning. From the way they talk they make it seem as if we’re more even tho I did not give any consent. I just feel like I can’t breathe and I want to get out of it soon but in a polite respectful way"
relationship_advice,I (24M) am trying to get girlfriend (20F) back via no contact method but we are at the same workplace and I need some advice,"Me and this girl dated for almost two years, during which the entire time she spoke constantly about getting married and it seemed like she was really in love with me. We had a lot of fights in our relationship and we didn’t always see eye to eye but she always maintained that she was absolutely in love with me, up until two days before breaking up with me we were getting along as well as ever and she was so happy that I had Christmas with all her family and she was telling me how happy she was with me. Then she came over and broke up with me seemingly out of the blue, after almost two years it turns out she had lost feelings ‘in the last month’ and she decided we were done. She cheated on me three times with a guy from her other workplace (which she has now left) when we had been seeing each other for two months non stop and she was telling me that she was in love with me (and then didn’t tell me about the cheating for six months) and I held onto resentment from that for absolutely ages and became an insecure mess. I just wish she had been honest with me right away so it didn’t turn into a whole ordeal that lasted almost a year. After we sorted all that out I then found out from her friends earlier last year that she was complexly flirty with guys at clubs and let them grind on her etc, and they kept having to tell people she has a boyfriend to which she told them ‘my boyfriend doesn’t mind.’ She maintains her behaviour was fine but all her friends tell me differently. I then went out with her once and she got drunk and kissed two other guys and then screamed at me about it because she said it wasn’t her fault and how dare I blame her when she was drunk. (I got far too drunk once and even though I didn’t kiss anyone she said that’s the exact same thing and so we’re equal). She wouldn’t understand why I didn’t like her going out because if she acted like that when I was there, how badly would she behave when I am not there? But I just came across as controlling: She also goes to church every Sunday and her family are extremely religious, and she told me she can’t date me if I don’t go to church, I went every now and then but not often enough for her liking which she is using as one of the main reasons for realising that ‘I am not right for her and she shouldn’t have started dating me in the first place.’ We had sex and she slept over 3 or so times a week and she is on the lease at my house but she changed her mind about moving in at the last second because she said it is ‘not appropriate for a Christian and she needs someone with better morals than me.’ Basically, she wanted to be able to sleep over and have sex but not have to tell her parents and family that she lives with me. She said she is breaking up with me to focus on being a better Christian, yet her first weekend as a single she was out clubbing wearing basically nothing and posting bragging about how she was drinking. Now, despite all those incidents for 95% of the time she was a great girlfriend and I am quite insecure and she put up with a lot of my anxiety. She did take care of me in a lot of ways and I like to think I always took care of her too. I don’t have any friends of family and so she became my only support system and I guess she got sick of it. Since we broke up she has seemed completely indifferent to me, she isn’t even angry or resentful, she honestly just acts like she doesn’t even care, like it’s not worth her time to even worry about the break up. She truly seems as happy as I’ve ever seen her. It has been one month since the break up and I keep hearing that going no contact is the best way to make someone miss you. The issue is I have to see her at work almost every single day. Usually just for changeover of shifts but sometimes working directly together. I also told her I’d go to church every Sunday so she will see me there even if we don’t speak. I try to keep things polite and civil at work when she tries to start conversation, but without seeming overly enthusiastic or keen. Now, we have a snap streak of 695 which we have maintained, and my question is will keeping the snap streak be completely detrimental to the effectiveness of no contact, or since we see each other at work all the time will it not make a difference? I know it’s childish but she is obsessed with Snapchat and I feel like maybe deep down she is attached to the streak (although she says she doesn’t care) and will keeping the streak ruin my chances of effective no contact by sending one snap a day, or will keeping that high number actually work to my advantage so it feels like we are still connected? What if we haven’t spoken for a month but she sees it’s over 700 and she starts to miss me, compared to it being 0. I’m grasping at straws, I know. It seems like I should let her go but the fact is I love her and want to give her space so she can come back. I just need some no contact advice please."

relationship_advice,"Been together almost four years, but i've never felt so alone.","Me (26F) and my fiance (29M) have been together almost four years, and everything has been good, we have our ups and our downs like every relationship but since middle of last year until now, things have changed. He started up school and has been pretty busy, and i work a lot as well so we dont really see each other. About a month ago we got into fight because i wanted to spend more time together since the only time we had was when we went to bed, but he would sleep on the couch. Three years of sleeping next to each other and then sleeping on the couch. Why? 

So that fight happened, which then he told me he cant be around me most of the time. We hurt my feelings but i guess i nagged too much about the couch thing, so i stepped back a bit. Then he wasnt coming home for like three days at a time, and I worry, which ended up in another fight because he didnt just text me to say he wasnt coming home, he just left without saying anything for three days. I dont care where he goes or what he does, all i ask is peace of mind. 

Anyway, at the moment he doesnt spend one night at home, he comes home for a couple hours and then he stays somewhere else. When he is home for those couple hours, he doesnt come out and greet me like he use to, hugs and kisses. He is just distant and closed off, i try and be affectionate but i can tell he doesnt want that or want me around. Im not sure what to do, i feel like if i bring it up he just pulls away and if i leave him to figure out whats going on in his mind he will pull away even more. 

I want to be with him, and have him home at night, ive become so lonely that I cry every night when i go to bed alone. Im engaged to someone that doesnt want to be around me.
I'm honestly not sure what to do in this situation. Any advice would be appreciated."
relationship_advice,Do you think my ex will ever come back?,"My bf(18m) broke up with me(18f) 3 days ago telling that I’m emotionally abusing him. I tried everything that I can do to make him change his mind. He was so in love with me, he always said we will be together (get married have children). I don’t know and I cannot understand what changed. I gave him chance, but he doesn’t want to give me. I love him so much and I just want him to come back. He even bought my Valentine’s Day gift but he decided to break up. Last time he said if you love me respect my decision, so I’m stuck I can’t text him anymore. Does he need time? Will he come back?"
relationship_advice,My [31M] gf [26F] using inheritance money to buy luxury car,"My girlfriend's uncle (who was estranged from the rest of her family) left her an inheritance of $30,000 and left a note suggesting she buy a new car with it before he passed away. My girlfriend and her family are not well off financially and I have been supporting her for the last two years while shes in school. And my girlfriend does not have a reliable car. She asked me what kind of car she should buy and I said that she should buy a reliable 2016 model of some sort from one of the Japanese brands and either save the rest of the money or give it to her parents. After a few days she comes back and tells me that she will be using the entire 30k to buy a used German luxury sedan. The more I think about this, the more it rubs me the wrong way. First, she doesn't have much or if any savings. Second, her parents could definitely use some of the money, and third if she doesn't want to do any of the first two options she could help me out as I am paying for most if not all her living expenses. I told her what I thought about this and she says its because either I'm jealous or resents her for supporting her (which I have never brought up in the last two years I've been doing it). I don't think anything shes ever done has turned me off to her character as much as this. Am I making a big deal out of nothing or is she not thinking straight?"
relationship_advice,23F and 22M- Is this gaslighting/Manipulation,"The other day I had a particularly rough day at work. I suffer from severe anxiety and often get physical symptoms that leave me feeling exhausted, nauseous, and foggy. The mental fog was present for most of the day. Due to not having transportation my bf takes me to and from work.As a precaution I texted my bf to let him know that I wasn't feeling well and that I would appreciate going straight home to relax.Upon picking me up from work he insists on going to the grocery store so I could go ahead and get what I needed to cook us dinner, along with some toys for his dog. As I am paying for the stuff he asks me if I have called the bank to receive my new debit card as I had lost it. The way he asked was phrased in a way that made me feel as though he doesn't think I'm being responsible. I told him I knew I needed to take care of it, but that I've been stressed and I would probably try tomorrow. I did get quiet on the walk to the car as I was feeling guilty that I am not handling the things I need to. I was also still feeling foggy. He asks me if he said something to offend me- very pointedly and rolls his eyes exclaiming that he didn't mean anything by it and that I shouldn't be so sensitive. I tell him that I/m not upset and that I have a bit of a headache and that he didn't offend me. I repeated that I was just worried because I knew there were things I had to take care of, but I wasn't feeling up to it and would much rather go home and relax.
He did not respond. I figured I made him upset so I sat quietlynduring the 5 minute car ride to his parents house to see the dog.
we get there, he asks again if he has offended me, asks again about the bank. I respond again that I know i have to take care of it, I am a little stressed but I will call tomorrow and that he didn't offend me. For some reason he blows up, says I have an attitude and that all I do is talk circles around him and lie about my headaches when I can't just admit that I'm offended.
He proceeds to walk out the door and slam it, I follow him out and he is screaming profanities at me, insisting that I am manipulative and play mind games with him- talking circles around him and lying about how I feel. I try to apologize but I am so confused by what is happening. He screams at me to get in the car and once inside starts to scream and hit me. I come close to a panic attack and out of sheer fear that he will continue berating me I head towards his parent's house again. He catches me before I can go inside, picks me up and throws me to the ground while slapping me in the head repeatedly and calling me a stupid bitch. I again try to go in his parent's house seeking some sanctuary because I feel like I cannot handle this kind of interaction today as I was already hyper anxious. 
Long story short- his parents get involved and essentially sit and watch him yell at me for an hour about how I am manipulative and terrible. 
Now his parents do not want me to ever come by again and he is saying that it is all my fault because I wanted to cause a scene. 
I just wanted a fair chance to apologize without having to duck blows and hear that I am less than human. 
I feel absolutely crazy because I know this wasn't that big of a deal , yet now his parents never want to see me again, and he is saying that this whole scenario was just for show and that I have no respect for him."

But I have this crush on an older guy at my work, he’s 20 years older than me and I don’t know why I feel this way. I would never cheat on my boyfriend and I know he’s the one for me but I feel guilty for having this crush. It’s more like a fantasy.

It is difficult for both of us, but we communicate our needs and both agree on creating non-physical intimate moments in other ways. However, I'm having problems coming up with more.

relationship_advice,"Is my GF(27), who just moved in, a undercover gold digger or is she lacking relationship experience?","I’ve been with my gf for a year and a half. Her and I met on tinder in the US, we kicked it off when we first met and we have been together since. When we first started dating, my living situation was terrible because I lived with my brother, who didn’t want anyone coming over to his house. So for the first year of our relationship, we spent some weekends in 4/5 star hotels so we could have sex and have alone time. I’ve met her parents, and along the way we’ve got to really know each other. I opened up to her about me being molested as a child, and my lack of belief in God. In a way, her and I do not see eye to eye on a lot of things like religion, sex, and intimacy. She is a very sweet and kind person overall, but there have been times where she snaps at me for being to touchy with her. I’ve met all her friends and they all say I’m lucky to have her. She’s currently in school finishing up her last year to be an architect. Her living situation was screwed up too with very strict parents, and she had never moved out of the house. I convinced her that we should move in together and just start our lives together. I work in business strategy consulting and I make mid six figures, she has seen my lifestyle and knows that I can have anything (material) in life. She knows I help my family financially and knows I am a very generous person. I’ve always taken her to eat and some of the best places, without having her pay, ever. Her financial situation is kinda bad so I took that into account the first year. Well I decided to leave my toxic brothers house this year and get an apartment. We moved in this month, and I can’t help to notice her lack of intimacy with me. She’s also brought up the fact that she doesn’t want to work and that she would rather be a full time student. I agreed with her that I would pay the entire rent, bills, and food for our place. I travel and work from him often so I find myself cooking and cleaning a lot more than her since she’s in school more often than not. Since we moved in I have noticed that she doesn’t like me touching her too much nor does she like having sex as often as I thought she would. She seems to be good with me when I take her out or when I’m paying for something, but when we’re at home it almost feels like she has no interest in me. Last night I asked her if she could shave her legs because they were prickly, she instantly saw it as a move for me to try to have sex with her and stated that she always has to shave for me and that she does it to please me. So I’ve been a little confused with her behavior and I’m not sure if I’m either overthinking it or I’m being taken advantage of. What do you all think?"

relationship_advice,Girl wasting my time or?,"

Girl used to reply fast now only replies at night?

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn’t slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don’t understand if she’s losing interest shouldn’t she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I’m deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I’m going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I’m just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?"
relationship_advice,Me (17) and my bf (19) of 1.4 years are having major issues and I though we were forever,"Me and my bf have been together for a while now, we moved quickly from the start are are long distance by 2hrs. We’ve been taking about our future together for a while now and i plan to be with him for a long time.

Despite the long distance he still comes to see me every weekend, but recently his company has changed. We used to spend time driving around smoking and talking, having fun and chilling but now my boyfriend has quit smoking weed after doing it every day for the past 2 years we’re Ive been doing every day for the past year under this influence, now I’m a stoner and I don’t have much problem with it, but I live in a small town and there not much to do so now we just chill at home and it’s boring. 

Since my boyfriend is 20 he’s now going threw the phase in life we’re he’s wanting to grow, learn and he’s an entrepreneur so he constantly has new business ideas and tells him how much me about them for 30m to and hour at a time when half the time I have no idea what he says or I’m uninterested. Instead of spending time smoking and hanging out with friends he now reads books and meditates. He used to have free time constantly and worked a couple hours a week but now he has a full time job which gives him very little time with me. And we speak on the phone for maybe 30m-1hr a when before it was multiple hours, we don’t even ft overnight anymore. 

So to say the least his personality is completely different and on top of that he loves raves, party’s and the club and even the idea of any of that intimidates. He’s always focused on talking about the future but a lot of the time what he’s saying sounds unrealistic. 

I’m scared being with him is going to compromise my life and that I’ll be living his life instead of mine, I’m still young young and I don’t want to live a life that isn’t meant for me...."
relationship_advice,I [30F] can't stand my boyfriend's [35M] cat - not sure I can deal with living this way!,"Three months ago I moved in with my boyfriend who I absolutely adore. I can see myself with him for the rest of my life. There's just one issue.... his cat.   


I absoutely love animals and my family dog has always been the centre of our home, so I do totally understand why my boyfriend adores his pet. But everyday, I find living with the cat harder and harder, and when I think about the future it actually makes me feel a drop in the pit of my stomach knowing the next 10+ years of my life will be spent with this cat.   


I work from home and everyday my boyfriend will come home and ask me how the cat was that day. I've got to a point now when I just refuse to answer his question because ultimately the cat has always been a nightmare - he bites, he scratches, he destroys EVERYTHING. My boyfriend will pick him up and cuddle him and say 'look at my cat' all twee and it absolutely riles me everytime. He wants me to coo over the animal that does nothing but destroy my home, hiss at me and bite me. I spend hours on the internet trying to learn how to do things to help the situation and everything I suggest is constantly met with 'why are you being mean to the cat?'   


The cat has medical issues (he's undergoing treatment) which means he's sick once or twice a day. I work from home so I spend a good half an hour of my working day sponging the carpet (which has already been destroyed by scratching) which the cat tries to bite me as I do it. Our carpet is like a patchwork of vomit or bleach stains, it makes me sad to be in my own home, but any time I try and tell my boyfriend this he gets mad at me, saying 'its not his fault he's sick, why are you so nasty about him?' He also sleeps in the bed with us and waking up with a furry tail in my mouth is disgusting, but my boyfriend claims he's always slept in the bed and will scratch and whine unless he is allowed on the bed. I'm a bit scared of him and can't relax in my home properly. I've told my boyfriend this, but he just thinks I'm being ridiculous. If I complain I'm exhausted because the cat has woken me up scratching or meowing three times through the night, my boyfriend will say 'thats nothing compared to having a baby' - but its not my baby! Our flat is constatly covered in fur and cat litter and I can smell it when I get home, but every time I mention it I get a lecture about how cats categorically do not smell.  


My boyfriend had the cat before I met him and he constantly will say 'this is just what he's like' to justify any of his bad behaviour. I'd like to have kids at some point in the next 5 years, but the thought of the cat being anywhere near my baby, or me being at home alone during maternity leave with a baby and this cat, genuinely upsets me. It makes me think I'm never going to be able to have the future I want. I know this might sound dramatic, but everyday it is really starting to get me down and make me doubt everything. I love my boyfriend and want to be with him, but I don't know if I can live with his cat, and I'd hate to put him in a position where he felt I was giving him a 'me or the cat' ultimatum. Is there anything I can do or is this going to inevitibly put a wedge inbetween us?"
relationship_advice,Fear,"So Recently I went through the motions of my ex breaking up with me

The love in the relationship wasn’t real for him and he tried to force something out of something that was never there

He admitted it wasn’t working but was always indecisive 

I always felt after there were periods of closeness and distance. Always had this feeling but I kept pushing it away

Him not visiting me in the hospital, making excuses to ask me to be his girlfriend after 6 months. Throwinf concert tickets that I spent a fortune on in the bin because it was cold outside and he’d rather stay in despite telling him we’d be going out and he was okay with it before. Running around for him to get something like he told me, only for him to tell me he didn’t want it. Telling me true love is when your gf forget her keys and he has to go running to go and get it for her from a mile away. I asked if he’d do anything like that for me and he said no. He said he’d never protect me in a street fight because he could get stabbed.   Making excuses for withdrawing kisses (my lips are cold etc) making excuses for why he didn’t want to meet my parents yet, mentioning his ex, calling his ex his girlfriend or his wife by accident. So many things. 

Eventually he told me he didn’t want to hear that I felt used in the relationship over the last 3 weeks after the breakup so came clean. “I don’t want you to say you were being used. That’s why I didn’t have sex with you”

I have an awful relationship with my mother. A toxic one infact. My grandmother told me she hates me and also told me that my father doesn’t like me (my mother’s mother) and he treats my siblings better. My father loves me but I always thought what if he doesn’t and she confirmed my thoughts 

I also have bulimia and my ex used to tell me to stop training my quads (I had a name for being quadzilla because I had big quads because I did a fair bit of bodybuilding. And I liked them”

Then he went and liked pictures of girls with big steroid quads , I asked him why and he said that he likes to draw and they looked nice to draw

Many times in the relationship i normalised things that were wrong. Now I don’t know what is right and what is not

I’m scared to meet people because of this. I’m scared (also because precious relationships were the same) that no one will love me enough. I also have vaginismus and it’s been a dealbreaker. For everyone except him

Now I have 2 things to worry about. How do I get over my fear. He’s behind breaking my confidence down little by little. Every day. I started off happy. Doing things independently. I can barely do things by myself now"
relationship_advice,I found out my boyfriend is about to propose it's causing me to fantasize about other men,"I've (24f) been dating my boyfriend (23m) for almost three years now. We met in college via a dating app while I was in a weird time of my life. I had just had an abortion and was a bit depressed. We immediately hit it off right after the first date, and were pretty much inseparable after. Following graduation he got a job that required us to be in a long distance relationship for 8 months which almost made us fall even more in love. Afterwards it ended up that he was able to move back to exactly where I was living. The cards just kept falling in place for us. Now we are living together for almost a year. 

I recently found out (just by guessing because he is awful at hiding anything from me) that he asked my dad for his blessing to propose to me. There's a bit of drama surrounding the proposal in my family because I am the youngest of my siblings + my oldest sibling has been dating the same person for almost 8 years and has yet to be married... Anyways ever since finding out I've been having severe cold feet. I told him I think that we should wait a few times maybe not as convincing as I thought I said it. But one day we are at my family's house and my boyfriend was forcing me to get my nails done the night before and I just had an inkling that he might be trying to propose. I figured out before he did it and pleaded him to wait. 

Simultaneously I had been texting/snapping a former college hook up for a few days (drunkenly sent a few nudes). But I now can't stop thinking about him. He just moved to new city and also has a girlfriend, but I cannot stop thinking about him. I find myself fantasizing about moving away and have even played around with looking at flights. I know he's not into me very much at all, but I can't stop. I have even thought about him during sex with my current boyfriend. Am I just projecting?!"
relationship_advice,I don’t know if I should stay friends with my best friend.. (21F),"I don’t even know where to start with this. Nothing big has ever gone down between us, it’s just so many little things that make me look at her much differently than I use to. Of corse I know people drift apart but she (22F) doesn’t want to drift apart. She wants to stay best friends forever but I don’t think our friendship will work. We won’t see each other for months, which is fine because we get busy, We both have a full time jobs and go to school. So it’s fine when scheduling doesn’t match up. But when we do get together which is only every few months she always has some opinions about my life and what’s happening with it((it’s been things about my choice to get married, the pets I have and care for)) And it just bothers me because she never asks about things before she starts spewing opinions. It’s not like when we are apart she even texts me to check in and see how things are. I’m the one who would do that, Altho I don’t anymore tho because I’m just don’t trying. I don’t know if she just wants to act better than me? Maybe she wants her life to be like mine? I recently got married and I feel like things have been extra weird sense then. All she ever talks about is wanting a boyfriend and everything that comes with it. But she won’t take any advise when it comes to guys. All she wants to do it sleep with them and I almost think it’s a problem. Like she doesn’t know how to have a relationship and only knows sex. I have no issues with her sleeping with many men, it’s completely her choice but I also feel it has messed with her emotions. Like she thinks sex is going to fill the need of love she wants? I try so hard to be there for her but she does the same things to herself over and over again then turns around to say something about my life. Which is going great btw. I have a loving husband and we’re getting ready to move into a house, I’ve started my new job and things are just going all around well, which it honestly a first for me. And o don’t have many friends at all.. it’s hard to find good trustworthy people and I don’t want to lose the ones I have but idk if I can take the criticism much more. 

Yikes I know this is all over the place but idk who to tell all this to. Someone give me some advise."
relationship_advice,My wife is mad at me for dedicating a room in our house to Fury Road,"It's a room that wasn't used for anything. We got 2 kids and they both have their own rooms. I recently completed my collection of Fury Road posters and my wife had complained about both the posters and how I show the movie every Friday at 8 pm. I figured I would kill two birds with one stone and cleaned out this empty room, then I bought a Cerwin-Vega home theater system and a tv. 

I hung the posters all around the room, placed all the Fury Road merchandise and then installed the tv and home theater. Then I started blasting. I put the movie on repeat on high volume on January 17th and it has been blasting ever since. We don't have wall to wall neighbors, so no one has complained. 

My wife thinks it's annoying to walk past the room while the movie is blasting 24/7, but I think it's very nice to have Immortan Joe's armada living with us, almost like a family member. Anyhow, how do I convince my wife that this is an awesome idea? She thinks the movie is good, but I want her to think it's the greatest thing anyone has ever created. The pinnacle of humanity. 

I'm going to keep blasting it either way, but I still would prefer it if my wife was fully on board."
relationship_advice,Need Advice. 31F wanting a very quiet wedding. Mom 65F is upset that she isn't getting the wedding she dreamed of for her daughter,"Here's the situation. I will be marrying my LDR Fiance (40M) in April. We are from different countries, and want to get started on building our life together. Neither of us had ""Marriage"" on our list of life goals so while I love him and CANNOT WAIT to call him my husband, and vice versa, we are not looking for some big to do for our union. We are getting married at City Hall in his town, and due to work, I cannot even stay on our wedding night. All we want is a quiet ceremony, for our parents to be there, cause neither of us can imagine taking that from them, but that's it.   


We DO plan on throwing get togethers afterwards with friends and extended family. But this isn't good enough for my mom. I am her only daughter and she is now claiming that all my aunts and uncles, my grandma (dads side, whom she doesn't even talk to cause my parents split up 20 years ago), my cousins all want to come to our little rush wedding. For context, I am getting married at 2 PM on a Monday and have to catch a flight back home that evening at 7 PM. . At this point I've caved and given into demands for a wedding outfit (Not a gown, but I ordered a cute cream dress that at least touches on tradition). She's now pushing me to send out invites so I can see how many people would want to come, but I don't want them to. Maybe that makes me an AH but, I never dreamed of a wedding, I don't like being the center of attention and my fiance doesn't want what I don't want.   


Now, I thought I could get through to my mom, I thought she knew me better than that. She said that she always dreamed of my wedding and thought it would never happen and now it is, and she wants whats best for me. This is mine and my fiance's day, not hers. Whats best for us is to get married quietly, cause that is what we want. Fiance won't touch this with a ten foot pole (can't blame him) since he doesn't want to get on my moms bad side, but I am hoping for advice on how to convince her that his isn't her day or accomplishment. I am on edge and want to treat it as any other day, and am on the verge to just tell her not to come, but I will admit that that isn't what I want. She is in NO WAY being malicious about it, but every time we talk, she turns our discussion into convincing me to invite at least ALL of our family. I suppose I am hoping for some advice on how to gently convince her to stop. I really don't want to have a fight with her over it. I am on cloud nine for the most part, and never thought I would even be excited at the prospect of marriage, but here I am, really looking forward to joining my life with him, and I want to avoid tainting this memory with a blow out with my mom. Maybe I should just let her keep trying to convince me and just ignore it? Try and change the subject all the time? Its eventually going to be too late to invite people. I HIGHLY doubt she will go behind my back and try to invite people. But as you can tell, the thought has crossed my mind so maybe it might for her too. Any thoughts on how to navigate this will be extremely appreciated. And sorry for the long read.   


TLDR - Getting married, mom wants me to invite the world, while I just want a quiet city hall hitching with just our parents. She spends every waking moment"
relationship_advice,What was he trying to say?,"What was he trying to say? Me and my boyfriend were talking. He was telling me that if I needed to confide in someone cut he and I were having problems in our relationship, he wouldn’t be mad. We had a big fight so it made me think that he’d done it or was thinking of talking to someone. I said I didn’t like that idea. You don’t confide in anybody, you haikus just talk to each other about things. Then he said the only thing he could think of is if he was afraid of telling me something that would hurt my feelings, he’d need advice on how to tell me. It was just random to me."
relationship_advice,Ex-FWB [27/F] is dating a close friend [28/M] only he doesn't know we hooked up OR about her history as a Sugar Baby. I don't know what to do,"I've known ""Tijana"" since we were teenagers. Our parents put us in the same community center to learn about our heritage. We were always friends and remain so. Tijana's family is a bit odd, her parents were older when they had her and had struggled for years before making it to the States. They're nice, but just a bit odd. Ti is good at getting what she wants. She's not manipulative, but she can convince people of pretty much whatever she wants. We had a bit of a fling when we were both in community college and hooked-up for the better part of two years. She then moved on when I got into a relationship and she began seeing this older guy. He'd put her up in hotels in really swanky places, like Miami and San Francisco and he'd fly to meet her for sexy times. She did this for years. He bought her clothes, cars, and just straight up gave her cash. He got sick a few years back - she said that she never saw him drink water, only cutty sark and that he smoked like a chimney. His illness wasn't a surprise. I knew from friends that she had multiple guys doing this at one point. She had applied for work, didn't find anything, so spent her time traveling from one hotel to another to meet up with these guys. They gave her endless gifts and first class travel and for probably 6 years that was her full-time job. How she met these rich guys, I don't know. Once they became inconvenient or had other issues, she 'dumped' them. She now has enough money saved that she still doesn't work, and it looks like her new boyfriend will solve a lot of those problems. 

Anyway, I only knew of Ti's exploits through friends. I see her only very occasionally and that means probably once a year. My parents would give me updates about her every now and again when they'd bump into her parents. I guess a couple of weeks ago my mom bumped into her mom at a Polish deli they both swear they never go to and Ti's mom lays it out there that she's dating this new guy, an American, and goes on to drop the granddaddy of all brags - *he's a lawyer*. In our community, the ""big win"" is to move abroad, become Americanized enough to marry a local who happens to be well educated and have good earning potential. My guess is Ti's parents probably took out ad space in all the local papers announcing their great news. 

I checked out Ti's social media and immediately recognized the guy. I met him in university. We studied the same thing and agreed to always do our group projects together because we worked so well as a team. I graduated, went to work, and grad school, but he went on to law school. He's a really nice guy, genuinely kind and really easy going. I was surprised when he told me he wanted to go to law school, but he's made a success of it. He has a great job, seems to have it together and when we're together, he's always a great laugh. We hadn't seen each other in a while - I'm working and he's working, and I figured Ti and him hadn't been together *that* long; but, I saw on IG that she's moved him out his apartment and into her apartment. He basically 'gave up' his stuff and she posted about how ""he was hers forever"" with a caption in our native language saying something along the lines of ""a girl gets what she wants."" 

Ti is, deep down, a good person. She had a really troubled start - her dad was 'inconvenient' during the 80s and had trouble getting work; they struggled during the 90s and first wound-up in Canada where her dad's degrees weren't recognized and he word first as a taxi driver and then as a technician and then moved here in the very late-90s and settled. It took them years to sort of get settled and for a while they relied heavily on help from the community, even with basics like food. They do well now and her father is an engineer, but I think the early years marked her and so Ti is always obsessed with stability, money, prestige and having control over situations. 

But, because of how we were raised, we're a bit like chameleons and I'm sure she's never mentioned the hotels, the money and the men before. She also probably never mentioned a lot. I didn't really say anything, but spoke with some mutual friends who all felt that someone should say something to this guy - I let it slip that I knew him and friends are looking to me to let him know. I'm not convinced it'll make anything better for him with all that knowledge and it may just ruin their relationship. I wouldn't want to hear how a friend had slept with my girlfriend, or a cadre of rich fat guys who wanted to feel young by plowing a girl in exchange for money. She was 18 or 19 when she started (I think there was overlap between me and her sugar daddies) and I don't think actually 'dated' anyone until this guy. 

I'm really conflicted and not at all sure what to do here."
relationship_advice,How do I (29M) respond to my ex (27F) giving me my Christmas gifts back?,"I always found returning gifts after a breakup a very irritating concept, it's maybe one of the most common moves in when a relationship ends, some people put old things in a box, others throw them, some return them.

What irritates me about it is the fact that a person puts their own time to think, make, and/or buy these gifts, and then they get them back.

While I won't discuss the morality nor how to deal with it, what do I (29M) respond to my ex (27F) who is giving me a box of all my Christmas gifts soon?, she is moving out after a year of living together, I saw the box on the table and I know she is gonna leave it, I hate the fact that she is keeping it for m too. I was extremely busy when I bought these gifts, and flew a continent to see her and gave them to her, one of the gifts is also a unique thing bought in one of my trips for her after knowing her only for couple of months, when I sadly thought she is the one."
relationship_advice,Life is so good right now but my (29/F) boyfriend (29/M) wants to move to a different country.,"I have to premise by saying that during this time every year, my boyfriend goes through what seems like depression or a mid-life crisis. We've been together for nearly 4 years (also living together for that duration).

This time around, we're in a really good place — 

I have a great career with the perfect life balance that allows me to also devote time to my hobbies, I have 7 weeks paid vacation, and an above average pay cheque. My boyfriend left his old job where he was making above average, working only 4-day weeks, and he loved everyone he worked with, for the dream company of his industry, making a significant amount more for less work, but now he hates the people he works with. Understandably though because they're a bunch of entitled and lazy twats.

He complains about his job daily. I've already told him that if he wanted to leave his current job and go back or find a new one, I'd support him. It's not about the money at all for me. I like to live within  means and we can live off of an average cheque.

We have a trip coming up in March going to Europe — specifically where his parents are from. My boyfriend was born in North America. But he goes back to their country to visit almost every year. Only his grandparents live there now. But suddenly he's asking me how I would react if we went and then he decided he wanted to stay permanently and not come back to NA with me. He says he wants to live a simple life with no big buildings, no traffic, not more than 3 people walking on the street. He wants less human interaction.

It's a beautiful country, don't get me wrong. But I don't speak the language, we have such a good life in NA already, my family (who I'm very much attached to) lives here, his family lives here, and I have a career here that doesn't translate well (to my knowledge) overseas. Would I consider it in the future? Absolutely. I would be 100% down to go if I was married to him already. Would I consider it now? No. I don't want to be away from my family and give up everything for a man who hasn't even committed to me like that yet. I don't know what to do. I think his job is a major reason as to why he's feeling this way, but it'd be nice to get more perspectives.

TLDR; We have it so good right now. Great jobs, just bought a pre-construction home, lots of money saved... but my boyfriend is seriously considering moving to Europe because he prefers a simple life away from the city, traffic, and basically first-world. I do not speak the language of the only country he is considering. I don't want to move but I don't want to break up or do LDR either. What can I do to convince him that life here is better for us, at least for right now?"
relationship_advice,Mixed signals??,"I recently told a friend I've had for years that I liked her. We texted pretty much everyday for like 3 years and I just decided I had to know instead of wasting anymore time. I told her I liked her and she told me she would never have guessed in a million years even though we both were quite flirty at times and I would try to initiate physical contact such as hand on thigh etc while hanging out.  Anyways, literally the next day she is still texting me about plans we made to hangout like a week ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I should just kind of start distancing myself away since I don't want to waste more time, but she still messages me like every morning and wants to hang out? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just extremely confused.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."
relationship_advice,My (28f) boyfriend (31m) believed I’m still in love with a boyfriend that committed suicide.,"We have been together for almost 2 years. I have rarely mentioned him, but only a few times, naturally when it comes up.  Last night we got into a fight that ripped me to my core... I brought up his name, and he got so upset... he said if he ever hears his name come out of my mouth again he is ending things. 
It has been almost 8 years since his death, and I have mourned him correctly. 
He said last night ,”I feel like if he was still alive, you would be with him.” 
I love my boyfriend more than anything, but I’m hurt."
relationship_advice,How can I (24m) get my coworkers to STOP commenting on my weight loss??,"I deliberately lost a lot of weight in a short period of time (56kg, half my body weight) and ended up kind of skinny. I was previously obese.

During the weight loss and now, my coworkers have not stopped commenting on it and I'm getting increasingly annoyed. Most of my coworkers are older women, but even the men and young people all have something to say.  I understand the change is quite dramatic but it's also none of their business.

At first the comments motivated me, but now I'm getting uncomfortable with it. 
I've been asked if I'm ill so many times, I've even been pulled aside by managers to ask if I was taking drugs. 

The older ladies try to feed me, I know it's just mothering instincts but sometimes they get sad when I can't eat it. I bring my lunch to work, everything is weighed and calorie counted so I'm not going to eat random snacks from the vending machine.

I've tried to politely tell them to stop but it hasn't worked. I know I've changed, I'm more serious now, but I had to change to meet my goals and it feels sometimes that they're jealous that they can't lose weight themselves.

TLDR; lost a lot of weight, coworkers won't leave me alone about it. Asking politely doesn't seem to work"
relationship_advice,Am I immature for not wanting to hang around someone who wanted to hook-up with my SO?,"So basically the title, I'm just not sure how to best approach the situation without appearing immature or insecure.

Some backstory, my SO and I recently went out with a group of their coworkers, and my SO drunkenly admitted to them that this person (we'll call them x) they work with was interested in hooking up with them until (x) discovered that I was in the picture. Having learned that my SO was taken, (x) ended up sleeping with a different coworker. (x) recently invited us both out to see q local show, and now that I know (x) was salivating (and probably still is) over my SO, I'm averted. I know it's not my place to tell my SO who to befriend, but I honestly don't feel comfortable participating in any social interaction with (x) myself. I haven't told my SO how I feel about it yet, but I sincerely feel my SO would not want to be in my shoes if the tables were turned."
relationship_advice,"My boyfriend said that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with me if we keep having 0 sex, according to him that relationship would just be like a 'good friendship' and he doesn't want to be 'just good friends' with me. I feel that he doesn't love me at all.","So lately I crave no sexuality in my relationship due to my depression. My boyfriend told me yesterday that he feels like our relationship is turning into be a good friendship and he doesn't want to be good friends with me only. I feel like even though he didn't want to, he made a condition which oversteps my personal boundaries. If he'd love me, he wouldn't say something like that. I've been thinking and I realised that I wouldn't say something like that to someone I love. He repeatedly tells me he loves me though, but at this point I started questioning that. I feel like he has no idea what love is. He's been very supportive throughout my depressive episodes but now I feel like he only did that to feel entitled to say something like that to me.
In a nutshell, this made me question if I still want to be in a relationship with him. I feel like he's not treating me as a person with this point of view, or he's just had enough and has different values but this is really not like how I think.
Did anyone experience anything similar? I know all stories have multiple sides and it's not easy to form an opinion. The disturbing thing is that someone would only date you if they can fuck you, otherwise they don't like you enough... That's how it looks like to me now."
relationship_advice,Am I [24F] not good enough in bed for my boyfriend [28M]?,"Tldr at the bottom. Title probably seems stupid but hear me out. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've [24F] been with my boyfriend [28M] for 4 years. Since about a year into our relationship, my boyfriend has been wanting to do anal. 

Although nervous at first, I still wanted to do it, however it was quite painful and uncomfortable when we tried so we stopped. I did research on how best to prepare myself, got what I needed and we tried again - but it was still really painful.

We've tried it a load of times with different advice but each time has been horrible, except two. Two times it was actually enjoyable, but we can't figure out what we did different for it to be enjoyable.

My boyfriend has been getting upset with me lately over it. For our most recent attempt, I bought a special product that you spray on to make anal easier. Long story short, all it did was burn and it was still painful, I ended up crying and my boyfriend stopped but gave out about how it's ridiculous I can't do it because everyone does.

He hasn't really spoken to me since then, and we definitely haven't spoken about it. Honestly, I have thought about if it's just a me problem, but I have enjoyed it a couple of times yet when we've tried to replicate it I'm still in pain.

I feel bad that I can't do this to make my boyfriend feel good, but I just wish he understood I can't just grin and bear it when I'm in pain.

So, does anyone have some advice? Is this a me problem, or do I have some way to make it work?

**Tl;dr:** Boyfriend wants butt stuff, but it hurts too much. What do now?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend (25F) cannot do her nightly routine without having every bathroom light off. (24M),"As the title says my girlfriend cannot do her nightly routine with any bathroom over head light on. We have to get ready separate every night, because I can't see that well in the dark and always turn it on. She usually turns her phone light on and gets ready with that barely lighting up the bathroom. I asked her why of course and she says it's so she doesn't pick her zits and whiteheads on her face. I just think this could be some obsessive disorder she's not treating, or some low self esteem issues that she can't look her self in the mirror at night. In the morning she can get ready with it on, it's only at night. It's just a really weird habit that I'm not sure how to address."
relationship_advice,I (30M) can't console my gf(23F) about her spooky experiences,"We have been together for almost 6 years now, since start of our relationship my gf has been telling me about her spooky experiences but I never took them seriously and mostly brushed them off as sleep paralysis or paranoia. I thought with time she will learn to stop believing in such stuff but it doesn't seem like it.

She believes that many ghosts live at her home, most spirits are good but some are bad. All females in her home has experienced being groped at night but there is nobody in their home who will do it. Plus, they all sleep with doors locked. I have never visited her home to assure her that there are no spirits, plus she says these ghosts only target females then there is no way to convince her even if I spend weeks in that home.

Now she has moved to new place for her job where she calls me at night saying she experienced something. For example, felt someone is in room, someone is outside or on roof, ""felt"" like someone is staring her from window etc. (she sleeps on 1st floor in both places). Whenever she calls, I console her to calm down but other times, I like to brush this off.

As a kid, we suffered a lot unnecessarily because my relatives and family believed in such things and wasted a lot of time and money on exorcism. When I was 13, I was told that like my uncle I will be targeted by spirits etc but soon I stopped believing in this non-sense and never experienced anything. If I rarely ever experience sleep paralysis, I never panic and go back to sleep. I wish that my gf will learn from it and stop being paranoid about these things. When we are together or when she calls me, she is fine. But I simply can't convince her to stop believing in such stuff. 

Now that I take it lightly, she has stopped telling me. Or she will say things like ""something happened but you won't believe it"" or ""I won't tell you because you wont believe it"". How can I console her about such things but still keep convincing her to stop believing?"
relationship_advice,"Is he trying to prove he cares, or that he can still have me?","I (f21) have this ex (m22) who I was very close with after our relationship. We were friends with benefits but when we get into relationships we stop communication. He’s been with this girl for a couple of months I assume, and he told me he has to block me on everything, and proceeded to do so. Every couple weeks or so, I’ll get a Snapchat notification that he added me, then to find he re blocks me within minutes or hours depending on how he feels I guess. It’s really odd and I can’t seem to find a motive. Does anyone have an idea why he would do this? It’s consistent."
relationship_advice,I[M19] cant get over relationship anxiety,"Hey guys,

I need your advice because I dont know what I should do and Im desperate.

So to get the full picture I need to beginn a little time ago . So 6 months ago I had an despressive and isolating phase.I had no human interaction after I finished my school and just was in my room only leaving it for work.Than came this girl\[F19\] that helped me get through that when all of my friends let me fall after i cut conntact.She helped me get through it and now Im over this phase and happy and do nearly every day something with my friend group . So that girl that helped me,was a girl I know a long time from the beginning of school.We share a lot of funny memories and I had an crush on her 3 years ago .I always felt a connection between us but she rejected me 3 years ago so I got over it after long time. Now she told me she has an crush on me and realised it too late and said we have so much in common,what I also think.And she told me that she thinks that it will work between us.

So now comes the problem.She isnt very experienced and so am I. And to that comes that Im scared to start something because I overthink everything and tell to me that I will not be enough and cant give her what she wants and so on.Than a week ago we talked and we were a little bit drunk and than she told me that it will not work because Im to scared and dont make a move  etc. And than it hit me and I just realised what I had done,what I have lost.She tried to start something but I always didnt went along it.She was always something special in my eyes so I was scared to ruin it like I ruin evrything in my life so maybe that is the root of my fear.Because I didnt had that problem at other girls.I also cant really assess what she thinks and so on,even tho Im normally really good at it on other people.

I dont want to lose her just because I was scared.

Have someone an advice how I can save the situation?

Or is it maybe to early for me to start something and I should first take more care of my mental health?"
relationship_advice,what counts as cuddling / snuggling?,"i (26f) have been seeing someone (28m) for a few months. things are good for the most part, but i think we have somewhat different love languages. i tend to want more physical touch than he does.

we do spend a lot of time cozied up together. but he considers lying in bed together to be snuggling, even if we're hardly touching. whereas i usually want to hold him close, be held, have my back rubbed, nuzzle against him, etc. i don't want to be physically clingy, but it's unsatisfying to be close to him without being physically affectionate.

what's an acceptable definition of cuddling / snuggling? am i asking too much?"
relationship_advice,Should I cancel or do I carry on?,"So I’ve been going out with this girl for over a month now, and when we meet up, she spends the night over at mine, but that eventually ends up being that we’re so attached to each other that she would stay for consecutive days (unhealthy ik). I enjoy the time with her but it’s only now where it’s starting to become overwhelming. All in all I think she also feels the same way.

Having spent two days with her at the beginning of the week, she was supposed to come over to my house on Saturday (tomorrow) but I told her to see me the day after since I needed some time away from her for my own interest and whatnot. I’m now concerned that it’s not enough time away from her and may consider rescheduling again. I don’t want to come across as I’m losing interest in the relationship as I do want it to work, but I also don’t want us to be fed up of each other. I do have a couple of tickets to a play coming up next week but what I don’t want is for it to be a sickly experience because we’re just so exhausted from seeing each other. 

Chances are she’ll probably spend the night at mine again if I see her which will probably be too much to handle. So do I cancel on her again? See her only for a short amount of time? I do enjoy being with her but since I’m so used to being alone, it’s quite difficult for me to adjust so quickly. 

Apologies for rambling but I’m not too sure how to word it concisely.

Tl;dr: Seeing girl I’m dating in a few days, replanned day to day after but I’m worried it might not be enough time away from each other."
relationship_advice,Is there any hope for this marriage ❤️,"I need some encouragement please. I’m trusting God but all feels lost

I was brought up in a very broken home
My Dad would beat us and my mom.
I was also raped 2 when I was a little girl by strangers 
My mother was a massive alcoholic and left my father. She was then murdered when I was 17 years old. 2 years later my younger sister died of cancer.

I met my husband when I was 19 and we had to see eachother in secret. He swept me off my feet but he had a lot of demons of his own. He was a massive drug addict which I didn’t know about till much later. He was in rehab twice over the years and sometimes he would run away from home and I would be sick to my stomach wondering where he was.

We decided to move together to a different country together. Life was great. We did everything for eachother and loved being together. However he was always getting fired from jobs and I always had to try fix everything. 
On nights out he would get very drunk and I hated it because I was always so embarrassed. He also told a couple of guys to that he gives them permission to feel my boobs on nights out because he was proud of me and wanted to show me off.

Yes he had his faults and so do I but we loved each other so so much. We were high school sweethearts 

We then had our little boy. I had a horrific birth and ended up having PND. I didn’t bond with my son at all and I felt like my mom in law was trying to steal him away from me. 

My husband became the main person to look after our son because I just had no maternal love at all. I just felt like an outsider.

After a couple of years I decided to go train at a gym. One of the guys there started giving me so much attention and this was like a drug to me. I felt like I was the most incredible girl in the world and that this guy really fell for me. I became obsessed and constantly wanted the attention from him. This ended up where we would flirt on a few nights out. And then one day I slept with him 😖 at the time I was in such a bad place that I didn’t even care who knew. I was horrible.

Shortly afterthere were rumours going around about that night so I had to tell my husband about them but denied it for 2 years. He kept questioning me and eventually I told him everything. This absolutely DESTROYED him. 

He became depressed, suicidal and totally heartbroken. I vowed to make it up to him and spent the past 4 years doing everything I can to make it up. During this time my husband became so abusivr as he could not control his anger. I have been spat at. Held my my throat, kicked out into the street. And a few other incidents. Sometime I front of my son. 

I have been called every single name and after so many years of it it just wore away at my soul.
I have felt like the biggest scum bag for the longest time now and I’ve taken it because of my guilt.

He became obsessed with porn and recently I found out he had an emotional affair with a girl 3 years ago. This included sexual messages and sending naked photos. Nothing physical happened and he stopped it before it did.

I was absolutely devastated and not only because of him doing this but because I took all the abuse for what I did for so many years even though he knew what he did and because we were trying so hard to make this marriage work 

4 weeks ago we had an argument and he launched at me and dragged my head into a kitchen cupboard. It was the first time that I’ve ever been scared of him. Since that day I’ve become totally shut off to him (no intentionally)
I feel like that Intense love I had for him is just gone.

I know he is so incredibly sorry and I know I am too but I feel like I don’t love him anymore 

I want more than anything for us to fix this marriage and be the people God intended. I know we absolutely adore eachother and we have been through so much.

Do you thinks there’s any hope."
relationship_advice,Devastated.,I looked through my boyfriend’s iPad (32M) and saw he has had an account on a website to talk to men sexually and send sexually explicit photos back and forth for 5 years. We’ve been together since June. His most recent conversations are from the 24th of this month. I’m so confused. He messages them saying the craziest things and to asks to meet up. None of the conversations go past that. He swears he has never met up with anyone and has never been intimate with a man. He also says this is just a fetish of his and he considers it like watching porn...he doesn’t associate an actual person attached to these messages. I have no idea what to feel. I can’t talk to anyone about this.

After our first session of couple therapy (we are fighting a lot lately), we grabbed some dinner and she says to me that she was really stressed at work that day, and cries. After trying to calm her down and chatting about it, I bring to her attention that she has been really down at work (for uni) in the last 4, 5 months.

To be honest, it's wearing me down to see her like that nearly every single day she comes out of uni (and I'm not exaggerating). She complains a lot about one of her toxic coworkers, but says she can't do much. I enquire about her situation, and try to remind her that she can and should do something about this situation because it's been too long and I don't think it's healthy for her to continue like this.

Dinner is done. Prior to therapy, the plan was to sleep at hers. A few hours before it, she says she's really sick and that if she were me she'd reconsider sleeping together (because of coughing all night) and asks me if that's OK. I go, ""yeah, sure."" Now, out of the restaurant, she asks me to be with her that night, still teary-eyed.

She cries very easily, and very often, nearly daily. So I often don't know how to gauge the situation and know how badly she's upset, because she cries for very minor things sometimes (and that's OK, though sometimes a little hard to deal with). So, because she says she needs to go back to work and finish something, and because she called our night of I don't have my bag with me (not a huge deal, but hey), I ask her if we could postpone to tomorrow.

At this point, she hasn't asked about my day, how I am, what I thought of therapy, whereas I did; this isn't to grind gears, but it's something to keep in mind. So, me asking to postpone is my way of measuring the urgency of the situation beyond her tears and regular faff at work. She pulls of a half-assed ""yeah,"" looks at me crying as if to make me feel guilty, and goes off to work.

Three minutes later, she calls, crying, and asks me how the hell I could've left her in that state. That it is unacceptable. She argues that I should've read that that wasn't a true ""yes,"" and she was just not in the mindset to ""force me"" into going to hers. In her defence, sure, she did ask me. But I asked to clarify. And she's brutally honest with me, more often than not, so I expected an answer.

She nearly broke up with me and said that I cannot expect that much communication from her, whereas I think what can help us out of these situations is simply clear-cut communication. Am I wrong, am I expecting too much? Keeping in mind that she very often feels like this and almost makes me feel responsible for how she feels, should've I blindly just said ""yes, I'm coming""?

**TL;DR**: My GF is emotionally drained from uni work nearly every day, she asks me to come to hers and I ask her to postpone, she says it's OK, and minutes later gets mad at me for leaving her in this state. Am I expecting too much communication?"
relationship_advice,GF thinks I'm cheating on her because I go to the gym a lot and she thinks my muscles are smaller. WTF?,"I've been with my GF for 2 years. I'll start this off by saying that I've always been a very physically active person. Since the day I met my GF I've always tried to get some form of physical exercise 5-6x a week, whether it's sports or lifting. And she has always known that. 

Anyways, one of my goals this year is to gain some muscle and get into even better shape, and in the past few weeks I've been spending a lot of extra time at the gym. Yesterday out of nowhere she told me ""Are you sure you've been spending all that time at the gym? Your muscles got smaller."" I was pretty bewildered by that, and asked her to elaborate. She's like ""I just want to make sure you're not lying about going to the gym and seeing other girls, because if you spent that much time there you shouldn't be getting smaller, right?""

I basically just told her that's a weird ass thing to tell her boyfriend, that I haven't lied at all about going to the gym, and that she can either trust me 100% or not at all. 

Now I'm really weirded out by that conversation. My GF has been jealous/paranoid in the past, but this is a whole new level. What are your thoughts? Is this a massive red flag?"
relationship_advice,We need my brother to get a job,"Me(m18) and my mother really need my brother(transgender m20) to get a job or look for one or go back to school, we're very poor and my mother who is a single parent was getting money from the government for raising me but I've recently aged out, my brother has worked jobs before but has bad anxiety problems, he worked a job as a cleaner in a retirement home but quit because the vacuum was too hard to push, had a job in two kitchens but quit because he threw up from the stress of working in a kitchen and had a job at a dollar store but was fire because he took too many sick days, he has stopped looking for a job and has actually said that he sees no issue with freeloading off of our mother because my sweet mother doesn't have the heart to kick him out

Please someone help I really hope one day my mom doesn't have to make the choice of kicking out her own son I have no idea on how to encourage my brother I need help"
relationship_advice,Got a crush on someone that used to have a crush on me. Is it too late?,"When we started talking I was super busy and really didn't want to get into a relationship. I simply wouldn't have had time for it. Thus, a girl who had an obvious crush on me lost interest after a while since I didn't reciprocate anything. Instead we became friends that occasionally meet. 

But then, as my life started to settle down, we started hanging out a lot more and now I've gotten a crush on her. But she has started to call me her brother as well as date another guy. 

Is it too late to tell her?"
relationship_advice,Me (25M) and my girlfriend (21F) broke up and I need some insight.,"So we've been going out for two months and everything has been great. Like really good. I thought she was the sweetest girl and she was really into me. She was always down to go on little adventures with me and there wasn't ever a time I didn't have fun with her. Caught a lot of feels with this one.

The problem was the physical distance between  (45min-1hour). She (due to certain reasons) could not come down to visit me so our interactions were initially me going up to visit her which I did not mind at first. I would bring her down once in a while but that's a haul so I didn't do it often. This was made worse by our work schedules which cut our time down to maybe one or twice a week. When I finally asked for her to come down to visit, had promised she would, she said her family wouldn't let her go that far. Which I understand but honestly we're in separate stages of our lives when it comes to that. Talked on the phone or text every day but honestly there is only so much you can say before you need that face to face.

Now here is where it gets weird. Long story short I get symptoms and get tested on the side. Find out I got a STI. Confronted her about it before and after testing and she was insistent both times that she was faithful and that there was no one else. I had gotten tested a few month prior and it was negative. Now I'm inclined to believe her but the rational side of me is pointed the other way. I'm still confused about it now honestly. But this was the straw that broke the camels back with me so initiated a relationship talk. We agreed the distance was an issue. Voiced my trust concerns and she insisted she didn't know about the STI. So maybe had a partner long ago, maybe I already had it and was dormant, you can't ever be sure with this stuff. Told her she needs to get tested asap and get treatment. 

Broke up and we stayed on the phone for a long long time just not talking (which almost made me forget we broke up). I became an emotional mess for the afternoon. Couldn't get it out of my head. I was wondering if I was overreacting and in the heat of the moment made the call to break up. I wanted to make sure she was okay because if she truly didn't know this news is just as bad for her. So I bit the bullet on the same day and decided the best idea was to call her again with hopes we can salvage this. Told her I wanted to meet for dinner. She told me that she had plans with friends and didn't want to cancel. Taken off guard and honestly it just brought up the core of the issue again. So I just dropped it and hung up.

Do you guys think I made the right calls here? Should I even consider this relationship again or should I just move on and start fresh?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend is a cam girl...,"So my girlfriend 3 years (18F) has recently decided to become a cam model. At first I (19M) was supportive with the idea, it's fairly easy work and brings in good money. But it's been three weeks and I don't know how much more I can take. I can't talk to any of my friends about this because her career is a secret. So I'm turning to Reddit for anyone input because I can't keep my thoughts to myself anymore. 

She stays up all night online doing whatever the fuck guys pay her to do. I have to beg for sex, and even then she doesn't seem into it. But that's been a problem ever since she got on birth control... She never does chores, and eats microwave food and Postmates. 

I don't know where I'm going with any of this, but I'm crying at my desk at work and just want any input . How do I stay supportive of a career I despise? Is it okay for me to be jealous of the stuff she does for strangers on the internet? How do I tell her that the career she loves I can't stand her doing? What do I do?"
relationship_advice,Boyfriend doesn’t listen,"Whenever my bf and I have issues, I always have an in depth conversation with him about why I feel the way I do. I’m open and honest about all of my emotions and feelings with him. He says he understands and will try to not repeat those same things. 

Recently I’ve had a problem with him leaving me to go to the pub so often. I’ve asked him to give me time, and to spend time with me, before he starts going again. He hasn’t since went one week without mentioning maybe going and then is surprised that I’m upset when he brings it up? This has happened multiple times in just a couple weeks. How am I supposed to get over it if he keeps wanting to do the same thing every week, multiple times, after me asking him not to? 

I’m running out of options, I can’t keep having the same conversation with him. He never learns. I tell him exactly what I want and he can’t bring himself to do it for so much as one week. What do I do?"
relationship_advice,What should my friend do?,[removed]
relationship_advice,"To risk or not to risk, that is the question...","I met this girl about a week ago and we just clicked. She makes me happy and I make her happy. Both of us just got out of long, toxic relationships and are in position to jump into a new relationship. Both of us have a lot of healing to do ahead of us.

This girl was really there for me and responsive when we first started talking and then she started to disappear more and be less communicative. I was hurt, but it was what it was. She came forward eventually and apologized for her behaviour and explained herself. She wasn’t ready for a relationship and needed some space to process some stuff. I understood, but she asked me that I take a chance on her. She isn’t ready for a relationship right now and is a bad person for me, but with time she will get better and would potentially want a relationship. The big question though is: Am I able to wait for a potentially great person when all I know is the bad person?"
relationship_advice,Am I overreacting or am I being taken advantage of?,"So I live in Europe, family lives in America. I told my family well in advance I was coming to visit for Christmas. My brother has a new girlfriend and although he insists they just happened to meet after he just broke up with his ex of 7 years whom  he has a child with, I think he was having an affair. He got drunk with this girl and danced together on his birthday at a party while he was still with his ex. Within a week or two they started dating. So my image of this girl and their relationship was already bad. But I would give her a chance. 

So when I visited, I first met her at the christmas party. Her and my brother both didnt speak to me the entire time until my brother approached me asking about his ex. Once he was done asking what he wanted to know, he ""had to go"". 

Second time I saw him they took me out to dinner. My brother was super quiet and super on edge, totally unlike himself. He claims hes super happy with this girl and he wants to marry her (they've dated at this point for like 2 to 3 months), but I didnt see it at all. I told him a joke he normally would laugh at and he got really stiff and took it seriously. I was really confused by this behavior. Then at dinner he stayed on his phone not talking to me. It was awkward and speaking to his girlfriend, she mostly talked about alcohol and getting drunk at parties - great first impression. 

Last day I was there we went to an arcade because he still hadn't spoke much to me and I wanted to spend time with him. He knows I wont be able to visit again for 1 to 2 years. He is no where to be seen the entire time and hangs out alone with his new girlfriend. They take photos and post them on facebook with a caption as if they're on a date alone. No, you were supposed to be visiting your sister who wont be back for at least a year or two. He suddenly comes and says ""okay we need to leave now so hurry up"". That night his ex invites me to dinner and guess what? She doesnt mention my brother once, she asks about Europe and how I'm doing and the dinner was completely about spending time with me. It was really nice and it's sad that I had a better time with his ex who I was never close to than my own brother.

When I get back in Europe my brother calls me and starts interrogating me over the phone. What did you guys talk about at dinner? Did she talk about me? What did she say? I told him she didnt say anything about him. He continued grilling me with questions. I had it. Everytime I spoke to him it was only to get info from me otherwise I hear nothing from him so i said I love you but I feel really used and like you didnt care to see me at all. Everything was about your ex or your current girlfriend and I feel like you dont care to have a relationship with me. He claimed that's not true and accused me of not having the capacity to change my mind. Guess what? I havent heard from him since. I feel used and at this point I feel done with our relationship or lack of. I'm tired of people only contacting me if they need something and never being there for me, even if it's just spending time with me once a year. 

One thing I learned recently that upset me too was that my niece who I'm VERY close to is having a hard time with my brother abandoning them suddenly and her mom recently ran over a man accidentally and my niece is blaming herself. My brother didn't care to contact me, who has a counseling degree and is very close to her, and instead tries to get her to meet his new girlfriend (who also has a counseling degree), the reason for his abandonment and someone she doesnt even know. I only knew about this because of my parents. Am I overreacting or do I have a right to be upset? What should I do?

TLDR; Brother ignores me who he knows he can only see once a year or two for his girlfriend. Brother only speaks to me if it's about his ex and starts interrogating me about his ex. I had enough and confronted him saying it hurts me. He says I'm wrong and insults me, and once again doesnt contact me at all unless he needs something. I'm tired of feeling used."
relationship_advice,My(18m) girlfriend(18f) is terrified of my parents,We have been together for 2 months and I have been at her place a couple of times. During this time I learned that she is absolutely terrified of meeting parents(not specifically mine but ion general) My parents rarely go out and this Saturday they were supposed to but their trip was postponed. I told her to come over anyway and that she will have to meet them some time in the future and promised her that they wouldn’t even look at her direction and we will stay in my room and won’t  even interact with them. I know I can just wait these 3 weeks I just really prepared and hyped her up for the entire week and it was all ruined. What do I do to make her less hysterical of my parents?
relationship_advice,Serious relation advise needed,"So I have been dating this really cute but awkward girl , she always used to hand around with the  boys .(kind of Tom boy type) so I kind of got close to her . It was really difficult as she was really hard to get but then somehow I did manage to win her heart but nearly a year later 
She invited me to her house ,she dropped me a bomb shell that she was a trans gender. I just didn’t know what to do and I just said I need some time and just left . Now I just don’t know what to do . I didn’t knew that she was a trans .
I just don’t know if I should continue this relationship or not and also now I start to question my identity now. I just don’t know what to do ."
relationship_advice,Attachment issues and jealousy,"I’m in my first proper relationship for just over a year now and I haven’t really been jealous at all until recently. 

I have been quite clingy in the sense of spending  98% of  my free time with my bf since I don’t have that many friends and hate being alone. Also I spend time with him to avoid dealing with my issues and so on. 

I have been giving him more space recently which I really struggle with as it makes me feel sad and a bit unloved ( which I know is silly). Anyway we were out with his friend and they were all drunk talking about a girl they know that has become a stripper and checking out her Instagram. I think she’s quite cute and goth which I know my bf likes. Now I can’t stop obsessing over it. I have felt like I am  less attractive to him and so on since. I have always had issues with my mind frame while being intimate but it’s just worse now. 


I don’t know how to deal with this. 
Also a member of his family recently died so it has added to him just wanting to be alone, which I understand and I have given him the space he needs. I know this all sounds selfish Rn I just need an outlet and some advice."
relationship_advice,Bf stalking a girl 3x a month on Facebook,"I saw my boyfriend had his fb up and he’s friends with this girl. Not sure their story as I’ve never heard of her or seen him messaging her. I actually think it was his ex’s friend! So I am assuming out of respect to her and me he stopped chatting to her/the friendship. 

Anyways I just had a nosey at his history browser and noticed he’s been looking her up on fb 3 times this month... he is fb friends with her. I just find it weird as I’ve NEVER heard of her? And he searched her profile when I’ve either been asleep or he’s been out of the house... just confused as to why he’s even looking her up. 

Should I be worried? I mean I know I often search guys on mine even exes just to nosey and see what they’re up to, but not 3x a month... 

We’ve been dating a year now."

But she wants to study and get an internship abroad after I move to her.

I just find it really unfair. Am I wasting my time ??? Thoughts? Advice? ://"
relationship_advice,"My boyfriend watches trans porn and I have a hard time dealing with it, and I feel awful about it.","I feel awful about having a hard time with it because Im truly all for all sexualities and genders. Im bi myself. My problem is that I have ocd tendencies, and one thing Ive always had obsessive thoughts about in all my relationships are that my partner is secretly gay and cheating behind my back - and will eventually leave me because Im the wrong gender. I know this must sounds crazy, and I also know instrusive obsessive thoughts are not rational. 

I ALSO know that trans women are women(!!) and that it doesnt mean his gay. 

But even though I know that my obsessive thoughts are only getting more and more instrusive. I saw his search history and that he search for ""shemale"" porn daily (at the same time Im also offended he uses the word shemale because its an offensive term, which just makes this more strange I know) and he looks up the pornstars on instagram. 

I havent been able to talk to him about it. He seems embarassed which he shouldnt. Ive told him about my unrational fear, and that Ive had it always (I begun with me thinking my dad was gay and pretending to be straight in his marriages to women). It did not help either that after me boyfriend broke up with me (we since got back together) he wrote me that his close male friend had told him he was in love with him. I cant stop thinking theyve done things and lied about it.

My boyfriend says he is straight, but that doesnt help me. 

Im not really sure how to deal with it. I feel like an asshole because I cant just let it go, and Im afraid that whatever I'll say is going to make him feel like Im shaming. 

Ive usually been able to deal with these thoughts in past relationship but these things have made them go crazy. 

How can I approch this? Is it possible he is lying to me?"
relationship_advice,I ended it,A couple of weeks now that I broke up with my ex when do you think it’s a good time to exchange each other’s stuff back?
relationship_advice,I(20M) almost slept with a good friend's gf (20 F),"First of all, i'm a non-native speaker so i apologize in advance for my English. So my friend recently got a new girlfriend, after a very long period of depression over a short relationship with a girl (total bitch) . Naturally I was very happy for him because from what he was telling me his girlfriend seemed really nice  and I hoped he would be able to feel better again thanks to her. So a few weeks ago he threw a party at his in which i finally got to meet her. The party went well and I bonded with his girlfriend a bit and she was indeed really sweet, I thought i had noticed a few weird looks coming from her but nothing alarming I thought. 

So in my defense I would like to say that I actually have very little experience with girls (kissless virgin ahaha) since I used to be quite self-conscious in high school and haven't really had the chance to meet anyone since then.

 Anyway after the party she added me on facebook and we talked for a bit, she lives in an appartment with a few of my other friends and so i would come over from time to time to play with them and talk to her as well. Well as time went on she became more and more flirtatious and tactile, but I honestly thought she was like that with everyone of her friends. 

One night, I once again came to my friends' appartment to play with them and she was already asleep, it was really late and I was too tired to go home  so my friends offered to let me sleep on the couch which i did. In the middle of the night, the girl wakes me up and says that since her boyfriend isn't home I could sleep in her bed instead of being uncomfortable on the couch, now I understand how I might come off as a complete retard here but I honestly thought that she was being friendly. So I went to sleep with her without thinking twice, then we started talking a lot about personal stuff and she quickly became quite handsy (rubbing my back and things like that), then again I am really inexperienced with women so my brain kinda shut off for a bit and I didn't react, then she started taking off her clothes and mine, I finally woke up from my stupor and finally told her i was uncomfortable with doing something like this, thankfully she didn't insist and we ended up simply sleeping through the night. 

However, I still feel I should talk to my friend about it and tell him that his girlfriend isn't faithful to him, but I am scared that he might end up even worse than last time and I certainly don't want him to do something stupid over it, if you have any advice it would be greatly appreciated 

TL;DR: I almost slept with my (emotionally fragile) friend's girlfriend and dont know if I should tell him or not"

relationship_advice,Murrda junnkiee proffessor,"This is rollercoaster ride... Last April, new professor came in school... He is born in 1994, and I am in 2001... Anyway right away we realized that he went in same class as my sister and I was basically his favourite student... So... About month ago we started to get even closer... We started of with darkest stories about our lifes... (Idk if that's important, but I was in addiction recovery before we got closer, and I'm also diagnosed with bpd... He said he was in mental institution as well when he was in highschool)... We talked about how we both used to do drugs, we both were agressive, generally we had same or similar issues.... I feel safe, free, comfortable with him... Today I announced that to my sister... And when he left my house, my mother told me that my sister found out that he killed somebody and got away with it (allegedly he moved same year to capital city with family).... 

I don't know how to find out is that true...?? 
What if it is true...??
Should I ask him...?"
relationship_advice,Why would he ask this,"Ok this is something really really small and kinda stupid lol, but I went on a night out last night with my friends and the guy I’m kinda seeing was texting me throughout the night but when I came home he asked did I get with/kiss any guys.. I said no and he asked whyyyy... does he just not care if I did or he’s trying to get me to say something he wants to hear??"
relationship_advice,Boyfriend (M-M) doesn't seem to remember nights out,"I've been dating this guy for about 2 months, and for both of us it is our first serious relationship. He has an unfortunate past in which he was sexually assaulted after being spiked at a club. We've had to deal a lot with trauma from this but I think it is progressively getting better. 

However, each time we go out drinking with friends, he seems to get blackout drunk - to the point of him crying and me having to take him home. I don't mind this really, I care about him and to be honest, he's had to do the same for me before. The problem is, however, that he never seems to remember it. This was only annoying until recently when I was getting intimate with him on a night out. It was only kissing and dancing (which he initiated), and I felt comfortable doing it because my expectation is that when he is too drunk, he gets emotional. However, the next day he seemed to have not even remembered kissing at all.

He didn't seemed bothered by it, and brushed off any questions I had about him being worried about it. I'm still really nervous about it though, because now I'm afraid that I will get drunk one night, and we will do something more serious together, and he won't remember it whilst I will. I feel like at that point it becomes very shady, right? 

The problem is that I can't tell him to stop drinking so much, because then I would become the controlling boyfriend who monitors his intake. I can't stop drinking with him, because then it would seem like I dislike spending nights with him. I can't simply not get drunk myself, because then he'd be wondering why I'm trying to stay sober whilst he gets drunk. And I can't simply reject his advances on nights out, because then he'd feel like I'm rejecting him. 

I really don't want him to one day think that I took advantage of him whilst he was drunk, and we've done stuff together before where I've drank and he's been sober - but he made sure to give me water and asked repeatedly to make sure I was okay with it at the time."
relationship_advice,Girl wasting my time or?,"Girl wasting my time or?

Girl used to reply fast now only replies at night?

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn’t slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don’t understand if she’s losing interest shouldn’t she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I’m deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I’m going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I’m just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?

She’s already deleted her Tinder about a week ago after I said I’m deleting mine"

relationship_advice,Why is my niece(16F) behaving strangely?,"I am a 35-year-old woman and I require some advice regarding my niece's (16F) behavior. My niece (brother's daughter) lives in a relatively small town - the kind where almost everyone knows everyone else. Her parents and the people around her believe that she is the most beautiful girl in town and do their best to flatter her about her looks instead of encouraging her to do well in high school or in her tennis classes. Her mother believes she has the potential to be a tennis champion and an oscar-winning actress too (I'm not exaggerating). She paid me a visit during the Christmas vacation. Her mother (my sister in law) was with her as well.

Throughout the week, my sister in law narrated boring tales about how difficult life is for a mother of a beautiful girl. She has to be protected from the predators (boys) in school and suspicious relatives who might abuse her. I was so bored that I challenged my niece to a game of tennis instead. Her mother warned me that I was going to get wallopped. Surprisingly, my niece turned out to be quite an average badminton player and received a thrashing instead of giving me one. She failed to win a single game despite the fact that I am beyond my peak fitness levels. She shook my hands at the net and puckered her lips to give me a kiss on the cheek when her mother arrived. 

I was stunned to notice that she withdrew her hand immediately from mine and ran to her mother. Her mother was furious to know that she had lost and might have even hit her had I not intervened. The girl kept telling her mother that she had sprained her foot in the first game, although I am certain that nothing of that sort happened. She spent the entire day locked up in her room. When she ran into me in the dining space, she said ""sorry"" and went back to her room again. I have no idea what is wrong with her. Is it not my duty to ensure her well-being? Why did she not admit defeat when she lost fair and square?"
relationship_advice,My gf [24F] isn’t communicating with me much anymore and I [24M] don’t know how to get her to open up to me,"My gf and I have been long distance for 2.5 years dating for 3. I haven’t seen her in almost 2 months because I went out of the country and then came down with pharmaceutical drug withdrawal (another story) which has caused me to be almost bed ridden. I need to get better before i can visit her which might take me another few weeks to a month. 

We communicate mostly over text and she’s usually very communicative and uses terms of endearment a lot and always asks about me and my day, etc. I’ve called her occasionally and she is the same way, telling me stories about her day and so on 

But over the last few weeks (probably second week of January to now) she’s becoming increasingly more distant and our conversation has become incredibly dry and impersonal. I feel like I’m texting my boss instead of my gf. She’s sending me one to two lines of text isn’t elaborating much and has stopped inquiring about how I’m doing or how my condition is getting along. 

Frankly it has me kind of worried. I’ve kind of asked her if everything is ok and she just says “yeah” and doesn’t give me much to work with. Last night I asked her how her night was going and she stopped responding, yet she was on social media the whole
Time. I feel like I’m annoying her each time I reach out which makes me feel even worse.

I asked her today if I can call her in the evening and talk about how she’s doing, to which she agreed. I plan to ask her if everything is alright and if she’s feeling something, to just let me know so we can work through it. I’m frustrated because I feel like I have nothing to work with, and I’m concerned she won’t give me any feedback when we speak later today. 

Any advice on what to do? How can I get to open up to me? I just want to understand how she feels and see if I can fix anything on my side to make her happier."
relationship_advice,Is my teacher sexist?,"So, I'm the only guy in my class, rest are all girls

Yesterday in class we were doing our work and a few of us were talking, while doing our work, then the teacher said ""name, stop talking, do your work"" fine, everyone else was talking but fine, I stopped. 

Then a few of the girls were talking again, but this time they were whispering and she said ""lads, ye don't need to whisper"" so they started talking again

Then I started talking again and the teacher said ""name, stop talking, get your work done, you have a lot to do"". Only thing is, I had everything I was meant to do done. 

Girls started talking again, fine, then I started helping one of the girls beside me with my work and when I did she was like ""shh, stop"". 

Today isn't the first time she's done that. She seems to do it in every class I'm with her and from what i've heard from other classes, she seems to give guys a harder time."
relationship_advice,My girlfriend lives in a bubble and it’s driving me insane. (More to the story👇🏼),"Me (18F) and my girlfriend (18F) are almost a year together. We’re in out last year of school before college, and lately she’s been driving me crazy with her assumptions of how everything’s going to be great if she doesn’t work for it. 

The big exams that determine if you get into college are in June, and since October 2019 she’s been avoiding going into school, and saying she’s ‘studying’ at home. What about all of the new content she doesn’t understand and simply cannot just learn off?

However, there is a reason behind why she doesn’t go in. She’s suffered from severe bullying in the past and had to transfer schools only about two years ago, and every morning she wakes up she dreads going to school, so completely avoids it altogether. Although I will never understand how she feels because of this traumatic experience, she still cannot not attend school, a good education is needed to help your future. 

She thinks that even if she doesn’t attend school, and just sits around at home doing nothing that she’ll still get into college. She also thinks that she can afford to move out of her mothers house straight after she’s done school, my 23 full-time working brother can barely afford it, how is she going to afford it? 

I don’t work like this, and it’s quite challenging to not argue with her over it like we have countless times. I don’t work like that, I take it all with a pinch of salt and I know it takes hard work and there’s responsibilities to undertake, but it just seems that she’s ignoring them all, and living in her head. I love her with everything I have, but it makes me want to scream at her to wake her up and say “hey that’s not how the world works! Wake up!” 

She’s convinced she knows what she’s doing and won’t listen to anything anyone will tell her. Maybe she does know, but it just drives me crazy being with someone who has no ambition to make their life as best they can. 

Does anyone have advice on how I can just stop letting it bother me? I care for her future but I simply can’t keep arguing with her about it anymore, I need to stop."
relationship_advice,(20 M) Should I text (20 F) her again or wait ?,"My friend moved abruptly but before she left we said we would try an ldr. She said she would text me when landed and she texted all the way till until her wifi cut off on the plane. She landed two days ago. I've sent 2 good mornings and one can we talk no response. The messages said read. I know how insecure this sound but this just feels weird and extremely out of character. We both were kinda clingy together when she was here. It was unnormal get bunch of texts.

Concerns:
Her phone is broken kinda bad she cant call or text unless with certain wifi apps we use line and discord

She need to change her numbers when she lands

Shes in a foreign country 

She normally gets back latest under 24 hours

She did say she wouldnt be able to call until a week after she got settled 

Thinking about waiting a few days text again bc there is a good chance she might be unable to contact me.

I think I'm worrying for nothing"
relationship_advice,Girl I have a crush on is dating my friend and her best friend told me she liked me,Ok so ima try and make this short but basically I’ve known this girl for like 5 days and we’ve been talking and playing games n shit and we finally meetup today and you know I was awkward at first but I think everything was fine in the end. Anyway ever since we left she hasn’t really responded to any messages on our group chat or liked any of my jokes which she usually does and now I’m just really confused and idk what to do.
relationship_advice,Im content with the fact ill never find love.,"22m virgin, never had a gf, never kissed anyone, im very active, been told im attractive (to the point where I should model actually) but I just feel like I don't connect with anyone enough to start a relationship. Whenever I get to know a girl they always end up falling in love with someone else, even when we have everything in common, never argue, and are just all around really close its never mutual. So im guessing I'm just no ones type? Idk, it does hurt seeing everyone else in relationships and i hate always third wheeling but whatever, I get the pleasure of not having to spend money on someone else and thats something right?"
relationship_advice,"My SO starts burping as soon as I start talking or need something. He says he can’t help it, but I’m getting very annoyed.","My SO can talk for 45 minutes straight without any symptoms. He is one of those that likes to talk through his thoughts when he needs to figure something out. I’m mostly quiet, but there are times I need to tell him stuff - funny stories, plans for later, etc. Every time I start to say something he gets this sick look in his face and starts burping over and over again. When I ask him to take care of himself and we’ll talk later, he gets really mad at me and calls me immature. It’s wearing on me because I don’t feel heard, he doesn’t remember me asking him to do things, and I feel bad for talking. Can someone help me decipher what do to or what’s going on?"
relationship_advice,Back again same sort of issue,"My long distance girlfriend and has said to me I cannot give her what's she wants/ needs? 
Althought I show her support and affection I'm always there for her I plan out visits by myself and obvs we have sex when I visit she knows how I feel about her and how much I care about her and that I'm trying to work on progressing our relationship such as work stuff to hopefully to close the distance in the near future . But shes still stuck on having sex without protection. It just makes me seem like she forgets everything else I do for her and that's the only thing she wants me for. I dont know how to handle this situation as she wont talk about it as theres 1.nothing I can do to fix it.
2. Shes tired of talking about it(she wont come to a compromise either)
3. She said its somthing I have to sort out by myself 
So basically I have to fix our relationship problem on my own and I dont know how to. 
I'm getting tired of the same situation again and again as it's like treading on egg shells when ever it comes up as I really dont know what to say"
relationship_advice,I don’t know what to do...,"This is a long story but I’ll make it short.

I really liked a girl...So I told her how I feel. She told me she doesn’t know how She feels about me. At that time we were in an army course together. But now we are stationed far from each other but in actuality we live 30 mins away from one another. She told me that we will talk about it at the end of the course

I waited till the end. But again she told me that she doesn’t know how she feels. She specified that she’s going through a difficult time family and life wise. She also mentioned that she feels something towards me but she doesn’t know what it is. On top of that she told me that If it wasn’t for the time period the answer wouldn’t be no.

She told me she wants to stay good friends for the time being...I respected that, but I also mentioned how difficult it is for me to be good friends since I really like her. 

After a day I told her that I have to take some time for myself. Time off of her I guess. To get over her. But she told me that she values me so much and that she doesn’t want me to leave because it will ruin my chance of us being together. So I stayed.

Since then we’ve talked a lot. Every night we talk on the phone for hours and eventually fall asleep together.

But I can’t keep going like this... I completely understand that right now isn’t a good time for a relationship, for the both of us. But I just want to know if she likes me to... she I talked to her? Will it scare her away? I’ve already opened up so much to her. I just don’t know what to do"
relationship_advice,Have you been in a relationship where you've been gaslighted?,"I'm asking an open ended question, but i do think my friend is"
relationship_advice,Is this a long shot?,"So, I started college in August last year and made friends with this guy. On the first day of classes, I was sitting outside the class because I came super early and he and two other girls showed up and we all chatted and introduced ourselves. 
I only ended up having this one class with him and I rarely saw him outside of it.
Anyway, we were both art majors and at our school we all are required to attend a convocation where everyone kinda mingles in one of the school galleries and I saw him there and ended up hanging out with him most of the time because I was really shy and didn’t know anyone else. I remember I kept apologizing cause I felt like I was being annoying but he reassured me and we had a nice conversation about music and stuff. 

So, here’s where my question comes in. I didn’t think to ask for his number or anything because I figured I’d see him in class the next week. 

What ended up happening is that I had an emotional breakdown because of things in my personal life + being overwhelmed by a full-time schedule and I ended up withdrawing from all of my classes. 

I spent most of the following months mostly with family and I was certain I’d never step foot on that campus again but I couldn’t help but be really sad that I had made this friend who I really liked and there was probably no way I would ever see him again. BUT...

I had met a girl at the same convocation he and I hung out at, and actually thought to get her number. I recently reconnected with her and I even asked her to say hi to him for me. (They have a class together, but she said that he sits in front and leaves before her usually..)

I really want to be this dude’s friend but I don’t want to be a creeper haha. I like to hang around the art department anyway, but is it weird of me to ask my other friend to get his number for me or something? 

I’m a firm believer in going after something that means something to you, and I feel like In my heart I’m supposed to have this person in my life. I don’t know. Maybe I’m being silly. 

TLDR; met this guy in college, made friends, dropped out of college and I’m wondering how I can find him and talk to him again without being a creeper. Might be worth mentioning I’m a girl"
relationship_advice,to move on completely or just pretend nothing happened?,"I(M18) hv been talking w this girl(F18) from my class since we were 14 15 and graduated frm the same high school a few months ago. We hv continued to talk to each other DAILY since we were 14 15, even the days we didnt she would send memes on IG. I knew she liked me then ('16 '17) but i semi rejected her because i really wanted her to do well for her studies so we could both go to the same high school, keep in mind i still liked her.(At that point in time i thought i did the right thing) Even after she got semi rejected, our rs/fs didnt change at all and we continued talking. We probably continue to hang out like 2 times a week on average for the past few years, watch movies, go out etc. A few months ago after our highschool graduation i ""asked her out"" and she said she only treated me as a friend. I stopped initiating convo w her but she still occasionally sends me memes on IG. Highkey its been really tough for me trying to move on. These few weeks shes been posting on her IG story w a new guy and tbh it makes me really jealous. I completely understand why she would ""treat me as a friend"" and i only hv myself to blame for my predictament. I really dont blame her, but i just want to know if i should stop talking to her completely stop asking for hangouts or continue to keep in touch only when she initiates.

Tldr: guy and girl are best friends. girl rejects guy when he ""ask her out"", should guy continue to keep in touch after girl ""has a new guy"".

relationship_advice,My (23F) girlfriend got drunk and made out with another guy while we were on a break. I (23M) am having a hard time coping,"So this break started 2 weeks ago, the main reason was that she has depression and was having a hard time with having a relationship, she didn't wanna go out and didn't like physical contact so to stop hurting me she proposed a break which I agreed to

About one week later she went to this party and one of my friends told her that I told him that I was single a couple of days earlier then when we had a break, she said this broke her, she started crying at the party. The story my friend told her is completely untrue I would never do that

She then said she got really mad and started drinking a lot at the party she told me she made out with one guy, that she was so drunk she doesn't remember, she said someone told her afterwards, she says she does not know the guy and no one told her who he was which I have a hard time believing 

I really really like this girl but I feel shes not being honest with this whole thing and not telling me the truth, I am  also really hurt because she was with someone else obviously, it technically was not cheating but it just feels so wrong to her ask for a break and get drunk and make out with another person,

I already confronted her and asked her for the truth but she keeps telling me she does not know who it was which I think shes just saying to keep me from getting even more hurt, I'm really considering dumping her but I feel at a crossroads because I really really like her"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend has an extremely stressful and abusive home life and I want so badly to help but I don’t know what to do.,"My girlfriend and I are both 16 and in high school. We have been best friends for over a year and have been dating for over 4 months and I know I’m young, but I can safely say this is literally the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. We have never gotten into any major arguments because we could literally talk anything out because we’ve both had some shitty pasts.

Every night she’s been coming home and oftentimes would call me breaking down and just be absolutely bawling her eyes out because of her home life. Her brother is 19 and mentally abusive and leaves the house an absolute wreck every time she comes home and her mother screams at her if the house isn’t clean by the time she gets home from work. She’s constantly left piled with a shit ton of work that has to be done and she’s so stressed out from all the verbal abuse from her family and just constant over-working that she’s considered suicide as a way out. Her brother’s an adult but her mother would never kick him out of the house even though he’s a huge lazy POS because she’s not like that. Her parents are divorced but her father is just as bad, if not worse, and literally lives right down the street so she wouldn’t have any reason to move in with him. Her family moved here from New York to get away from her abusive step-dad (who still has legal custody over her) and there’s a chance she might get evicted because of rent and just how badly of a condition her brother leaves the house and have to move back to New York. She wants to move in with her grandmother very badly but she doesn’t have any custody over her and her mother would most definitely refuse to let her go over there. If she doesn’t get out of this situation soon and get out of her house I’m scared she’s just gonna absolutely break down and things might escalate to things even worse. I’m trying so very hard to help her out and think of ways to get her out of the house but since we’re young we don’t have many options. Could anyone please help?"
relationship_advice,How do I deal with the guilt of enjoying my own company?,"TL;DR - Love my girlfriend, but look forward to 'me' time a lot. 

I (22/m) have been with my girlfriend (22) for about 4 years now. We met during the first year of college, and will graduate this year.
Before this, neither of us had any experience dating. The first few months (even a year) flew in a happy trance - we lost our virginity to each other, spent every living moment together and enjoyed this newfound feeling for each other. To this day, I love her very much and still am very much attracted to her.
However, our relationship turned into looking after one another. We don't go out much, but make it a point to spend precious moments together. We live in separate places (few kilometers apart). She respects my space a lot, and understands that I love spending time with myself. It's not becoming a problem but to say the least - I find a lot of joy in writing music, playing video games and reading books. The moment she falls asleep or isn't around, I RUSH to my favorite game/book. Sex went from being a 'want' to becoming a 'need'. We both are happy if it happens once or twice a week.
This is a tiny part of the story.
The other part is where I find guilt in enjoying the company of other women and flirting around. I absolutely HATE the fact that I find myself being attracted to every other women now and then, only to withhold from making advances because I don't want to hurt my precious girlfriend. As much as I love her, the 'young' me wants to explore.

In conclusion - I see a big chunk of my life with her - living peacefully in a happy relationship. But the other part of me which wants to be by myself ends up in guilt which I don't like. Not sure what to do here."
relationship_advice,My GF found old nudes on my phone,"I’ve been dating my GF for about 2 years now, our relationship has been dealing with some ups and downs but nothing that we couldn’t work through. A couple nights ago she went through my phone when I was sleeping and apparently really did some digging and found a folder in my email where I kept my nudes I got from other girls throughout the years. In all honestly, I completely forgot they were there. Haven’t looked at them or seen them awhile before I started dating her. Obviously In her defense, she doesn’t believe that and I probably wouldn’t either. She’s really upset about this one and won’t even talk to me. I’ve been giving her space and told her when she’s ready to talk about things I’m here. Just kinda curious if this would be a deal breaker for a lot of women out there? I really do love this girl and have never cheated or done anything that would put our relationship in jeopardy. I’m upset that she thinks I’m this scum bag cheater now. How do I explain this without seeming like a liar?"
relationship_advice,Sexless.,My man moved in 3 years ago( I'm 55 he's 45). All sex stopped and slept on the couch. In three years I had sex maybe 5 times plus he was drunk every other day so I has sex with someone else on occasion. A guy he knew. Nothing but sex ( hook up basically). Was I completely wrong? I love my man very much but... He now knows I cheated and is devastated.
relationship_advice,"(25m) confused about mixed feelings from (26f), how to proceed?","I have been seeing a girl for about a month. We’ve gone on about 6 official dates and she stayed with me for about 10 other separate occasions. Here is why I’m confused...her and I are looking for the same thing. We share the same views, same career goals (we even work in the same profession), same family dynamic and goals with family too, we both have been through emotional trauma (infidelity), so we both share similar beliefs on it and can easily empathize with one another, we have similar interests in music, food, the chemistry is unprecedented, the sex is surreal and the sexual chemistry is unprecedented, the conversations are interesting and exciting, I mean, this whole thing is a different dynamic for me. It’s been awesome and I can’t complain. However, she tells me that she wants to “take things slow,” and doesn’t want to be official. Let me preface before anyone tells me I’m rushing it, I haven’t even brought it up. It was discussed at the beginning of our “relationship” and she has brought it up a couple of times since. Although, she blames focusing on school and “fearing that people are going to judge her for moving on so quickly,” which I can understand. Except she agrees with everything I said above and she makes comments about it all the time. She tells me long term she’s looking for something serious, just not right now. I like this girl. There is a ton of potential here, but am I wasting my time? This girl would be worth waiting on, believe me, but if she’s just using me essentially, I don’t even want to bother. I don’t want to pressure her by bringing it up, but I know if I bring it up it will feel like pressure, so I don’t want to ruin my chances. 

I’ve pretty much cut off communication with every other girl I was contemplating going on dates with. I have no idea where she is at with that, but if I had to guess, I probably wouldn’t like the answer. Again, we’re not exclusive, but how long is an acceptable time for that talk? 


Thanks everyone!"
relationship_advice,Why would my (21f) ex (21m) text just to make small talk?,"My ex broke up with me a over a year ago and shortly after the breakup we went full no contact. 

We go to school together but dont have to same classes so we dont cross paths. A couple months ago he was seriously injured. I felt bad as it was his second major injury in 2 years (the first injury led to a bout of depression and eventually the end of our relationship). I decided to shoot him a quick text saying ""hey I heard about your injury, sorry that happened, hope you're doing okay"". He replied right away with ""thanks [my name]"".

I figured that was the end of it and we were back to no contact. Then a couple days ago I accidentally made eye contact with him in the hallway and he texted me. Just making small talk ""how are you? What's you been up to?"" That kind of stuff. I responded with polite but brief responses and it was a pretty short convo. 

Why would he do this? I see no reason why he would want to make idle chit chat with me. I'm not sure but I think he has a new girlfriend so hes definitely not trying to get back together."
relationship_advice,"Someone, please talk some sense into me (28/f)","First time posting, English is not my first language so apologies for any grammar errors. Also, sorry for the long post. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend spent the night at another woman's house that he met at a bar. He says nothing physical happened and that he was very drunk and just passed out. He is VERY apologetic and is begging me not to leave. Not sure whether I need to end it or try to work through it

My partner (32/M) and I (28/F) have been together for 2 years and have been living together for the majority of the time. I’ve been financially supporting him for the last year and a half while he’s been acquiring skills for the business we recently started together. 

Last night my partner and I went out for drinks. It was the first time I met his best friend and his fiancé. Everything was fine, although I felt a bit left out but I wasn’t too bothered and just kept myself busy while they caught up. 

However, as the night progressed I noticed my bf acting more and more annoyed with me. Anything I said or did was met with contempt from his side. He would rudely argue with me about totally trivial things, passionately express how hot he thinks other women are, made a random remark to his friend about how difficult I can be, and made no effort to include me in any conversation he was having with his friends. 

I just started keeping my distance from him and didn’t engage much. I thought he’s probably just drunk and maybe this is how he likes to act around his friends? I just tried to brush it off and keep the night chilled. On our way home he said something extremely hurtful and unnecessary to me, by this point I’ve had enough so I lashed back and said something rude too. 

He turned around and started walking away. I kept going on route home and soon found myself alone in a quiet road in the middle of the night. We live in an extremely dangerous country, so this is not a good situation to be in. I tried phoning him a few times but he didn’t answer. I was getting scared so I got an Uber to take me home, hoping I would meet him there. 

He never came home that night. I was hysterical with worry and was frantically phoning him a million times. He never answered my phone calls. I had no idea what to do. I assumed he phoned his friends we were with to come to fetch him, so I tried tracking them down on Facebook to ask if he’s there but I couldn’t find them. I spent the whole night crying and worrying that something had happened. 

The only thing that kept me sane was that his phone was on, in our country if you’re a victim of crime that won’t be the case. I didn’t hear from him until the next morning, he just sent a message saying that he’s safe and he just woke up. 

He arrived home a while later. Turns out he went back to a bar, picked up some random woman there, and went home with her. He SWEARS nothing physical happened. Apparently they just chatted and then he passed out. He says he was extremely drunk and left her place in the morning when he woke up 

I couldn’t believe it. My heart just shattered when he told me. About a year ago there was another incident where he acted really inappropriately with his ex-partners, and we’ve been working extremely hard to get over it. It’s been really hard for me but he swore up and down that it would never happen again and he begged me to give him another chance and that he’s a “changed man” now and that part of him “died”. 

An important thing to mention is that we’ve been living in a small town since we started dating, we don’t have many friends around. So we’re very close and basically all we have is each other. I never in a million years thought he would do something like this to me. 

I feel so confused and betrayed. This was my partner, my best friend, we had our whole future planned out. All the decisions and sacrifices I’ve made over the last year were for our future together. I don’t know what to do now, how do I walk away and start over with nothing? I don’t really have anyone to talk to or any friends close by. 

He’s been extremely apologetic and regretful. He made an appointment with a therapist and swears he will stop drinking. Will I be a fool to stay or am I just being dramatic and this isn’t really such a big deal? I just need some perspective or advice, I feel totally lost and alone at the moment."
relationship_advice,Upset or just don’t bother?,"Hey guys so I (m24) have been with my gf (f23) for about 9-10months and she always tells me that she’ll text me when she gets home from anywhere with her friends but she never does. If Ik her well Ik when she gets home she just washes her face and goes straight to bed lol. Idk if I’m just being dumb and just let it go but she always does this and I never know when she gets home. I mean we have been together for almost a year but it’s still a lil bothersome she doesn’t let me know she’s home, what do you guys think? I think I’m just upset at the fact that she tells me something but never does it"
relationship_advice,Me (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) ran out of interesting stuff to talk about,"A little backstory, Me and my GF are childhood friends. We were playmates and good friends up until highschool. After HS graduation we lost contact with each other. Fast forward 5-6 years we met each other again and we hit it off and started dating. She was my first girlfriend so i am unsure how relationship works.

We used to never run out of stuff to talk about. We haven't had the chance to talk in 5-6 years after all. But now that we are done catching up our online chats has been...stale? I can't think of anything to talk about other than some small talk (like how are you, how was your day, what did you eat) which is completely fine with me. But is that enough? I am afraid that we are starting to drift apart.

We still enjoy each other's company when we go on our dates. I only have problem when talking to her online.

So my question is: Is this fine? What do people in relationships chat to each other about online? Am i overthinking this?"
relationship_advice,I’m worried about my ex,"Me (19f) and my ex boyfriend (19m) broke up a few weeks ago. Long story short he went to jail and I had a miscarriage. 
He went to jail for 40 days and we didn’t speak while he was in because he only wanted to speak to his mother. When he got out we talked and he told me he wasn’t in the right frame of mind for a relationship right now.  Which I can understand, I think going to jail and losing your baby all at once can really take a toll on you. I was disappointed though but have given him his space.  
But I’m worried about him, when we last spoke he was just so defeated. Now I don’t know if I should reach out and see if he’s ok, or just let him be. I just think he’s in a really dark place right now and want to offer him support but I also don’t want to overstep any boundaries."
relationship_advice,A guy needing help understanding if I am doing something wrong? Have I crossed a line? How should I proceed?,"My name is Scott, I am in my early 30s and this post revolves around a group of friends that for a number of years I hadn't spoken with very often as I moved away from my home town to the shiny lights of the Big City in my early 20s.

Specifically this revolves around a couple called Dean and Claire, Natasha (Dean' sister) and Louise. Dean, Claire and Natasha I have know most of my life and my relationship with Dean has always been brotherly despite the fact we aren't actually related.

In the middle of last year, I bumped in to Natasha and Claire out of the blue when I was back visiting the family; we had a bit of a catch up and we arranged to meet up.

When we got together a few of the other old faces were also around and I was introduced to a few new faces too... Dean and Claire had a son, Natasha had a daughter and a few new friends that had been added to the group in my absent years... one of them being Louise.

Before long I was seeing everyone a little more regularly as I had moved back closer to home, and I got to know some of the new faces.

I have always known, since we were about 15 years old, Natasha had always had a soft spot for me and whilst we were always close prior to me moving away and are close again now I am back on the scene... I have only ever seen her as a sister, in the same way I have always seen her brother Dean as a brother. 

Since being back on the scene, I have said in conversations with everyone that Dean and Natasha are like the brother and sister I don't actually have and Natasha has referred to herself in conversations with people (while I've been present) that I am like another brother. 

It is relevant to the story that I say, when I have gone to social events I have tended to stay at Natasha' house... I have tended to sleep on her sofa, but there have been half a dozen or so times I have actually slept in her bed (when other people have stayed and the sofa was needed for other people), but nothing has ever happened... we've not slept together, we've not fooled around, we've not kissed.

Anyway, in early November, purely out of respect, I asked Natasha how she'd feel about me asking Louise out for a drink (we are both single, we had got to know each other a little over the previous few months and I was interested to get to know her a little better) and it didn't exactly get a positive response. In fact, far from it... I was apparently out of order for even thinking about it. Something Dean and Claire also mentioned a few dozen times in subsequent conversations.

Anyway, one of the other group members had a birthday celebration, and it was a little awkward between Natasha, Dean, Claire and myself... and a couple of other people noticed... and asked me if I was alright because I didn't seem myself... one of those people was Louise and I won't deny it... I was honest with all of them... I told them I had effectively asked Natasha' permission to ask Louise out for a drink. None of them thought I was out of order, in fact they actually said it was the respectful thing to do, because had Natasha not known about it and then suddenly Louise and I started dating, that could have caused a bigger problem.

One of the people I told was Louise herself, because she had asked if I was ok and that conversation led to a very interesting conversation. Louise had said to me on the telephone that had I asked her out for a drink, she probably would have said no anyway because she couldn't trust me... which I found a little odd. I asked her why and she told me that the first time we ever met, I left earlier than most as I was heading back in to the city and she was having a conversation with Natasha about me. She said to Natasha that I seemed nice and Natasha had immediately responded with ""he is, but you can't trust him, he has been unfaithful in every relationship he has ever had""... which simply isn't the case... the conversation went on and little by little it became apparent that over the last 7-8 months  since being back on the scene, both Louise and I had been told some rather unsavoury things about the other, that simply weren't true... and I think it became apparent that certain people within the group had set about ensuring Louise and I never looked at each other in that way. All a bit childish really.

Anyway, when confronted about it, those people denied it, but the evidence was there and they simply buried their heads in the sand and stuck to their story tat we were both making it up and nothing bad had ever been said about the other.

Now, Louise was really upset that her friends had said the things they had about her, and we actually met up over a coffee one Sunday morning to discuss it and before you know it, we'd spent the day together, had lunch, dinner and it was almost 9pm. We then both went home to our respective houses and that was that. Over the next few days, we chatted via message and we arranged to meet up again.

Since the beginning of November we have seen each other at least once a week (sometimes three or four times in a week) for a drink, a bite to eat, to watch a movie etc. 

I really like Louise and I know she likes me too but she is holding back because of how the others would react if they found out. We have had discussions about it, neither of us classes ourselves as being in a relationship, but at the same time, neither of us classes ourselves as being available. I am currently taking each week as it comes.

Are we actually doing anything wrong? Am I wrong for wanting her? Is she wrong for wanting me? Do I need to give her time to come to terms with it, or is there anything I can do to help her decide if this is what she wants? I am being the best possible me, but at the same time I am trying my utmost to be respectful of how she feels about everything. What should I be doing?"
relationship_advice,"How do I ask a close family member, who suffers from cold sores, not to kiss my baby without being rude?","I’ve gone my whole life without getting cold sores by being careful and never sharing drinks with people. 

A lot of people in my life suffer from cold sores unfortunately, especially a very close family member.

I don’t want them or anybody else for that matter to kiss my baby on the face or on their hands, since babies are always putting their hands in their mouths. 

I want to protect my baby and ask them in a way that doesn’t burn any bridges. I’m really not sure how to ask them this sensitive question without hurting their feelings. 

My family member is very sensitive emotionally and I don’t want to hurt them. However, my number one priority is to protect my baby.

Any ideas?"

relationship_advice,My (30F) Boyfriend (30M) has started a weird masturbation ritual at work and I don't know if I should be disturbed and would like advice.," 

We have been together for 5 years. We both teach physical fitness for a living, but different types. 

He has just admitted to me that when he has his evening classes, which is 3 nights in a row each week, that he does something I would like advice on. He said he will go in, watch porn on his phone in a back room and be horny but not masturbate, go out and teach his classes, then after his students leave he goes and masturbates in that same back room. 

He teaches small class sizes (4-9 students usually) and most of his students are female. His students are mostly committed regulars who love him. There is the same group of women that come 3-4 days a week to his classes. This group of ladies were actually my friends I met from my work from before I met my boyfriend, with other women that I don't know as well.

It is creeping me out because I feel like he has created this weird sexual ritual that involves his students without them knowing. Why go in early to watch porn but not masturbate? Why make himself be yearning, essentially, to masturbate while he is teaching? I'm worried he is using them for stimulation. It doesn't help that again, majority of students are female, wearing yoga pants and sports bras with no top and the like, and getting sweaty with him. 

The most disturbing aspect to me is that 2 nights a week there is a 14 year old girl that comes to take a couple classes in a row. He has admitted to doing it nights she has come to classes. He used to coach cheerleading and now I have started to wonder about that a little honestly and I don't know if I am over reacting.

He says it has nothing to do with the girls in his class, and I could believe that, but he lies. Like, a lot. Our relationship is imploding right now because of a slew of lies and betrayals I have found out about. We are trying to make it work but it has been rough and there has been a lot of sadness and mourning the relationship I thought I had. He admitted he thinks he is addicted to porn as well. I had wondered that already because of how much he watches it, talks about it, and masturbates. 

Frequently he gets up at 1-2AM to look at porn and masturbate, then most mornings he is in the shower for 20 minutes to masturbate before work. So why is he still having to go into work, look at porn, make himself hold out for hours, then masturbate again?

I would love some different male perspectives on this especially. Is this considered normal? Should I be worried? Never heard from any of my friends before that they masturbate at work. I also feel like I would be disturbed to know if my teacher frequently masturbated after I left, but that's me.

TL;DR Boyfriend has started weird masturbation ritual at work and I don't know if I should be disturbed because of his female students. "

relationship_advice,How to make friends in this online chat when I can’t seem to join into the conversation?,"Hi!

I recently joined a discord for an interest of mine that’s rather niche - there are only ~50 in the discord and there aren’t any other online communities or forums for this interest. I want to make friends in this discord so I have people to talk about this specific interest of mine.

But... Everyone seems to already know everyone there. I try to join conversations but always either get ignored or get a short yes/no/lol reply.

I’m not sure how to get more involved... I feel like a “third wheel” even though it’s a chat with many people in it... 

I really want to make friends with at least some people though, I’m not looking for super close friendships even, just, friends enough that I can message them to chat about cool stuff related to our shared interest.

Any and all advice is appreciated!"
relationship_advice,I don't know what to do,"We went to a student party last night together with my girlfriend and few friends. This was an out of town event with only a few familiar people there. My girlfriend is extremely outgoing and social so being her she went and started talkin to lot of different people. I spent most of the night catching up with an old friend. An hour or so go by until my girlfriend comes and tells me that we are extending the trip by one more day. I had said I wanted to leave on Saturday and expressed my opinion again. I gave up fairly quickly though as I wanted my girlfriend to stay happy. Lately she has said that I make every situarion out to be a negative one and nothing is ever fun for me which I admit I often point out the negatives. This made me want to keep the mood positive which is why I gave up pretty quickly. 

Evening moves foward and me and my girlfriend are playing beerpong with our friends. I'm not the worst or the best but this time I got a few shots in and didn't miss much. Girlfriend gives me a kiss and says it's nice to see me play well sometimes. We ended up losing though. During rematch I don't remember anymore why but for some reason she started joking about how I'm bad at the game. This upset me and she quickly pulled back to say she was only joking. I comment that she has been belittling me the whole day since even during the car ride to the event she made some comments about how I'm not a good driver or how I don't handle alcohol well. Me being a bad cook is also a common thing to mention. She got quite irritated by my comment and started demanding examples of what she had said. I let it be and didn't continue and she stopped after a minute too.

It's starting to get late and people are starting to leave. My girlfriend has found a new female friend whom she clicks well with. Before me realising this she comes and asks me if she can sleep at the party place and says ""it's onlt with girls"". We often argue about the fact that in her opinion it's fine to sleep in the same bed with other men and she doesn't understand why it's fine then if she sleeps with other women. I got upset by this we had left for this event together and the plan was to sleep at our friend's house. I started to get annoyed so I said in a serious tone to ""Stop"". She quit after that.

Half an hour goes by and my girlfriend comes to tell me that she booked a holiday trip with this new female friend. Destination being a place we were planning to go together. Our plans of going haven't moved foward because she got anxious about booking the trip and wanted me to do it and I haven't gotten around to it.

At this point I was hurt and disappointed. Not the first time I have had to listen these kind of surprises so I told her that we were leaving now and that otherwise it would be over. We are starting to plan on leaving with my friend while my girlfriend is fooling around. While talking in a group the new female friend starts to roll a joint and before my girlfriend can finish her question I pull her pretty forcibly to the side. This was my mistake that I acknowledge. 

People pull us apart and I wanted to get out of there so I left. After a while I came back and we left with my friend and girlfriend.  When we got to his house I took my stuff and said I will leave. They followed me for about 2 miles trying to get me to turn around. Friend listened to us argue about all kinds of things and later offered his comfort and said that in his opinion of what he had heard that he was on my side. My girlfriend had veen shouting about how she doesn't underatand what she had done wrong which soon started to be that she hadn't done anything wrong. She also said how us being together for half a year wasn't a relationship, how it's easy for her to move on from me, how she knows that I really actually wanted to stay there, how I will never find anyone better and how I am the same as her exes.

I got tot he station but got a cab back to friend's place after back and foward mesaaging with both of them and my girlfriend finally breaking down to cry and tell me to go back. Till this point she had been angry the whole time. She alsp muttered an apology accompanied with how she had done nothing wrong and that she won't go on the trip.

I'm back at friend's place and it's quiet between us and I am leaving soon. I feel like I should cut this relationship but at the same time I don't wanna lose her. I know her good qualities and love her for those. Still last night ended on the note that it was ending. I don't know how to mpve foward from this. Please give me advice.

Also to note that she uses medication that doesn't mix well with alcohol. She said she won't drink much but a wine bottle and 4+ beers later..."
relationship_advice,I [F22] want to ask my boyfriend [M23] to marry me,"Our relationship started out really slow compared to most relationships in our age group. We were friends for six or so months, then we were dating without doing anything physical. And it was amazing. We bonded so closely, we often say that we feel at one with each other. 

After that things moved quickly. We moved in together after only dating six months. It’s been absolutely amazing. It’s my second time living with an SO, and it is so much better and healthier this time. We don’t fight. We don’t get angry. If there is a problem we talk about it, but to be honest I can’t even recall a problem we’ve had. The biggest issues come from me having C-PTSD which makes it difficult for me to react correctly, sometimes I shut down instead of being clear. But he understands and he gives me time and he works with me. 

Anyways, we’ve been dating for a little over a year, but we’ve been basically seeing each other for a year and a half (since we both had huge crushes while we were friends). We’ve never talked about early marriage, which seems so weird. We often talk about deep or abstract ideas, so honestly it feels weird not knowing what he thinks of the idea. 

For me, I never thought I’d be the person to want this, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s weird because I don’t really care about marriage in the sense of there’s a big wedding or it’s a huge occasion, and I never understand why it mattered. If you are living together, it’s basically the same thing. But that’s all changed. I just want to marry him. He’s my one

We already talk about the future as if we will be together. We’ve talked about where we would live, how schooling would work for him, etc 

So my question is how do I find out if he is comfortable? I don’t want to ask him if he isn’t, but I feel like bringing up the topic is basically the same as asking. I know communication is needed, I’m just having issues finding a way to say it.

Thanks in advance!"
relationship_advice,I dont know how to approach bf about my depression.,"Ive been suffering from depression for 15 years. I dont take meds, no need to. I try to stay positive, workout, take walks, distract myself. I know Ill never get “cured” from it so Ive learned to live with it. I tried suicide four times in the past. Two of them ended being hospitalized. I still have suicidal thoughts but I keep them controlled and convince myself that its not worth it, I still got much to live for. My bf is a great emotional support for me but he doesnt understand depression. He has never suffered it and thinks that Its my choice to be depressed because I dont want to be happy. Therefore its my fault. I really want to fix it but I struggle a lot on my own. Sometimes I just stay hours in bed staring at the wall doing nothing. He would complain about it but Im just so tired. I cant sleep at nights, no appetite, I even go days without smiling or looking at his face. I also cry a lot(alone so I dont bother him). I know he is no professional and I understand it can be a bit annoying, dealing with my depressive bullshit 24/7. But sometimes I cant control it so I just hide myself. I think things would be easier if he understood how I feel instead of just telling me that its my fault I dont want to be happy. I proposed going to therapy to deal with it somehow and he said that was stupid, they just want my money. And again mentioned that its my fault and I should learn to deal with it. He speaks from ignorance, but he doesnt mean wrong. He wants me to be happy but doesnt understand why Im not. One of his parents suffers from severe depression as well, he is medicated but the meds have kind of left him a bit on the “weird” side of sanity(not sure how to explain this) . He tries to encourage me a lot but I feel if he knew a bit more about my problem he would succeed more. Like for example: he thinks if I play more games on my free time I will be happier. I do love gaming but that kind of distraction only works minutes before I start feeling bad and turning it off. He would buy me games I never asked for (he doesnt play them if theyre for me) and encourage me to play. I dont want to. Ive mentioned some distractions that could help me(all of them outside our home) but he never takes me anywhere... he either forgets or cant/doesnt know. I told him he should try and take things a bit serious since it does affect me psychologically. Right now Ive been on my pajamas for a month, sleepless, not eating or talking. I feel as if Im getting into the bad side of my depression and having a hard time getting out of it. I asked him for help but he didnt know what to say and made fun of me for my daily habits(I went grocery shopping and he mentioned “hey look! Sunlight! Do you remember it?” And laughed it off). I know I can do this on my own but having a partner to help me get up again would make things so much easier. How do I make him understand this? 


Sorry for the long story. 

TL;DR: my bf doesnt understand my depression and I would like for him to do so He can help me get better."
relationship_advice,I (F22) am questioning my relationship with my boyfriend (M28) due to different needs in life,"Hi, all. Hope you could give me some advice with this. 

First of all we've been together for nearly five years and we're pretty complicated. I love him but I wouldn't say he's my best friend. I love how dedicated, responsible and caring he is. He is basically the perfect partner any woman would love to marry. He's stable at the moment and looking forward to having a family. We've been together through many rough times, supporting each other. Due to circumstances, he is currently waiting for me to come back to him in our country when I graduate this year from university, and thus saving funds. He's planning to rent a good place and buy a good car. 

However in my area of expertise I don't have many options. I'm a creative and I can hardly find nice opportunities in our country. There's more options abroad, better pay on all levels. I have to communicate to him that this might be a deal breaker for us, and it's scheduled to be in April when I fly back. I love him with all my heart but I'm afraid I'm making a mistake settling down instead of at least giving a chance to my career options here. No matter how much I'd like to go back to my country, I feel like it's sacrificing myself for him.

To be honest, we've grown so into each other, that I can't imagine what I'd even choose if he wasn't in the picture. Maybe I would stay here although it's a miserable existence being alone abroad. Overall I don't feel like belonging anywhere in the world and I don't have enough funds to support myself. I live paycheck to paycheck as a poor student.

He wouldn't like to come abroad with me for the third time, he's had enough of this country. And he's finally being stable with his job. He's offering me a placement through connections he has, related to my career, but how sure is it? I just don't want to sacrifice my chance for getting decent money by going to a dying city.

Every day he texts me how he's anticipating my graduating, even makes me graduate earlier; he tells me how he has nothing to do when he comes home from work due to me being absent. I feel so, so suffocated this way. First, because it overlaps with my studies. Second, because it feels like he has no life outside me. But that's possibly due to his age and wanting to start a domestic life.

When I went to university, he told me he hopes I don't lead him on for three years only to dump him at the end. But it's not my decision only... I love him very much, it's just I'm not sure what to do with my life, and I'm very afraid that I will make my life miserable voluntarily if we break up. At the same time, I know, that whatever happens, happens for a reason and I'll get over it somehow. Any advice, please? :("
relationship_advice,I (19F) hate my boyfriends (20M) beard.,We’ve been dating for 3 years and he’s been clean shaven since we’ve met and I’ve always expressed how much I love his clean shaven face because of how well it suits him. He recently did no shave November just because why not and he asked me multiple times how I felt about his beard and I said I wasn’t a fan of it. He liked it a lot so he decided to grow it out again for the new year. This time it’s even messier than before and it gives me a rash when he kisses me and when I tell him to stop he gets grumpy and still refuses to shave when it puts a damper on things. I feel bad asking him to accommodate to my wants because in the end it’s his body and I don’t have the right to tell him to shave it but I don’t know how I should cope with my dislike for it. Any ideas as to what I should do?

Should I attempt to make conversation with her?,"A while back I met a girl via her sister who I am somewhat cool with. Not to long ago, I decided to follow her on Instagram with the hope of getting to know her. I also liked one of her older photos. Originally for some reason, I didn't expect her to follow back. However to my surprise, she not only followed me back but also liked an older photo of mine.  Would it be wise for me to assume that she is at most interested in conversing with me via Instagram or am i just overthinking? What should i do?

additional details:  The girl and her sister also both know my mother and follow her Instagram as well. so I dont know if she is just being nice or if she followed back and liked my photo out of genuine interest."
relationship_advice,I (26 M)feel like my feelings are going to jeopardize my friendship with my best friend (25 F),"I've known my best friend for about 6 months and in that time we've gone from being acquaintances to friends to best friends. We've told each other things that no one else knows about and overall just have a great connection.

The problem is that I have strong romantic feelings for her, and while she has also said she has feelings for me she's currently in a struggling marriage. I'm trying to be the good friend and support her in getting it fixed but it's becoming quite difficult. 

We have sexted and other similar things while drunk but that was quickly put to an end, we knew it was wrong. 

I just don't know if I should tough it out, remain friends and try my best to help her save her marriage or distance myself to try and save myself from becoming even more of a wreck. 

I try not to let my feelings get in the way of my advice but it's getting harder, I just want her to be happy whether or not that involves being in a relationship with me.

I should also mention there's a distance gap, I'm in Germany and she's in the Netherlands..

relationship_advice,What do i (M22) do if my girlfriend (F20) finds me ugly.,"We’ve been dating for 2 years and the relationship is going great. We communicate, we do little things for each other and i love her. She’s a solid 10 and i’m maybe a 5.5 if you’re being generous. I get self conscious about it sometimes and i often wonder why she’s with new and she says it’s because i’m a great guy and stuff. Issue is, every once in a while when i send her selfies she’s like “oh i feel bad for our kids” or “what if our kids turn out ugly”. It fucks me up sometimes and i’ve asked her about it and she keeps saying that she finds me very attractive but it still fucks me up sometimes."

No reason to believe she blocked me other than the fact she has a boyfriend now."
relationship_advice,Does he (16M) like me (16F)?,"He’s recently broken up with a toxic ex but they’re still friends and she seems flirty around him. 

We go to different schools and haven’t officially met in person yet, unless you count waving at a bus lmao

Signs he might like me:
• he checks up on me
• he asks if I’m okay/how my day’s going
• he said I’m fun to talk to
• he’s starting sending kisses after his messages after I hinted that I’m looking for a valentine

Possible barriers:
• his ex still being around
• the fact that we don’t see each other in person, however meeting up is an option since he’s only like 20 mins away

I’d list everything I like about him but I’m so infatuated honestly 🥺 this boy sings, plays piano and guitar, is kind and soso pretty,,, yeah I’m in deep hehe

TL;DR: met this boy like a week ago and already head over heels for him, is it possible he could feel the same already?"
relationship_advice,I (M 24) need help getting a girlfriend and need advice.,"I’ve reached the point in my life where I need to settle down and get a girlfriend and then hopefully married! However I have never dated before or been in a relationship.

I’m looking for a specific kind of a girl to date but I’m not sure how much or how little I should determine the importance of those things. I have been told to never settle but I feel like the “ideal” woman would be one in a billion and then there is the possibility that she doesn’t even like me lol.

Then there is the fact I suck at picking up signals from women. There was a girl in my class last quarter that I had a major crush on and I just realized a few days ago that she left me an opportunity to get to know her better but I completely blew it. I always can never tell if a girl is just being nice to me or is actually in to me. So I thought maybe online dating would be an avenue to try because there is no beating around the bush about intentions but I hate setting up profiles. I’m a very anti-picture person in the fact that I hate photos of myself. I don’t think I’m ugly but I literally have 0 photos of myself and I never take pictures. Plus, I never know what to say. 

I know I’m ready for a relationship and I want to settle down but trying to balance what I want in a woman, picking up on interest from women, and putting myself out there in the dating world has become very overwhelming. I keep hoping that a beautiful woman comes and knocks on my door one day and makes me her boyfriend but that most likely won’t happen lol. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
relationship_advice,"I dont think i want to be in a relashionship anymore, and i need advice","Hello everyone, this is gonna be a long post(and sorry for my grammar, i'm not great with english.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have a good relashionship, but after have depression, i think i dont want to be in a relashionsip anymore, but i dont think it's fair to hurt her like that, and to throw a long relashionship like that on the garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my(M23) gf(F22) for almost 7 years now, we started dating when i was almost 17, and it was most of my side leaving things behind along this relashionship, because i care so much about her, that i kinda put herself ahead of me, dont say stuff that i want to say because she won't like it, and stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

A brief resume about my relashionship focusing on my side of things, and the things that hurted me along all these time. I found out that she hook up with another guy before we started our relashionship, but we already been seeing each other for 4 months and she said she realy like me, and one time a girl that she worked with said to her that she saw me and one female friend talking on the street, and that was a reason to her to discuss with me, and this is on like, second month seeing each other. I found out because of a school friend, and confronted her, she said it was only one time, and ""we at the time doesn't had nothing serious"". Ok, i let it go, she is kinda right.

&amp;#x200B;

Our relashionship had many red flags for me. After one or two months one day she pick up my phone, go to facebook and deleted a lot of my friends, which was girs, i only had 2 male friends in my life, but i was realy friends with some girls, and not the type ""oh we are friends, but if you want something, i want something"", it was a real real friendship. But okay, i cant be friends with girls, my gf doenst like it, okay, i have to give in to have a good relashionship, right? So i kinda lose contact with all my friends because of that, i dont blame her, she asked, i did it, i could say no, but i didnt, it's not her fault.

&amp;#x200B;

I always regret a litte bit to started dating, i never was the cool dude, who goes a lot of parties, but letting my friends go like that kinda hurt, but i love my gf, so it was good to make her happy, and my relashionship it's based more on her, on my side of things. I always found myself doing the things she liked, go to the places she liked(but not exclusively), because i like to see her happy, and it was like this for all those years.

&amp;#x200B;

We had our discussions, but i always found a way to stop her sadness, always supressing something or two that i liked to say because i want to see her happy. And all those litte discussions about small things created at lot of those moments, and i bottle it up those feelings, kept it for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on more recent stuff, about one year ago we started talking about moving in togheher, and i was looking foward to it, but we are poor, so to start a life together i said i want to have some money first, for precaution, in case something goes wrong, and for buying all the stuff we need in the house, so we agree to start saving money, and when we have enought, we move in together.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently i discover that i have depression, and it's been a litte bit hard dealing with those feelings, i called in sick half a month, one month i only worked like 5 days, because it was hard leaving the bed, but she is been very supportive, only with little discussions about our future.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the part were i need the help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda thinking about that a lot, and the more the time passes, more i think i dont want to be in a relashionship anymore, but i dont think is fair to hurt her like that, because i know she realy love me, and i realy care about her, but the more i think, i want to be alone, to always do the things i want, to not have that responsability, to be me, but i dont know that is fair to throw a almost 7 year relashionship because i dont want to be in a relashionship anymore, to just do what i want.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you help me with that?"
relationship_advice,Maybe a weird question,Is it bad I love styling and playing with my gf’s hair. Brushing it is like my favorite thing in the morning.
relationship_advice,Best friend (27/f) of ten years didn’t wish me (27/f) happy birthday,"My best friend has never missed one of my birthdays. She usually gets me excited about it and asks what I want to do. This year is different. I know she has a lot going on in her life. She’s an accountant and it’s busy season, plus one of her grandparents recently passed away. 


I don’t want to just be like: hey ya dick! You forgot my birthday! Because I’m thinking she may be overwhelmed right now and I don’t want to cause her any stress. Knowing her, she’d feel guilty for forgetting. I almost feel like mentioning the birthday thing at this point may be selfish since she’s dealing with her own stuff. 


To be honest, it does kind of make me sad that she forgot. We don’t see each other often anymore because we live in different cities, but we are close. Should I just not mention it? I wanted to give her a call this weekend to just check in with her and see if she’s okay. What do you guys think?"
relationship_advice,Why doesn’t she seem very excited to go out with me?,"Normally I’d see this as a rejection. But it doesn’t seem to be in this case 

We’ve been seeing eachother for about a month now. We text every day. We have sex. We’re intimate. Go on dinner dates etc. 

But whenever I ask her on a date she’s like ‘oh I’ll have to let you know I’m very busy’. I know she has exams but so do I. Whenever she’s with me she seems to really enjoy it. 

I asked her the other day if she wanted to go to dinner and she did the whole ‘I’ll let you know thing’. So I backed off. Told her it was a shame she was so busy and to let me know if she’s ever free again. She then came back saying she was really sorry and she’s just really busy and tried to organise a coffee date. I asked her if she actually wanted to do this and she said ‘I’d love to’. Then it was back to the same old bullshit. 

I can’t call her out on anything, even playfully, as she gets snappy and angry at me. 

I don’t know what to do? She seems completely uninterested but interested at the same time. She always expects me to stay the night and cuddle / have sex. 

What do I do/ think?"
relationship_advice,My (22M) girlfriend (21F) and I have had a drop in our sex life,"We’ve been dating for 3 years and early on we had sex a lot. We had a period of long distance where we were seeing each other every couple of months, but we were taking/facetiming/texting everyday. When we would see each other we would have sex. She moved in with me almost 2 years ago and since it hasn’t been the same. It will be months between when we have sex. I do try and she’ll say something to the effect of “we will tomorrow.” I know she doesn’t owe me anything I’m just looking for how others of you have dealt with a situation like this. Thank you in advance."
relationship_advice,"My bf (30/m) thinks I (25/f) am cheating on him cause I said ""what's the plan, Stan?""","Dating 3 months.


I went to pick up an item from an aquaintance who lives kind of far away. My bf wasn't happy about that because he doesn't really like it when I hang out with guys I know from before I met him which I do understand. However, he was in that aquaintance's city a week earlier and I asked him to pick up the item for me and he didn't feel like it, so I had to make the 4 hour commute eventually.


After I got the item I headed straight back home. I texted him, ""What's the plan, Stan?"" because I wanted to know if we were gonna hang at home or go to his brother's or something else. He just texted back, ""who the fuck is Stan?"". English isn't his first language so I thought it was kinda funny that he didn't get it and I texted back, ""Plan, Stan - it rhymes."" I didn't get a reply during the entire 4 hr trip back home.


When I got home he was pissed off, immediately asked me whether the name of aquaintance is Stan. I laughed and said no, and that in fact I didn't even know anyone named Stan. I explained the ""pun"" again, and told him it was something my dad used to say (which is true) and tbat it was from a song or something. He calmed down and got back to normal.


Then this morning he woke me up pissed again. He'd gone through my FB and found out that I did have someone named Stanley on there. I remembered then that I went to college with a Stanley but we called him Lee and it's been a few years so it didn't cross my mind when I told him I didn't know any Stans.


He left and has been gone for hours now. I'm in his apartment and I can't leave cause he left his keys here. Is it just me or is this weird behavior? He hasn't been this para before. How do I reassure him? 



TL;DR; my bf thinks I'm cheating on him with Stan from the song lyric ""what's the plan, Stan?"" and won't believe me. What can I do?"
relationship_advice,"I (25m) am trying express to gf (24f) the boundaries I'd like for her to set with guy friends, is this reasonable?","We've had frequent issues with her and guy friends. Guys professing love to her, feeling it's ok to talk to her sexually, etc. I feel like it comes from her not setting strong boundaries, and not proactively discouraging interest from guys. I am planning on saying something like this to her:

I don't mind if you carry on friendships with guys, but I'd like for you to proactively make them feel as if you're not interested in them. You should find ways to kill any possibility of them thinking that they have a chance, such as occasionally/causally mentioning your BF (ex: oh yeah my bf loves that show too). You should assume that if you haven't purposely tried to express disinterest, that they may think they have a chance.  You should assume if you haven't told them you have a bf, that they don't know you have a bf

You should put extra thought into things that could be misread as possibly being interested, such as exchanging pics of yourself with guys privately, or using excessive heart, and winky face emojis. You should also actively discourage a ""guy friend"" focusing on your physical attractiveness (comments about you being beautiful, sexy, pretty, etc).

If you are finding yourself frequently having intimate conversations with a guy for hours, it'd be nice if you mentioned that to me as well. 

Tl:dr: is this reasonable to say to her, any thoughts about this?"
relationship_advice,My (31/M) wife (30/F) wants to separate after one year of marriage.,"So the headline pretty much states the situation I'm in. 

After a year of marriage, my wife wants to separate. We have been having issues in our relationships that have not been addressed in a real way and her answer is to separate. Being transparent, her issues from me is that I have been pretty loudly angry in private and public and I own that, it's wrong.   


After some reflection, however, it dawned on me that my anger is a response to the fact that she has not respected my wishes or the relationship in a real way. I said this to her and she has admitted as much. However, instead of working on the relationship together, she wants to separate to work on the issue. To me, this isn't how a relationship, much less a marriage, works. If an issue arises, we're supposed to work on it, not hit pause on the relationship. I have suggested couple's therapy and her response is that we can do it while we live apart. 

As stated previously, she has admitted that I have been the one keeping the relationship alive and that she hasn't really put in her part. She sees separation as a good thing. That it will help us. I don't.  Am I being too shortsighted?"
relationship_advice,Family reunion at birthday party with dad to which I didn't spoke for long time,"Hi there. English is not my first language and I'm on the phone so sorry for mistakes. 

A little background. My parents are divorced for many years now. They both have started a new families and have other kids. My dad lives in another state so I don't see him much and I live with my mom. About year and a half ago I got kicked out of the uni (long story short - I decided my mental health is more important than uni at that time) and my dad took it, well, hard. He called my mom and yelled at her that I have to go back to school etc. He also said something along the lines of ""OP and her sister are practically strangers to me, so this is your fault and you should deal with it.."". He moved to another country, had very less interest in our lifes and when I got kicked out of uni me and my sis were staying with him for 2 months because he was getting merried again and had a little son. I was there at his couch for 2 whole months and yes, he was at work lots of times and me and sis too (we got summer jobs while staying there) but he could ask me anything. I tried so many times to make small talk or talk with him but it was like talking to myself many times. When I was trying to talk about my life and he only had assumptions he made about me thru his life decisions in my age. He had pretty bad picture about me  and he didn't make the effort to get to know me or my sis at all. And then he dared to say that his own child who idolized him for years and loved him even when knew some pretty interesting things about him (which were not good at all).. I never told my sister what he said. But it broke me at the moment. When he called a few days later I didn't pick up. I couldn't. I needed more time to proces. He called again. And I again didn't pick up. It was still too soon (it was about week after he yelled at my mom). And after that he stopped calling. So he and I are in no contact for approximately 18 months. My sister talks to him regularly and I know they talked abou me too. But since she doesn't know what he said, she doesn't know why I didn't pick up phone back then. Lotnof family members from his side knows we don't speak. But no one wants to get in the middle of it so no one is really trying to make this right.

To the point - my grandma (my dad's mom) has big birthday party tomorrow and the whole family is going to be there including my dad and his wife and kids. I somehow don't know what to do or how to talk to him when I will see him. I'm so scared I will ruin party if he tries to talk to me because I'm still hurt and angry. My mom told me a few days ago that he laughed when she told him I'm going to work and that uni is out of picture for a while. That made my blood boil. I really don't know how will I react tomorrow. I also considered not going there so I couldn't ruin it. But granny is so excited because after long time she will have so many family members at one place (she couldn't be at the wedding because she can't travel for that many hours). I can't let her down like that.. 
What should I do? Thanks ❤️"
relationship_advice,Boyfriend gets randomly moody every time I’m with him?,"My bf and I have been together 2 years, this has been a thing pretty much our entire relationship. He told me before that he had anger issues and it kind of stemmed from playing xbox a lot when he was younger.

I find when I’m with him, I could be having all the fun in the world but if he gets in a bad mood or is not having a good day (usually most of the time I’m having a blast) then he just shuts down and won’t really talk to me, will snap if I try to help, yells and is just angry.

He’s not specifically mad at me, but if ruins my day and I’m starting to get fed up. It’s every time I’m with him he gets like this at least once and it usually passes quick but it makes me feel like shit.

For example, almost everytime we go snowboarding together something goes wrong and he gets in a bad mood, if I try to comfort him or help he yells that he’s fine, he won’t talk, gets mad if he has a bad run, and it’s taking a toll on me.

I’m a comforting person, so a lot of the time he’ll get even more angry but I’ve stopped trying lately and just get him to laugh a bit and his mood fixes itself. He always apologizes to me after his fit and explains he’s just not having a good day or he doesn’t even know WHY he’s angry and will hug me tight, I always tell him it’s okay but it’s made me not want to see him. He even yelled once and for some reason it made me cry (wasn’t even that bad of a yell, guess I was sensitive that day) and he immediately started apologizing and hugging me saying he shouldn’t snap at me.

How can I help him next time or just avoid this all together? He’s a drag sometimes but I love him and want to be there for him."
relationship_advice,Should I confess to my crush?,"I have a crush who’s in one of my classes (only 6 people in the class and it lasts all year). We talk, but not a lot, it’s mostly just group conversations and asking about work for the class or band. I don’t want to make things awkward for the rest of the year since I have a class and band with him but I also don’t want to regret not telling him at all. So what should I do? I really do like him but I’ve never really had a crush like this so I don’t know what I should do."
relationship_advice,Feeling insecure after bf finding bfs porn.,"I've (f28) been with my partner (m30) for almost 1 year. Our sex life is pretty good but I'm insecure of my body and usually have the lights off or leave my top on. I'm about 20lb overweight and very insecure about my breasts as they are slightly different in shape and size. 

Used bfs laptop for some work and hed left the porn up. I know he occasionally watches it and I have no issues with that. I know its probably unusual but I've actually never seen porn before so being curious I watched it. 

The women's bodies are perfect. I cant believe how perfect they are. No my insecurities have risen and I dont know why hed ever want sex with me comparing my body to theirs.

relationship_advice,My relationship is about to end. Advice needed.,"How do I accept that this relationship is going to end soon?

I’ve been with him for 1,5 years now but I don’t see a future with him to be honest. We live in different countries and even he told me I should find someone near me, someone who makes me really happy.

Things haven’t been going really well lately and it started affecting my mental health. He makes me cry and I can’t tell him. He also makes me so furious at myself sometimes and this is just telling me that I need to stop it in order to become happy and my best self again. 

I just can’t yet. I don’t want to hurt him and thinking about it hurts me as well. Sometimes I wish I never met him."
relationship_advice,Boyfriend doing drugs?,"I’m mainly writing this because it helps me piece my thoughts together, but advice would be appreciated.

My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) got together only recently (18th of jan) and all is going well. But the thing is, he’s quite notorious for being a huge drug user and a bit of a dealer. This is the complete opposite of me, I have never touched drugs (apart from alcohol) and generally am a very sensible, goody-two-shoes kinda person. 

One of the reasons he liked me so much (these are his words) is because of my sensibleness and he really thought that I’d be the answer to him sorting himself out and getting off the drugs/that whole sketchy world. Not so much that I’d help him, but he knew in his heart that I (being in such a good, normal non-drug addict girl that could have lot going for them) really didn’t deserve such a “wasteman”. Therefore being with me would motivate him to sort himself out. He’s been wanting to clear himself up for a while as he’s realised the come-downs aren’t worth the highs and there’s a man at our work who’s in his 40s and is a serious drug addict who’s always broke and has absolutely nothing going for him. He doesn’t want to end up like him. 

Since the 6th of Jan he hasn’t done any hard drugs. He smokes weed every 1 second at the moment, but apparently with the intention of stopping that too eventually but one step at a time. Beforehand he was stuck in a loop of doing coke at work to get him through the shift, Valium and Xanax when he got home to relax him and then repeat to get him through life. With various other things every now and then. 

Now I think where I’m muddled is I don’t know how I feel about everything. In no way what so ever have I encouraged him to stop doing drugs. I feel as though if I do participate in his detox, he will fear telling me if he ever did take something and would lie about it not wanting to disappoint me or for me to get mad? Therefore every single time he’s mentioned getting off drugs I just listen to him and don’t really comment. I guess I also don’t really care if he does break his no hard-drug streak? Or do I? I don’t know? A few days ago he went and did quarter of an acid tab (he said he might do it with a mate and they were gonna go somewhere pretty but never got round to it) and mooched around some lake all day on his own. He 100% did this because he was bored. My genuine reaction to this in my head was “oh that’s kinda weird that he’s doing it on his own but I can imagine it would be fun/something to do so fair enough, I wanna hear about what he see’s cos I’m very very interested.” He also told me it’s not really an addictive drug. This made me think it was literally just a very peculiar activity to keep him entertained for the day. The next day he then did a whole tab. Due to the sun being out (which it wasn’t the day before) it being another day of boredom. It didn’t really do much though according to him. This got to me a bit because at this point it was presenting itself as an addiction thing.

Today he’s told me that tonight he’s gonna go to a nearby town to chill with his mates. He hasn’t really been there since he started this whole ordeal and all of these people are fat drug addicts just like him. He’s also just been paid . I quote “going there is a risk cos I just got paid”. So basically tonight there is a big chance of him doing something. How do I feel about that idk? At least he’s having fun I guess. I just hope he doesn’t fall back into the loop.

To be honest I’ve never seen him in his drugged out state. Maybe this is why I don’t have an opinion yet because I haven’t witnessed it? At the end of the day yes I am ashamed to tell my family that he’s a big druggy boi. Although my fam isn’t really opposed to drugs. Yes i would like it if he was drug-free in the future because I would like to have a stable, nice household that’s incredibly safe with kiddies running about. And for it not to reek of weed. He also may die hella early which I’m not down for. Right now I think he should have fun cos life is too short. But the addiction loop does frighten me. I think I am scared of addiction, not the drugs.

What I wanna know is, how should I be with him? Should I continue how I am, not really commenting on what he does and doesn’t do? I guess I would say something if I knew what to say. Idk. I feel like my lack of encouragement and wanting him to stop is making him think it’s okay if he does drugs and therefore is gonna fall back into doing them. Idk help plz.

(Sorry for any big headedness about me being sensible I was just trying to get the point across)"
relationship_advice,Has she lost interest or busy? What do to fix?,"Girl used to reply fast now only replies at night?

Matched with a girl in tinder and been talking for a month. Was supposed to meet a few days ago but she cancelled t-2 days before due to some issues. She didnt offer to reschedule. She is aware that I will be deployed the day after our supposed date  (1 month long deployment). We continued to chat for about 6 days continuously with minimal pause in between. About a day ago, she stopped replying in the morning and only replies at night as fast as usual. what gives?

Her nighttime only replies simply just happened. She didn’t slow down her usual replies prior to this slow reply saga. I don’t understand if she’s losing interest shouldn’t she be lazy replying at first and starting to go slower and slower?

She knows I’m deploying the moment we matched cause I told her right then and there unless she recently changed her mind. I’m going to see how things go and just slightly pull back

People suggest she lost interest and I agree. I’m just wondering how she lost interest all of a sudden when I did not feel any difference in her earlier interest level through chat?"
relationship_advice,Why is my ex acting so arrogant (and sometimes not)?,"3 years together, half of the time in the same apartment. She broke up before Xmas because we ended up in an unbalanced space. I really want her back but haven't been acting needy or begging after the breakup. But, I was talking her into trying again 2 times before the final breakup.

We lived together for 4 weeks and still do, but I will leave tomorrow. First weeks were horrible because she instantly started to text and date guys. I left for some time then came back. Lots of fights but last 1,5 weeks I have just accepted it and even been to a couple of dates myself (realized I wasn't ready).

Last night was suppose to be our last, maybe forever. We are in a good place now and she say she really wanna stay friends when later on (I will be gone for a trip now for 1,5 month). Well, we'll see about that. Again I still have feelings for her and she has actually said it might be possible we can start dating again (I saw she meant it, 1 week ago).

But back and forth she is really ignorant. I mean I made food for our supposedly last night yesterday and we had like 1h before she went to sleep due to her coming home late from work. It was mostly me talking and trying to keep up with a conversation. She didn't ask anything about my trip (even people I just met are interested but she has barely asked anything). Instead she texted with friends (this I saw) on her phone when I was talking to her.

Feels really arrogant and just, why? Why would she want us to end up in that kind of place when it could have been our last night? Was she testing me? A problem in our relationship was that I was on her to much about texting and jealous in the end. I just want to know but don't wanna mess up by asking her just before the trip acting needy or something.

Last night will be this night btw... How should I act?

Me (M37), she (F30)."
relationship_advice,How does one get over a best friend hooking up with one's crush?,It's weird that I don't know what to feel u know?

Can't think of a good present.,First of all i'm not sure if this is the right place to post so please tell me if i'm wrong here. We've been texting and talking a lot over the past 6 weeks and decided that we should meet up. Without knowing we set valentines day as the date where i'll meet her so i want to suprise her with a present.

relationship_advice,Gf's parents resent anything sexual,"Myself (M15) and my girlfriend (F15) have been together for almost 4 months now.  Everything has been great, shared my first kiss, and had heaps of awesome, happy, and memorable experiences.

My parents had the 'talk' with me and said all that they had to say and that this is all a part of growing up and what not. For a while the topic of anything sexual had been mutually not spoken about between me and her, but about a month ago we planned on starting to explore each others sexual sides, that i would get to feel her boobs over her bra and she would get to feel my package through my shorts. However her parents have told her that making out can lead onto things and to wait until shes 18 for any of that stuff, but she has told me that she wants to get into this stuff.  Anyways, about 2 and a half weeks ago we were making out and she asked if she could feel it, and then i got to feel her. It was very nice and it was consensual, she enjoyed, i enjoyed it and everything was fine. A while after she told me she wasnt sure wether or not she should talk to her parents and tell them what happened.  However 10 days ago she stopped using her phone, i got a message the next night from one of her mums saying that she will be taking a break from all technology until school goes back. At this point, in the back of my mind i was wondering if they had found out. anyways, 3 days ago i wrote her a letter and put it in her mailbox. And today i got a letter back from her today telling me she felt really guilty for not telling them so she told them, and that they took all technology away from her until school goes back, her parents had read all of out messages and screenshotted some, and that she feels really bad, and that next week her parents want me to go there so that we can all chat. 

I now feel terrible, ive made her go through all this and more that i probably dont know about. And i thought that what we did was normal behavior for people in relationships our age. I dont know why they screenshotted the texts and im not sure exactly why they want me to go there to 'chat'. I understand that she is their daughter. But i feel as if this is damaging myself and her mentally and could be driving a wedge between her and me. I spoke to my parents about this and they said that its normal behavior and that her parents are taking it too far, and that what we did is completely normal behaviour. Im so confused, this is negatively impacting my mental health and really confusing  and scaring me. 

Any advice would be very helpful.  
Thank you"
relationship_advice,My (21) girlfriend told me (25) she started catching feelings for someone else,"So long story short. I'm in a long distance relationship (400-500kms) with a girl I met about 2 years ago. We've had a great relationship so far with no fighting or anything, just a smooth ride. All of a sudden she hit me yesterday with the fact that she's started to develop feelings for someone else (her best friend). 

She's telling me things such as ""I can't control my feelings"" and ""how can I apologize for my feelings, what can I say?"" and she keep reassuring me that I am, in fact, the one she wants to spend her life with.

When breaking the news she told me she'd see herself in a relationship with 2 people, where it'd be equal on all sides etc, I ofcourse rejected this idea completely. I've heard this kind of news from friends, internet posts, etc.. and I've never seen this end well aside from romantic movies.

Today I came clean to tell her that I can't handle this and I want her to think about this before we talk further about this (cause I want to limit the damage I'd do to her, to our relationship). I feel like I'm ready to burst emotionally, like I want to break up cause of the uncertainties I've lost. 

I'm writing this post for advice, please help me understand this. Help me process this before I lose it and might ruin everything because of the uncertainties I feel. Am I making a bigger deal out of it than it is? What can I do about it? Should I do something about it? I thank you in advance, Reddit, even if this might be an unread post found by noone."
relationship_advice,Contact my ex?,"ex (m, 25) broke up with me (f, 23) after 4 month of ldr. That was like a week ago.
Of course i'm fu**** heartbroken.

I did not contact him to let him clear his head and (of course!) to give myself the time to calm down. Furthermore i did not want to chase him.

Long story Short: he did not write yet. I was confused, because this is not his normal behaviour and we did not break up during a fight and neither one of us cheated (etc). He is not thy type for ghosting.

Now a mutual friend told me that my ex thinks that i don't want contact  (which is not the case).

So should i reach out? Or should i wait?"
relationship_advice,Still cant forgive my mum for attempted suicide on my birthday,"So Apologies if this is quite a long post its just something that has plagued me for a while and i've just about run out of ideas now. 

To start off i will say that my mothers last attempt at suicide was over 12 years ago so its been a while but i still cant seem to take solace in that. So to start off i think i need to say that my mother had a really rough life at the start. She was raped by her dad from the age of 7 until she was 14 (he is now dead of natural causes thank god) so that really messed her up. My biological father also didn't help as he was physically and mentally abusive to my mother all the time they were together (they split up when i was 6 months old) and i never really saw him past that.

So all of that being said i now get onto my issue, due to all of the above my mother has never been really fully been right mentally. she has struggled with mental health all her life and she turned to alcohol and drugs a lot because of this. The thing that i cant get over is from the ages of 4-14 in my lifetime i remember being at the hospital almost countless time due to my mother almost over dosing or just really messing herself up. On my 7th and 9th birthday she overdosed trying to kill herself but both of those failed, Needless to say as a child i wasn't myself the most stable. Although all of this happened it just seemed like normality to me and those 2 event don't really bug me, the one i cant get over and not sure how i ever will is on my 14th birthday at around 4am my mum tried to kill herself again, this time it wasn't just an overdose, this time she took a load of pills but then she also slit her wrists. This one devastated me. I remember sitting at the hospital thinking to myself when is this ever going to end? how long is it going to be before she tries this again my next birthday maybe? i started to believe at the time that it was my fault that's why it kept happening on my birthday. I remember thinking that this was just going to be my life from then on. Luckily i was wrong. After the attempt on her life on my 14th birthday she got sectioned. Since then she has gotten married to my step dad who even though i was 16 when he came into my life i call dad and really respect him. My mother hasn't tried anything like this since, doesn't do drugs anymore and only drinks on special occasions. because of this within the last 12 almost 13 years me and my mother do have a relationship where we do speak and still see each other. i act nice and we try to have a normal relationship but no matter how hard i try i can't get over the feeling that one birthday, god knows when she is going to try it again. How can i for 1 ever forgive her and 2 what do i do to get over this? i feel like i've tried everything?

I would also like to add since her last suicide attempt she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is medicated and yes a lot of therapy has been done on both sides. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR. My mother tried killing herself on my birthday 3 separate times, cant get over the last one even though its been almost 13 years. what the fuck can i do to forgive and forget?"

relationship_advice,I don't know if I'm mad at my husband unjustly or not.,"The more I think about it, I feel I'm being silly, but something in my still is irked by this.

 I just started a new job last week, and have been eager to see how much my check is for. I have direct deposit, and I had been checking my account from my phone every couple of hours. 

In the middle of the night last night I got up to use the bathroom and decided to check my phone and see if the deposit was there. (we both have been unemployed for a while now(3+ months) we both finally got jobs, my check was supposed to come a week before his.) I don't see a notification, so I open the app and start logging in.

My husband wakes up and tells me to come back to bed, I tell him to hold on a sec, I'm trying to check my phone and I'll be right back. He then exclaims ""oh I already checked it earlier the checks there"".

I'm not sure why, but I got mad at him. I told him that it's not right for him to check my phone in the middle of the night and decide not to inform me my check has finally deposited.

He just rolled his eyes and said I was over reacting. It has nothing to do with the fact that he checked my phone, that don't care about at all. I am having issues with him knowing I was excited to finally be making my own money, and he knew I was checking it, and he decides to check my phone while I'm sleeping, see that was deposited and didn't say anything to me.

I would have been okay with him waking me up to tell me, I'm not grumpy when someone wakes me up, and he knows that. I decided to just wake up and start my day because I'm pretty angry with him. It feels like he took My excitement away.

Am I being silly or is he being a dick?"

relationship_advice,I'm not physically attracted to my boyfriend,"I'm a (F21) and my boyfriend is (M27) and we've been together for a year and 1 month now. I was really into him from the beginning because he and I click so easily. We enjoy nearly the same hobbies and we always do everything together. Although the physical attraction hadn't been what I expected. We talked about doing things to each other but when it came down to it, it was pretty disappointing. I was pretty much hyped up for something I thought would be great and it just turned out to be really bad, it's at the point where I don't want to do those things with him anymore even though he's always asking me to. He has a problem keeping it up which just kills the mood. For example, I'm minding my own business and he comes to me trying to butter me up and get me going (even though I don't feel like it) and as he keeps going little by little I start to get that feeling. When it's happening he gets hard for a bit, then it just goes down after a few minutes. And then I'm left there unable to do anything. Anything I do can't keep it up and it's honestly frustrating, I've never had an issue with previous partners on that so it's something with him. To top it off the size doesn't help the situation. I've tried to ignore this part of our relationship but I've noticed that it's affecting it. I do love him but at the same time I'm not physically into him and for some reason I tend to pull back a bit when he tries to kiss me. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm bashing him, I'm really not. I just need to hear other people's advice on this since I don't really have anyone to openly talk to about this. Any suggestions on what I should do about this?"
relationship_advice,I feel like I was used and thrown away.,"Hey reddit ,

First, sorry for the long post. I’m having a hard time and I hope I can get some advice in how to deal with this situation. 

At the end of August I met \[M, 26\] a girl \[F, 24\] on tinder. We hang out a few times, had fun and talked a lot. She was amazing and found myself catching feeling things for her. On one of our dates, we kissed and she told me that she had left a relationship a few months ago and wanted to meet people and be alone, but that i was special for her. 

After that night, I noticed that she walked away from me for a few days. I thought she had given up on something with me, but she asked me if we could be together days later. We spent the night together and had sex. That same night I asked her what would happen to us and told her that i getting feeling things for her.She told me that she liked to be with me and wanted to continue to know me, but that she wanted to be with other people (friendly and sexually) as well. I was a little upset, but I said I understood and that it was better for both of us not to continue to see each other for none of us get hurt. She tried to convince me otherwise, but I was firm and said it was the best for both. I was never impolite or treated her badly. I was sad, but I understood that we had different goals. I wanted a real relationship and she just wanted to have fun.

For the next few weeks she would text me as if nothing had happened, but I didn't answer her or, if I did, didn't say much. After that I found her by chance on the street. She came to me and we talked. For 3h she begged me to give her a chance, that she was calmer and wanted to be with me. He confessed that she had sex with other people in the meantime but none of them made sense because she felt things for me and not for them. She also confessed that she was dating a guy but was willing to stop dating him to be with me. She promised me that she had changed and that she knew what she really wanted. 

After this long conversation, I decided to give her an opportunity. Slowly, we began to return to what we were and assumed a relationship for two months. She said she loved me, that it only made sense with me and that she was very happy. Given our beginning, I was a little hesitant and it was hard for me to trust her 100%. I was also hurt in the past so I was cautious. Whenever I felt insecure about something, I would talk to her and we would sort it out. I never pointed a finger at her, just told her how i felt and that i was afraid of losing her. She said there was no problem, that she knew what she wanted, and I could trust her.

One night we went to celebrate, along with some friends, my promotion in my job. I was very happy because I had worked so hard to achieve this goal. That night some of her friends also got together and she was having fun. That night I noticed that she was moving a little away from me. She practically wasn’t with me and was always going with her friends away from me. On the one hand I realized that she wanted to have fun with her friends, so I said nothing to her, on the other I was a little sad as it was a night to celebrate my achievement and we had only been together for a short time that week. 

That same night, coming home, she found a guy with whom she had had sex once before she met me. He was also her friend and is interested in her. A month before she had told me she was going to meet this same guy at a night after being with me, and I was a little puzzled and said i didn't like the idea and that she sure as hell wouldn't like it if I went to be with a girl who was interested in me. She told me that she wasn’t interested in him but agreed and eventually did not go to meet him.

Anyway, that night when we saw him she went to meet him and I stayed a little behind with my friends. The guy began to put his hands on her face, whisper in her ear, kissed her in the cheeks more than once and she did nothing, not even push him away. She just smiled at him. When she returned I was upset. At dawn we spoke at her house about it. I told her i was upstet because i saw the guy kissing her on the cheeks and she had not pushed him away. She told me everything was fine, apologized to me and said she didn't want to hurt anyone, that she was mine and I didn't have to worry. 

The next day I was still a little upset about it. I should never have had that conversation in that night, because I was very sleepy and she was slightly drunk. I spoke to her again that day, never pointing her a finger. I didn't even disrespect her. I just wanted to show her how I felt, cause it hurt me. She told me everything was fine, apologized and said that I was giving her a very negative energy. We solved the matter. That night i met her and noticed she was weird. She even said she didn't feel very good about me. I tried to lighten the weather and we even had fun but I noticed things were kinda tense.

The next day I noticed she was far away. She didn't text me in the afternoon and I didn't want to bother her either, because she was working and I didn't want to be boring. In the evening I asked her if everything was fine with her and she replied by saying that everything was ok, that she was working and that she missed me. That same night I was going to sleep and was just waiting for a good night message from her. She didn't call me like she used to and didn't answer me but was online and texting in a chat group where I was also included. So I texted her asking her to answer me, that i wanted to go to sleep. She said she had not answered me because she wanted to send me a good night message and she was working. I apologized to her for insisting, said that I had no right to demand her attention but that I was a little reactive and was still thinking a lot about the things that had happened lately. She said she loved me, that I just had to trust her and that I could tattoo everything she said to me.

The next day she didn't call me saying good morning, which she always did when she came home from work. She sent a very short message telling me she had come home. I called her, we talked a little and asked her if she wanted to be with me that day. She said no because she already had things combined with her friends. I felt a little sad and anxious. I was noticing something odd about her behavior.

That night I asked her to be with me because I wanted to talk to her. I told her I needed her help, because I couldn't forget what happened and that if she was my girlfriend, I thought she should know what I felt. She told me she had already apologized to me and was sick of talking about it. She also said that she wasn’t feeling good with me and that I was suffocating her and giving her negative energy. She told me it was my fault and that I was getting trouble in the relationship, that if I was happy we would end up together. I got scared and apologized to her, and said I didn't want to make her feel bad, that i just wanted to speak with her about what I was feeling . I also told her that I was very hurt in the past (she knew all my history) and that I just didn't want to lose her. She said she was beginning to realize why my ex girlfriends left me. I felt genuinely bad because I was just asking for her support and she was being really cold and insensitive to me. I told her we had a rocky start and she said she did everything she could.

As we spoke, I noticed something strange in her eyes, as if she had something to hide from me. When I asked her what she had to say, she confessed that from the beginning she knew she didn't like me as much as I liked her. She told me that thought she would like it on the same level as me with time, but that the feeling always dwindled. I stopped being sad at that moment and felt angry and deceived. She apologized to me when I was yelling but I didn't accept it and I left without even looking back at her. She had promised me so much and out of nowhere she said she knew that from the beginning she didn't like me the way she said. I even told her that I felt cheated and upset with her. She lied to me.

After that i blocked her from all social media and never heard from her again. It's been two months and I still find myself sad. I feel cheated and angry. 

I ask your help and possible advices you might give me, please."
relationship_advice,I love my girlfriend but her jealousy and anger have destroyed my confidence in our relationship.,"My girlfriend (35F) and I (31NB) have been together since May last year. Sparks started flying pretty much as soon as we met and we have strong feelings for each other. Though initially we both shared a common interest in nonmonogamy we soon decided that we wanted to be in a committed monogamous relationship with each other. I explained clearly what this involved for me (no kissing, sleeping with or flirting with anyone else; being open about our feelings and our connections with others) and I felt we had a good foundation for building trust. She said she felt insecure, and I tried to reassure her that I was totally on board with our relationship and my commitment to her. A few months in I moved to her country so we could spend more time together and she could feel more secure about us. I spent a while looking for work here so did not have much money and had no choice but to stay at her apartment, although I would prefer to have my own room and stay at her place a few times a week. Unfortunately despite my best efforts, our relationship has been plagued by ongoing painful fights centred mostly around other women in my life.

One involved me sending semi-regular texts to my last ex-girlfriend, another was caused by my suggesting that I was thinking of spending a day with a female friend who I had confessed I had had a crush on a year before, and another was because I started renting a shared room and didn't first consider that there might be a woman staying there (my GF had angrily told me to move out a few days before that, and as I was broke I could only afford a shared twin room in the city, and I was the only tenant there when I entered). I stopped texting my ex, I cancelled the meeting with my friend, and it turned out a sweet older married man moved into the room, and even if it were a woman I would have looked for another room anyway, so in the end there were no problems. However while we were trying to deal with these situations my girlfriend repeatedly escalated them into fights, accusing me of acting very badly by even tolerating them, or of secretly having other motivations that these situations were probably covering up, usually both. She repeatedly said she was 'sure' I was going to keep texting my ex forever, or going to invite my friend to sleep at my place, or would probably sleep with a random woman if I shared a room with her. 

I felt insulted at how much she believed these things instead of my actual feelings and motivations, even when I tried to make these very clear. I tried to explain that I wanted to find solutions together and that I thought her reactions were unacceptable, and asked her to show the basic level of trust in my word that I showed to her. Her response repeatedly was to shout at or hang up on me, call me a lot of angry names, and break up with me. She even contacted one of my friends out of the blue who she had never met, to tell a distorted version of the twin-room story to make me look bad. She considers me a selfish asshole for even considering that those situations could be okay, and even more so for asking her to talk them over calmly before jumping to conclusions or to consider how her explosive anger hasa negative impact on me emotionally. I think she is someone who deep down is very insecure and also comes from a culture where cheating is more common and jealousy is more normalised within the society, which is just very far from my experience (she is from a South American country and I am from Northern Europe). However when concrete situations arise where she feels jealous she is rarely able to acknowledge her own feelings and tends to try to make me totally responsible for them, even when I am not trying to make her jealous at all.

She also seems to have a very obvious double standard. My girlfriend keeps in touch with at least four of her exes. I don't really track who she keeps in contact with and I actually feel embarrassed asking to see her messages as she does to me, but when I do see her phone their names come up pretty regularly. One of those is her last ex, who she was sleeping with a few weeks before we started talking, and who she stated she was in love with - which is more than I can say for my last ex or for my friend who I never even told about the crush. However my girlfriend said she wanted to be closer friends with this guy, and talked about meeting up with him on several occasions which I was okay with, and she even invited him to her place a few weeks ago to have lunch with us, without asking me about it first. I don't see any reason to be jealous of her hanging out with her ex if I feel she is being open with me and I see she is still respecting the commitment we made to each other. However, considering how she has treated me in relation to other women in my life I think her behaviour is hypocritical. When I've tried to express this she gets angry and always finds a reason why her talking to her exes is fine and normal but the situations I described above are totally unacceptable. Honestly to this day I still don't understand her reasoning and I think she is being unfair without realising it.

In one of our worst fights, my girlfriend broke up with me and told me to get out of her apartment again, even calling the police and throwing my shoes out the door. They didn't come but I felt totally humiliated by the situation. I was emotionally dazed for a week and spent most time outside of work crying or trying to find some kind of psychological help from friends, books, helplines etc. A few weeks before I had also gotten angry at her over the continued accusations about the nonexistent woman in my room, and I told her to get out of my room one morning when she was visiting. I felt guilty, and although she blocked me over this, five days later I wrote her a long apology by email. But later she did the same thing but worse, and wrote no letter or message to me, to this day she never apologised. One morning while she was still ignoring me I got a sudden sinking feeling and decided to sign back into the dating site where we had met, which I had previously found she had been using after we had had a fight. This time I saw she was online again with a beautiful updated profile marked 'single'. I felt devastated. I was still waiting to hear from her and would only ever consider re-joining a dating site after sitting down and having a serious conversation deciding we wanted to end our monogamous commitment and move on. I felt betrayed and humiliated. A week later she again changed her mind and invited me back to stay at her place. I felt I had pretty much lost trust that our relationship would ever be stable or really trustworthy again, but I still loved her, and I felt awful about the idea of us breaking up for good, so I said we would try again.

I miss her a lot when we're apart and I feel so comfortable around her. But the pain from these kind of fights just keeps accumulating, and I have found she is not willing to acknowledge her actions or the impact they have on me. She has continued to find other people to be jealous about in my life, and to find other situations where I am again supposedly betraying her and throwing away our relationship, even though this is the opposite of what I want to do. I just don't know how to handle her anger anymore. I feel that no matter how much I cut other people out of my life and make her the centre of it, it will never be enough. (And lately I have hardly been talking to any of my friends at all. I feel depressed about all fights we've had and I don't know how to talk to anyone about them without potentially making my girlfriend more angry, as she asks to read my messages.) I feel resentment and pain building up inside me and I know I need to express it, but I just don't want to fuel any more fights with my girlfriend. I am emotionally exhausted.

How can I deal with my girlfriend's jealousy? Is there anything I can do to help her take more responsibility for her actions, and to confront with my impression that her behaviour seems to express a double standard? How can I create healthy boundaries without escalating the situation and firming further conflict? How can I know if our relationship is worth the pain or if it would actually be healthier to break up?

TLDR: my GF and I are in a monogamous relationship and I have stuck to that. However she has repeatedly escalated fights over situations where she believes I am betraying her in some way, and rejected me (insulting, breaking up, throwing me out) and then changed her mind repeatedly. I don't see her as reliable anymore. I feel hurt by much of this but haven't been able to have a constructive conversation about it despite trying, and I'm now exhausted by the continued fighting. I don't want to lose her but I can't stand mistreatment anymore and I don't know how to move forward."

relationship_advice,This situation hurts...,"Last year I (19M) met this amazing girl (17F). I loved speaking to her so much even whilst being super nervous, I developed a massive crush on her only to find out shortly after that she had a boyfriend (18M). This made things super uncomfortable for me as she is the only girl who I've had a crush on that I spoke to, whilst we still worked at the same retail job I tried to just be friendly and not confess anything to her. She left this job about 3 ish months ago but we have kept in touch because we made good friends of eachother. Unfortunately I think about her everyday, I've tried speaking to other girls but it doesn't help and makes me feel guilty I'm thinking of someone else.

Not sure what else to add really, I don't know if I'm looking or advice or just getting it off my chest but if you could drop a comment about anything that'd be appreciated."
relationship_advice,Left my bf out in the cold and I don’t know if I did the right thing. Guilt’s killing me,"Bf’s father died few months ago and he just arrived back from homeland. We met for few hours and since he insisted he wanted to go to this place, we went there too. Even though I was suppose to be home an hour ago. Then on top of that he wanted me to drop him off, did that too. However, his ex lives across him and he wanted to kiss me goodbye. He asks me to pull up near his ex’s apartment and tries to kiss me. While he’s trying to kiss me he keeps looking over at his ex’s apartment. I told him I wasn’t in the mood for it right now and told him why. I then asked him to get off and go home as I’m already late. He still didn’t get off so I drove him near my place so I could reach home sooner. In between driving from his place to mine I stopped 4 times asking him to get off because I’m really going back to my place and not turning back to drop him off again. He still didn’t get off. He would keep turning the heat on highest setting when he knows it’s going to affect my eyes. I was wearing lenses. He would fuck with the heat setting and wouldn’t let me listen to music in my own car on the way to my place. Then the 4th time I stopped, asked him to take an Uber. Now he has money yet I still insisted to pay for his ride back home if that was the issue. He was busy giving me the silent treatment for about 10 mins straight. Then I tried to explain to him why I can’t drop him home again; I’m already an hour and half late. He still didn’t care. All he wanted was me to drop him back home in my car. Then he starts acting like he’s trying to see my true colors by testing my boundaries again and again. I refused to drop him back and asked him to stop threatening to me drop him back home by using the words “in future I’ll do something like this too”. Asked him to stop threatening me in my own damn car. So he gets out the car by telling me I can’t be with a woman with so much attitude. Then he starts walking away and I left in 2 mins to go at my place.  
I reached home, he reaches home in 30mins. Then I recalled he didn’t have a phone service and was using my hotspot while he was with me. So he couldn’t call an Uber while he was walking his way home. 

Now I would have dropped him home, be out late if I didn’t have a toxic family dynamic. I had to reach home for a reason. My parents are abusing me and cutting off my social life and any relationship I have outside of a parent child relationship with them for the last 11 years. I(23F) have a narc father and an enabler codependent mother who has groomed me to be home and to be a people pleaser for the last 11 years. It’s bad how I didn’t get to have a life or the freedom other Teenagers had for the last 11 years. And my bf knows this. Maybe he was trying to get me to not fear my parents and break my grooming patterns. Idk. But what I do know is, my bf is a narc too. He doesn’t know how to respect people’s boundaries. He thinks everybody should adjust simply because he thinks everybody should. And I’m not the type to follow through everything he wants to me do and be.  At least not after what my parents have been manipulating me like. 

In this case, I feel my bf wants me to cater to his every need and I can’t be his goddamn mother. I’ve limits and he doesn’t get it. I try to be nice but I can’t be overly nice to him and agree to everything he wants me to do. But then the guilt creeps in for leaving him walking in the winter at 10:30 in the night. Then he texts me “you left me in an unknown place in the cold” which to I replied, no, I didn’t. I offered you a paid ride back home and you didn’t like the idea of it. You’re too stubborn on wanting it the way you want it be. 

Did I do anything wrong or am I just falling for the gaslighting technique and blame shifting and playing the victim part that narcs use?"
relationship_advice,How to tell my newish friend I made plans with someone else tonight?,"I recently made friends with a co-worker and I adore her. We've hung out a handful of times and established a friendship last weekend. Today, I know she might want to grab happy hour with me but I made plans with someone I recently met and also really like/don't wanna flake on.

I know it's healthy to have multiple friends, set bounderies and ""say no"" but I struggle with co-dependancy and saying no to avoid conflict or upsetting the person I care about. My co-worker/friend has never demanded my time, energy or utmost loyalty, she is not the problem here.

I just need to know how to tell her I got plans with someone else tonight in a way that doesn't jilt her. Most likely, she won't at all think anything of it and I'm being anxioud for no reason but I still wanna prepare and avoid saying the wrong thing just in case...."

I feel like I need to owe him some loyalty since we all had a hard childhood and we always looked out for each other but I also feel like his GF deserves to not be treated this way and if he's not invested in it anymore then he should move on from the relationship in a way that doesn't leave her feeling like shit. 

To this point I have told him to stop cheating and give her the time of day to talk through their relationship and where it should go, write a pros and cons list of what his decisions will lead to, and to think about how this will all make her feel. I realise this is pretty weak but I am at a loss as to how to deal with this, hence this post. I know he's being trash by doing this but he's also one of my best friends.   


Some advice would be great, keep the criticisms to a minimum, it's not an easy decision and I don't feel like stepping into something I have no right to step into."
relationship_advice,Is Casual Sex Bad For You?,[removed]
relationship_advice,"My Friend (21M) broke our friendship, because I told I didn't want to be with him next year in the same city, am I (21M) at the wrong?"," \`ThrowRA\` 

I did a post in the past, about my problem with my friend and about how I think our personalities are not compatible and about his toxicity:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/egq3ei/i\_am\_m21\_and\_my\_friend\_m21\_have\_a\_complicated/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/egq3ei/i_am_m21_and_my_friend_m21_have_a_complicated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

So Basically, I don't see us as long-term friends, and he felt that because when he asked me about my postgraduate for next year I always brush it of, because I don't want to be with him.

 Until tonight he asked if I want to be with him in the same city next year?

I said: that the best for each of us is to start new experience and each find a group friends from the same country, and I said: that I don't hate our current friendship, but for me I don't want to stick together because I want to experience a new city on my own.

He was mad and said: that friendship is not like this (in his mind he says that if we considered our self friends we should continue as friends) , and he said: being together does not stop us from making other friends and that with my mind set I was using him to hang out with until the end of this year.

I apologized about how he felt and that I should have told him this before, I told him that I had my own personal reasons and that in my mind its ok to be friends with someone for a limited time and then go apart, and our relationship meant something to me. I also apologized if I sent him signals that our friendship was long-term, and in my mind its not.

So then he said he does not wanna be friends anymore, and I said that cool.

**Should I feel shit because I saw an expiry date on our friendship?** I mean for me I consider that friendship, and he stuck with as much as I stuck with him.  I think my mistake was I might acted as if our relationship was as a long term one, but in my mind it was short-term (but I don't see a problem with being friends with someone and sticking together for a limited time). And thats why he might feel betrayal."
relationship_advice,My [21m] depressed GF [21f] refuses therapy even though she absolutely needs it!,"Dating 19 months. I think we're doing ok. Our biggest problem is no sex in almost 7 months. I'm staying in the relationship hoping it'll change one day. Losing hope. Feeling depressed when we have sleepovers.

We see each other once a week for a weekly date. We live 50 minutes away. In the beginning we would have sex on our sleepovers. That completely changed 7 months ago.

She is depressed. She graduated nursing school 4 years ago and never really studied for her board exam. She worked part time as a CNA. 4 years later here she is working as a CNA with a nursing degree but no license. She did a review boot camp for a month recently but did not pass her board exam.

I am also a nursing student. I have offered multiple times to have study dates. We can do practice questions together and compare answers. She just says ""maybe or I don't know"".

I know she is in a huge rut right now. She has told me she doesn't know what is going on in her life. And is a ""hopeless case"". She said that.

She told me she has no libido and has no desire for sex anymore. I take care of myself well. I go the gym. I dress well. She always compliments me and tells me she is attracted to me. I'm confident her stress is killing her libido.

I asked her in the past for therapy and she declined. Now i'm at a point where I think she either needs individual therapy or couples therapy. I recommended it tonight and she just simply says no. It's depressing because I feel like she has no desire to better herself or the relationship. And i'm over here SUPER passionate about us and our obstacles. She still receives handwritten letters and flowers from me monthly. She still holds me when we're out and about. Other than that the intimacy is gone. No sex. No making out.

She is immature for her age. I said it straight out. She lacks even basic communication skills. I explained to her in the beginning of our relationship how we need to work on it and I have seen some improvement. But it's still terrible. She refuses to talk in person face-to-face about issues. Only text. And if she feels like we are arguing over text she will turn off the read-receipts (I can't see she read my text) or she will ignore me or BOTH. I'm very mature for my age. You are more than welcome to tell me ""i'm full of myself"", however I'm very well aware of the effort I put into my relationship and the emotional maturity I possess. I work part time and am 1.5 years from graduating my own nursing program while trying to maintain a loving relationship.

The lack of sex and her lack of passion towards the relationship is really starting to make me consider if this relationship is worth it.

Any advice reddit?

TLDR: GF is depressed and our sex life is gone. She is refusing therapy."
relationship_advice,How do me(M) and my girlfriend ask her brother to move out of our apartment without ruining the relationship between him and us,"The reason we want him to leave is because he acts like a child...

-We have to ask him to wash all his dishes otherwise they will sit their for days.. collecting bugs.

-He never wipes the table after he creates a mess.

-He makes the bathroom filthy everytime he shaves, he just leaves the shavings all over the sink..

-We have to cook him dinner every night and it's the food we pay for, he never pays for dinner or cooks the food we buy(he only buys his own snacks and breakfast).

-He uses our laundry powder/tablets, which adds up to a lot of money overtime


To be honest having him has had a major effect on me and my gfs mental health and we have grown very un happy, he is literally like having a child who doesn't listen no matter how many times we ask him to do something, it's so frustrating. I'm starting to think he's psychotic because of the fact he has not picked up the fact we want him to be clean despite asking him 10s of times.

We only took him in because he broke up with his gf and we didn't think he'd stay for long because he would be starting uni and make new friends and neither of those have happened...

How do we ask him to leave?


TLDR: gfs messy brother is ruining our mental health and we want him to leave."
relationship_advice,Ex (29M) broke up with me (28F) 2 days before his birthday. Not sure what to do.,"We only dated 3 months but it was pretty intense. Over the past month, he was getting tired of me being insecure and constantly talking about us. I had my reasons around the lack of sex, being distant but knew he was stressed.

My anxiety had also been flaring up lately and I stupidly brought something up again after a great date. He then dumped me by text. He offered to meet to end things on a good note but I just chose to ignore him from then onwards because I thought it was still kinda mean. He could've called at least to say what he needed to say.

I had plans with his friends for his birthday. I will stay well away. Yet, I do miss him and feel it's really mean to not wish him a happy birthday. I wonder if my ego of cutting him off is really hurting any chances of getting  back together. Then I'm conflicted because I feel like ending things on a good note just makes him feel better since this is how most of his relationships ended and makes him feel justified for not treating me well the last month.

So, I wanted to ask:
1. Do I wish him a happy birthday and leave it at that? Because I might come off as cold otherwise and it's not like we had a  bad breakup. I just dont want to be friends either because all it does is help the dumper and will give me false hope.

2. Am I right to be angry about being dumped by text even though he offered to meet at his place to talk? I didnt see the point in talking just to end things on a good note. I can see he must've been mad at me for asking if he was stringing me along.

3. If tempers cool off and a year down the line, we work on ourselves, is me never speaking to him ruining chances of us ever getting back? 

Tl;Dr could you please help out with q1,2 and 3? :p"
relationship_advice,I (M27) was just baited by my best friend; thought I was texting a woman who I've been talking to in person.,"I started talking to a woman. We've known each other for a few years. I just recently became attracted to her so got her number and we've been texting for about a week. Haven't outwardly said I'm interested so I've been just flirty but subtly so both in person and over text. Last night I laid it on thick and went to bed as I wanted to get the point across and figured I'd either wake up to a text of her going with it or not and that'd tell me whether she's interested in me. 

I just wake up to a text saying, ""Hey babe how are you this morning ;-)"". I played it cool said just cold and tired just woke up. She kept coming back with super provocative replies. Eventually said she was getting ready for work and asked if I wanted a pic. I just said ""sure"". Well then she teases me with a ""that doesn't sound like you want it that bad"". And I reply with a ""Yes, send me a pic if you want"". 

I get a picture from her and it's a selfie of my best friend. I was half asleep and took me a second to understand. From the ""Hey babe"" comment on it was him on her phone. She had noticed my behavior but didn't make the connection I was hitting on her went to my buddy about it and asked him (he knew what I was doing). So he told her I was flirting with her then asked to see our conversation on her phone and proceeded to text me that to mess with me.

Not gonna lie. Love him to death, but I'm pretty disappointed in him RN. Kinda feel like I don't wanna talk to him for awhile to be honest. Am I overreacting? I let him know I was bummed but he keeps telling me he knows I had no chance with her (even though she never said not implied that) so that's why he did it.

TL;DR - Best friend posed as a woman I've been flirting with to fuck with me for a laugh, may have just destroyed any chance I had with her."
relationship_advice,My bf (24) had a threesome with his best (male) friend before (also around 24),"Okay so my boyfriend and his best friend had a threesome with another girl and I can’t get it out of my head now..

He got kinda mad and upset when I told him it makes me uncomfortable."
relationship_advice,"I'm 24M, my wife[34F] wants us to pay for something I think is unnecessary","Hello and thank u so much for ur advice.

I'm currently living with my wife and her kids from another marriage. But their dad disappeared so we kinda consider me their dad.

We live in a very poor African country. I'm actually from a South American country which we are going to in the hope to find a better job and all. Honestly, I don't want to go back, but she wants us to go back so we are going.

Anyway, we are struggling a lot with money for a long time. I worked online and I usually pay for almost everything. She works as well but here the wages are very low. So I would say I pay 80% and she pays 20.

But we do live in her family's property for free.

Anyway, as I said, we are really struggling with money. We do have food, electricity, everything, but it's always close to the edge. There is so much I wanted to do not for me but for the kids and I can't. Their bike broke from example and I wanted so much to pay 20us to fix but I'm afraid if I do we might need it later.

And now, her daughter was promoted at her school. She was like the best of the class or something. I don't really get what it means since it's more of a local thing but my wife is soooo proud of her.

But now, because of this promotion, she has to use a new uniform. Not everyone, but just her, because she was the best.

And the new uniform is bloody 50us. We don't have that! Like, maybe we do, but it's so much!

But my wife really wants it. Me, from my perspective, I don't see the importance of all. If she is the best in the class, why does she need to pay more than the others? It makes no sense. It just seems like a scam from the school. I can't see why she can't be the best in the class without the uniform.

But my wife really wants it. And it puts me in a very hard situation. Now, when I say I didn't have, she went to ask her mom, who's getting a loan for it.

I said that it will all went back to me. Because if they can't pay the loan eventually I will have to. Or they will take money from something else and I will have to cover. I told that to her of course, not her mom.

I guess I am being kind of a jerk. Like, I should have just politely said I don't have it and if she is going try to get the money other way is not of my business.

I guess I could pay for it. But I'm just afraid I might need that money in the future. What if someone gets sick and needs to go to the doctor? Or someone's phone brakes and needs fixing?

So, it's hard. I guess it's just adulthood problems. We fought and now we are not even talking.

Thank u so much for your answers."
relationship_advice,My [26F] BF [26M] of 5 years isn’t ready for marriage. How long do I wait?,"We were great friends before dating and have lived together for 4 years. I’d say our relationship has always been pretty happy - he is the kindest person I know, we have a similar sense of humor, have common interests, share similar political/religious beliefs and feel comfortable to truly be ourselves with each other. We are both financially comfortable but haven’t saved quite enough to buy a house.

The only thing that concerns me is that he has always been someone who enjoys routine life and lives in the present, and doesn’t plan too far ahead. He is happy to do the dishes every day, stay home and cuddle, but doesn’t plan for special occasions (eg. didn’t make plans or get cake for my past two birthdays, and asked me what I wanted to do on the day of). I’ve initiated or planned nearly every special date or vacation in our relationship. 

I get that his day-to-day actions speak more than occasional grand gestures, but I would love for him to want to get married on his own accord (instead of me nudging him into it). It would indicate to me that he has really thought seriously about it and genuinely wants me in his future.

I’ve asked about marriage before and he thinks I’m the one, but wasn’t quite ready to get married yet and doesn’t know when he’ll be ready. I understand we’re still pretty young, but I’d like to know if it’s in the next 3-4 years perhaps. I don’t want to be a long term GF.

Am I being immature by wanting him to bring up marriage independently? How often should we discuss future marriage, and how do I go about the conversation without issuing an ultimatum? Are there red flags or signs that mean I should consider leaving?

TL;DR: BF is reliable and responsible but doesn’t know when he wants to get married. I love him very much but don’t know how long to wait."
relationship_advice,I lied and now need help,"So.. it’s extremely awkward but i didn’t expect it to go this far. I met this girl almost a year ago. It was online and distant and was supposed to be extremely temporary. I lied about who i was and what i did for a living. I made up a mostly fake past about myself because at the time i was ashamed of who i was. I was out of work and down in the dumps big time.. so i lied. Its been almost a year and i kept the lie going. I changed it and have tried to adapt it into my real life as much as possible (such as i don’t work their anymore and I’m not that person anymore). For the most part I’m getting away with it, I can’t tell her it would break her heart. I do love this girl and she really wants to meet me. I want to meet her but I’m worried that she will bring it up with my family. I have tried to tell her to just forget i was ever like that and that I’m a new person.. but if she asked my family then the cat would be out of the bag. She has promised to forget it and move on but i know its all in the back of her mind and it comes up from time to time. 

Help! How do i fix this without telling her. Its been a year i cant just say “the person you met and fell in love with is a lie”. Please i want to marry this girl someday"
relationship_advice,I (21f) don't think I'm my boyfriend's (25m) type and it's affecting my self esteem. How do I overcome this?,"Hi folks, throwaway because he uses reddit, also because I'm pretty embarassed about all this. We've been together close to 3 years now.

**Context** We were obviously young when we got together, and he's my first serious relationship (I've had 2 others, neither lasted more than a couple months) and I was very insecure going in. I've grown a lot both together with him and independently since, and I've learned to love myself much more. We're also very in love, and friends and family comment on how strong our relationship is and how close we are. 

His two relationships before me were both longer, and both girlfriends were thin with very petite/small frames . When we met, both of us had maybe 15-20lbs extra and have worked it off together. I stopped a bit as I'm happy where I am and just occasionally do stuff, but he's continued (casually) and has gotten a bit of muscle even.

**This uneasiness started because** many months ago he was showing me a female youtuber who's known most for her eating disorder/body, and we were watching her videos and complimenting her when he said, ""yeah, if she just put on just a *tiny* bit more weight she'd be perfect"". I didn't react at the time, but after processing it later I realized I not only disliked what he was essentially supporting (that being that unhealthily thin is good), but it also made me feel bad about my own body. Again, I'm not by any means chubby, but I'm short with a slightly wider frame for my height (I'm not petite). 

I brought it up later and talked to him about how it made me feel and even specifically said I don't feel like I'm his type. (Note: he does compliment me all the time, saying I'm cute, pretty, etc). After I let it all out and told him, he stayed quiet for a bit and all he could really say was, ""well, I think everyone should somehow work out a little."" and began to talk about how unhealthy everyone in the world is today and started talking about how great he feels having lost that tiny bit of chub he had. I felt like this didn't address what I was talking about at all, and told him so. He tried defending himself more but I told him I was done with the topic and I wasn't in the place to talk about it anymore (He reassured me after about how much he likes me and how attracted he is to me, etc).

-----

These thoughts went away for a while, but I've started to notice very recently that if there's anything negative I can pick up from the things he says about my looks I (internally) take it way too harshly. I'm slowly becoming more sensitive (enough to make me post here), and I want it to stop. I don't give in, because I love what I'm doing for myself, but in the back of my mind I want to do all I can to make him like me. Small, insignificant things like not wearing high waisted pants (he doesn't prefer them, but has never ever minded that I wear them), we go shopping together and any clothes I love that get an ""it's alright"" from him go back on the shelf, or I push myself to wear form fitting dresses or crop tops despite being a bit uncomfortable (I actually love the dresses now so that's a small +). Even today, when I told him I started doing butt exercises again he didn't react too great and just said, ""I don't think you need to but you do you"" and now I'm down again when it wasn't hurtful in the slightest.

What can I do to stop thinking so negatively?"
relationship_advice,Is this a valid reason to end a LDR?,"I (27M) am in an LDR with a girl I think is pretty amazing (32F).  However, at this point, we might only see each other for a week every 2-3 months (or even 6months).  Her work involves a lot of travel.  Most recently, we planned (weeks in advance) for me to go see her, but due to last minute changes in her schedule, it has made her schedule very chaotic.  She has to travel back to her place for the week to see me, still work a few days while I'm there, and then go back to where she was once I leave.  To be clear, I don't blame her for schedule changes beyond her control.  But I will say I'm a bit disappointed, bc I took time off and got plane tickets and will now end up sitting around in an apartment without her during the day. I offered to reschedule my trip, but 1) there's no guarantee a conflict won't happen again and 2) it's already been 6months since we've seen each other.

I respect what she's trying to accomplish and am supportive of her career, but I'm wondering if it's not the best time for our kind of relationship.  I appreciate the effort she made to make time for us, but I don't want to be added complexity to her life.  Because of the distance, last minute visits are a little complicated but as we just saw, even with careful advanced planning, scheduling conflicts happen (and may happen again). 

I know breaks are usually breakups with more steps, but should I suggest we take one?"
relationship_advice,Am I hurting my partner with my worries?,"I have consistent paranoia, (I'm not sure if that's the word for it, but I've been told many times so Im going with that, correct me if this descrption isn't that, please) I see every little detail though I don't jump to conclusions such as if he's cheating on me kind of stuff or in general. I seek things like if I missed a hint of worry in someone's voice or how I let go of my partners hand and if it hurt their feelings. Its all over the place, I'm not sure if I have a mental illness, its always there but it only really bothers me when it comes to my partner or best friend. I get extremely worried that I've done bad/wrong.

So that's my situation to correlate it with my partner, I have done a few things that I thought it had put me in the position to be at fault for him losing a ton of friends. He has reassured me time and time again, but I can't help but be guilty and apologize over and over for it! My mind keeps telling me that he's gonna leave me because of all the crap I give him with my worries. I apologizie so much and tell him he deserves better that he could do better than better and I'm scared its  toxic?..Lately he's been feeling..numb? Like quiet less talkative and he says it'll blow over that he is very aware that his mood has depleted and his facial expressions aren't what they usually are. That itll blow over..Could I have caused that?"
relationship_advice,I get angry and frustrated when my boyfriend orgasms and I don’t... is it unfair or is he selfish?,"I usually cum during sex but I always feel rushed that I have to orgasm quickly before him because I know that when he cums it’s the end of it. He won’t even try to get me off. And even though the sex is great I really feel bad when I get so turned on and don’t climax. So this is what normally happens after he cums: we lay and cuddle for a bit, then I’ll try to get him aroused again, he will push me away, I’ll get frustrated and mad at him for not wanting to have sex again, he then feels like sh*t like he isn’t enough, he gets mad at me for making him feel bad, then I’m going to feel guilty for even telling him and I’ll end up apologizing. 
I don’t understand, am I being superficial and too demanding? Is he right when he says I’m never happy with what he gives me?
I tried asking him why he wont have sex a second time and he says its because he becomes insensitive down there and can’t be stimulated. But how long should I wait before he can become hard again? Isn’t 10/15 minutes enough? Really dont know what to think about this situation. Should I stop trying afterwards and just get off by my self when he leaves?"
relationship_advice,My furry boyfriend,"So basically i was dating this furry (yes people who dress up as the big animals) guys for a few months until he decided to break up with me saying he wasn’t ready for a serious relationships for numerous reasons; yes i am going to list them all; he stated that it was because of past relationships traumas, then continued saying he had to focus on school (his last year of college) and his music (he makes beats and stuff).
He said that he still loved me but couldn’t keep the relationship because he didn’t wanna hurt me and it was exhausting for him. I tried to stay friends with him but he stopped talking to me on the premise that it was hard for him not want to be with me and stay friends at the same time. 
Ever since I’ve been waiting for him to finish college and hope he will text me; help, am I being dumb for waiting for him or is there still hope!?

relationship_advice,Should I try and get back my girlfriend?,My (17M) girlfriend (17f) just broke up with me after 11 months because she didn't enjoy hugging while I did. I feel so sad without her. I told her right before we broke up that I would be fine with the lack of physical contact if that's how she wanted it but she said that she didn't want me to feel bad because of my way of showing affection. For the time being I have cancelled the dates that were organised at restaurants but feel upset that the relationship was ended by something so little. I was curious should I try and be with her again or give it time and try to move on?
relationship_advice,Is my GF being too flirty or am I paranoid?,"Some backstory: 

me(20M) and my GF(22F) went to the same university, we met there and after 2 semesters being friends we started dating. She also have an ex in the same university and a lot of ""friends"" (guys that ask her out and stuff). Despite all that we never had any problem regarding this kind of stuff, since she always said that she despises cheating like I do.

Fast foward 2 months and she is now on a business trip and we've been in touch through messages and video calls, everything going well although we miss each other. But in the last couple of days she seems more distant, going out with her friends instead of going on video calls with me and disappearing for an entire day without any texts. 

Although makes me a little bit sad its not that serious, she must have a little bit of freedom and free time with her friends, trust is something important in a relationship and I don't want her feel like she's trapped. 

Well, yesterday she posted a photo in the beach (the place she went on business near the sea and she went to the beach sunday) on Instagram. Nothing out of ordinary, guys commented, girls commented as well, but there's this one guy who was constantly asking her out who commented on her pic saying how gorgeous she was etc, typical guy hitting on stuff, the problem is that she answer back with the lines of "" You're the most handsome and smart guy I've ever met in college"".

That really hurted me, but I also may be overthinking all this. What do you guys think?

relationship_advice,Sister in law with severe OCD,"Obligatory Alt account- so I married into a Chinese family that lives in SE Asia. My wife and I live in another country away from her folks. Her siste (30) r has severe OCD. Some examples include taking 5-6 hr showers to feel clean, using toothpaste tube once, then tossing it,  washing hands 10-15 minutes, forcing her parents to do laundry every night. She basically controls her parents s every action, especially the mom. Over the past 10 years, they've essentially given her control over their lives (everything except $$). They've tried forcing her to a mental health center when she got violent, but after she got out (after about a year) she reverted back to habits before.

relationship_advice,"My best friend (M23) wants to travel around the world with me (F24), I'm in love with him, he is not","So maybe the people I'm going to talk about will see this because I'm pretty sure I know this subreddit from them but I'm too lazy to create a new account for this and oh well... Hi, what's up ?

So basically all my friends are my ex's friends. After a few month of not talking to eachother after the breakup, we started to talk again and now he's one of my favourite person ever. But I'm actually not here to talk about him, he's my bro, I love him in an uncomplicated way.

The stupid thing I did when that guy dumped me was getting closer with one of his friend. Very funny charming guy who suggested we have friendly sex shortly after the breakup. The thing you have to know is that I thought I was asexual before I met the first guy. Turns out not so much, I'm just VERY picky. So when I realised I was attracted to the second guy it was weird for me.

We went from just friends to nudes sending friends on and off for a few weeks until we saw eachother, hooked up. He had a girlfriend at the time (yeah I suck I'm sorry)

I don't know when I realised I loved him but when I did it felt like it had been a while. How bad I felt when he talked about other girls was a good giveaway.. It actually didn't took me long to tell him (as a friend he's really good to talk to, helps me to express myself a lot, and I trust him), we still had sex even though he told me he didn't feel the same and never will because he is ""unable to love"".

So I talk every day with him, my ex and their other friends on discord, it's the best part of my day, I love them all dearly and tbh never had such wonderful relationships.

Last week we visited my ex and took a airbnb with my crush (let's call him that) had a lot of sex, cuddled a lot, when he left I cried for two days... It was not fun. But my god those few days were NICE ! My ex says it's not very nice of him to act like that when he knows he doesn't romantically love me.

Now, yes I know that he doesn't love me, he talks a lot about other girls, tells me very upfrontly that yeah no this is not happening. That he's my very good friend but we'll never be in a relationship. It kinds of makes me sad but at the same time I'm not too sure that's exactly what I want. Idk..

ANYWAYS, the other day he asked me if I wanted to go to Korea for a month with him. Travel, work on some projects we have together. Of course yes I want to do that... It quickly became a Asia trip, maybe also the US (we're Europeans), it sounds so exciting ! But the thing is, how am I supposed to move on then ? How bad will it feel to be so far away from home when he gets with other girls ? But an adventure like that, when will that opportunity come back ? So yeah... Reddit what do I do because frankly I am lost ?

Oh also we're supposed to call eachother and talk about it today, I'll update you"
relationship_advice,"Boyfriend tried to break up with me the other day. It was completely unexpected everything was fine up until that point, he was even talking about our future together the day before. I’m just confused about his actions","So after he broke up with me, we talked it out and everything’s back to the way it was before. I’m just wondering if this would be a form of manipulation? The breakup had nothing to do with me supposedly, and when I told him I still loved him and really wanted our relationship to work, things were fine again. My friends say he probably did this because he felt insecure and had to confirm my feelings for him. I just feel like there’s better ways to do that though. He’s done this before too, just saying he doesn’t feel like he can do this anymore, completely out of the blue and the second I start saying I love him and want a future together he ends up being fine again. It’s stressful to me because I now never know when he might do this to me again and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him to prevent that."
relationship_advice,Boyfriend troubles because of lack of effort - need advice,"Hi All,
Im having a battle with myself at the moment in my relationship.. whether to stay or go, whether to hang in there and wait for things to change. I am not sure how to address my issues with him without causing a huge fight.

I have been with my boyfriend for four years.. Im 23 and he is 26 and we live together. I find that he spends a lot of his time gaming and when I ask him to help me with dinner or small things he acts like its a big deal for interrupting him and I feel like im prority second and makes me feel guilty for asking. For instance even on the weekend when he wakes up I ask him to go out and do something because its a nice day its like he makes me feel bad and guilty for interrupting his game time or he says he just wants to stay in etc but spends most of his time on his laptop or xbox. Its not just the gaming thats the issue though its I feel he never puts in any effort to us and its like It doesnt even matter if im there or not. I feel lonely in the relationship because I feel he doesnt spend any time with just me away from gaming - he will be on his phone or something. Today we went on a trip to sydney for an appt of mine today and he was just grumpy the whole time and blaming me for not knowing where to go and it just made me miserable. At the end of the year he wants me to move away from our home town due to his work but im feeling really anxious as Im already feeling really isolated in the relationship now and I feel like how can I move when Its not like we are a good team together now.. Im not sure how to fix this or if I even can.. how do you make someone put in effort towards you?  I dont want to break up with him because I care about him but its making me sad but then I fear if I do leave ill be even lonelier and thats worse.. Im not sure it sounds silly."
relationship_advice,In need of advice for opening up to people again and making friends,"This is my first post on here so imma just go all out in case someone can help me lol.

So in Jan 2019, a 6 year+ friendship I had was ended, I want to say mutually, because of how recklessly i handled things back then, but honestly as time progressed I realised that no, i fucked up and my friend wants to end things for good. 

I was a bad friend in many aspects but I always strove to be better and correct my mistakes. However, the past mistakes i made piled on each other i guess, and my friend couldn't let go of it(?).. I still don't understand it completely, I just remember being so emotional at the time because this person was, and i hate to be cheesy, every definition of the word 'soulmate' to me. I connected with this person so well because we had 99% similar interests and a similar personality. This was a friend that was going to be a life-long one. 

I contacted my friend in Dec 2019 to clarify my doubts a little, but my friend has clearly moved on and it literally brings me physical pain lol. They asked me to hang out with their other friends, i'm assuming because of pity, and when i went out, I just remember the fucking pain I felt because of the ""spark"" not being there anymore. How it was so difficult to talk to them, but when i did, it was as if nothing even happened. I still follow their instagram, and idk whether I should just cut off all contact or not. I still see their every post/story and I wanna say i'm happy to know that theyre doing well, but holy fuck does it hurt to see that they have moved on and I haven't, even after all this time.

It feels like a fucking breakup, even though i've never even been in a relationship before. It's not even about the loneliness I feel without them, it's how virtually everything reminds me of them. If I see a video game that's coming out, the first thought that comes to mind is how we would have been playing this game together if we were still friends. Like what the fuck do I even do at this point.

I'm about to enrol into a new school but I feel absolutely no motivation to make new friends because i know it'll end sooner or later. I don't know if i can even try to fix things between my friend and I, because there is no hope, they seem so closed off. I don't understand how they could just end things off when we've been friends for 6 years - i guess their other friends helped them forget about me. 


Sorry for the long ass read, I seriously don't know what to do, i'm planning on getting therapy if i'm gonna be honest. Maybe this is just my depression making things worse than it actually is? Fuck, if anyone can give some advice i'd be really thankful."

relationship_advice,How do I (24 M) cut myself off from my family?,"I’m going to be starting a job soon that will allow me to be independent for the first time in my life where I won’t have to rely on anyone else.

My family has been mentally, emotionally and physically abusive to me growing up to the point when I was 17, I had to be hospitalized due to being suicidal.  And just recently my brother called me a “worthless piece of shit” and a “waste of space” simply because I pointed out a lie that he told and he basically uninvited me from his wedding.  My parents refuse to stand up for me in this instance despite them acknowledging that my brother was in the wrong.

I’ve been wanting to finally leave but haven’t had the courage or funds to do it, but this can finally be a possibility in the next few weeks.  I basically want to ask what steps do I need to have to be fully independent and be able to cut myself off from my family?  Both socially and economically.  I know moving out would be the first step, but what about with insurance and phone service?"
relationship_advice,I feel obliged to give money I receive from the government to my parents but...,"My family (Me, my parents &amp; 5 siblings) moved to a new country about a year ago. Since we arrived my parents were getting financial help from the government to help us settle in. Now that the financial help stopped, my parents are struggling. We still have a roof over our house, and we have food on the table but I was told how we don't have money to buy every day things, and the food budget is very limited.

My situation is when I arrived to this new country with my family I was 18 and technically didn't file the paperwork to be citizen. I finally decided to file the paperwork and as a result the government is giving me financial assistance every month for the next 6 months or so. 

I feel the need to help out my parents but I'm 19 years old &amp; I'm getting drafted in the military in the next few months. The military salary for the next 3 years will be about 200$ per month. 

I will need the money to support myself during my military service, but I feel terrible not giving the money to help out my parents.

My question basically is, is it okay for me to be selfish in this particular situation?"
relationship_advice,Was cheated on (23M) after rekindling with ex (21F). Seems genuine and wants things to work.,"I'll try to keep this short. I recently moved back to a city with an ex that things had ended early with due to a move 3 years ago. We rekindled things, and after an incredibly abusive relationship before this, I had just finally allowed myself to completely trust her and get over my fears after 2 months of us hanging out almost every day, and 1 month of us dating. The literal day after I gave in to trusting her, she cheats on me due to a rumor from one of her friends that I had been hitting on her and possibly worse over messages when I was still with abusive ex. She met up with her ex, didnt talk to me much at all or even tell me what the issue was, and made out with him and allowed him to sleep over. I know for a fact no sex was involved for reasons I'd rather not explain, but that almost makes it worse as making out is about her equivalent. 

Shes been completely honest with me since then, which is the only reason I'm debating fixing things at all, but I haven't come to a conclusion yet. Shes owned up to everything, and has told me things about the situation that would probably be really hard for her to admit. 

Since then, shes also seemed legitimately remorseful, and has blocked the ex (Which was her own suggestion), has been physically touching me a lot (hugs and cuddling, which I enjoy because I need it while sad but also feel weird about while its her), and she even sang me a song and was obviously incredibly nervous to sing it to me but did it anyway. Shes made in my opinion a pretty decent effort to try and win me back. I'm not saying its enough yet, but should I give her the chance to keep trying? I really do care about this girl, and shes gotten me through a lot of hard times, including some of the time I lived with abusive ex, and helping me quit my alcohol addiction after moving away from that situation. With the effort she's put in so far, theres no doubt in my mind that she is genuine and regrets her mistake (Which is a huge departure from abusive ex). Given my past though, and having been burned the day after I gave up my fears I'm just not sure its worth it. Any advice is appreciated!"

relationship_advice,Roommate does things with his girlfriend in the room and it's making me uncomfortable,"I live with two roommates in a small dorm room. Some time ago, my roommate started dating a girl, and since then she has been coming a lot into the room. The problem is that them doing romantic things when i'm around is making me really uncomfortable. It feels like I have a fourth roommate I haven't asked for. Sometimes they watch a movie and cuddle, while I have to put headphones and try to ignore them. Sometimes he would clear us out of the room to have sex with her. Sometimes they would sleep together and stay up talking until late so I can't sleep. Tonight was the last straw. They had sex right above me (we have a bunk bed).  I'm not sure if they knew I was awake but I think they didn't care. I was very uncomfortable and couldn't fall asleep for the whole time. Anyways I want to confront him but i'm unsure on where to draw the line. While I have my rights, I understand that he has nowhere to go and wants to do things with his girlfriend. What do you think is acceptable and unacceptable in these situations?"
relationship_advice,"I’m conflicted about a recent date with someone (22m, 22f)","Three weeks ago matched with a girl on tinder, we were talking and she was really nice. 
I picked her up last week, we got coffee then went back to my place and slept together. 
Then couple days later she stopped talking less and less and she didn’t reply for a day. (This week)
Day two of not talking our snap streak went, I’m not a clingy person so I didn’t text to see what’s up. 
I figured that she was done with me, and cause I didn’t get a text from her ending anything, or not just wanting to be friends I decided to remove her from socials, I’m used to nsa situations and I presumed that was that.
Day after she hit me up on insta; asking why I deleted her, I told her I presumed she was done with me, and not to worry about it.
But she explained that she wasn’t feeling good and didn’t feel like talking to anyone and thought it was rude that I deleted her. 
I told her I had nothing else to say and to take care of herself, she never replied. But I feel guilty now as I feel like an asshole.
I sent another message today (2 days later) explaining how it made me feel like shit, I was annoyed that she never told me or let me know what was going on, I felt like shit cause out of nowhere she stopped talking and I felt used. 
I now regret deleting, and if I just waited an extra day or two we could still probably be talking now.
I have an issue where I like people really quickly, but I don’t let them know cause I know it’d scare them away. 
I feel like an idiot and I wish I never did it. 
I don’t think she’s going to respond, I don’t think it would be ever worked out and I’m upset about that.

relationship_advice,Should I be worried if my boyfriend has asked me for an open relationship? (Several times),"So my boyfriend of one year and I live in different continents and only get to visit each other every 3-5 months. A few months ago he brought up the idea of an open relationship as something we could try. I said that it was something I had no interest in at all and we had a small argument over it. But it was resolved.
Then a few months later he brought up the same topic, of having an open relationship again. I was angry with him that he would ask me again, as he knew full well how I felt about it. He said that sex is a meaningless thing for him and he doesn’t understand why I’m getting so upset for. He complained that he very rarely gets to have sex because of the long distance between us. 
More recently, we were discussing new things we would like to try out in the bedroom. He asked how I felt about threesomes and I said that it would not be something o would want to be part of, as sex for me is a very intimate and meaningful thing that I only want to do with the person I love. Once again, he got super defensive and we argued.

Have I done anything up till now? During our arguments about this he seems to not get what I’m saying at all. I really don’t want to end this relationship because I love him so much. This is the only issue that we have argued about in the past, but it is recurring. He says that he only wanted to try an open relationship because of the long distance and not getting to see each other very often. I feel like he’s really pushing this and I don’t feel comfortable. Am I being closed minded for saying no?"
relationship_advice,"Friend/love interest is asexual, I'm bi, conflict ensues","my best friend, companion, and love interest is asexual, i adore her, and she likes me, but it's difficult for her, she doesn't really want to sleep with me and that's OK but she often feels like she's holding me back. I try to be considerate as she had a very sheltered youth and hasn't really had any intimate relationships with anyone else but we've known each other several years and i can't even get her to hold my hand, she told me she loves me for the first time ever a few weeks ago and it seemed like she was in pain, I don't want to feel like I'm pushing her too far every time i get close to her, I feel like I'm hurting her, I recently moved but am planning on coming back soon, though I've been thinking with the relationship growing ever more distant now might be the easiest time for her to accept a clean breakup. I love her so much she's my dearest friend and i'd be fine abstaining from sex forever if it made her happy but i can't stand the feeling that even simple demonstrations of affection are making her uncomfortable, I feel like a jerk, like i'm pressuring her into doing something she doesn't want and she just doesn't want to disappoint me, I feel like I'm imposing my feelings onto her and she deserves better than that, I love her and i want what's best for her even if it's not me and she just doesn't realize that. Also of note is that I have a history of self-destructive behavior and impulsive self-loathing, I've had suicidal thoughts in the past and I need to be able to convey my feelings in a way that doesn't make her fear for my safety.

relationship_advice,"Major crossroad in life, stay or go","okey, i'm gonna try to keep it as short as i can so i don't bore you to death. But i really need your help.
growing up i've always been told by my parents that i shouldn't do things because i won't make it. i should play it safe. in school i wouldn't try hard because i felt like i wouldn't get it anyway. i got picked on and had my teeth punched out in fourth grade, but i didn't tell anyone about the bullying because i didn't want anyone to get in trouble. pretty sure my parents where gonna get a divorce, atleast i was hoping they would because of all the fighting. but nah, they pushed through. i didn't know much other than rejection from boys, and i didn't dare tell anyone i was bi. being short and ugly was enough.i moved out at 15 because it became to much and my parent were fucking toxic.
age 15-17 i got in a relationship that messed me up good.
physical and mental abuse, rape, kidnapping.. i ran away and did not tell anyone what actually happened because i was to scared of the consequences. struggled with depression for the most of my life, self harmed for years before anyone found out. moved to a different town, bad relationships continued, seeing a shrink didn't help that much. jumped from relationship to relationship, learing along the way my actual self worth. there is so much more shit but you get the drift. stopped self harming, still get some urge sometime but not so much. 22years old, was gonna move south away from this but ofcourse i found someone. and to be honest, it's been so stable and good that i almost couldn't take it at first. but i grew into it. i thought: i need this. i need stability.
he was in the process of building his own house which he's been including me very much in the process. we moved in together very quickly even tho we're very different people. got a dog, and still going for over a year. i also started in therapy again, which has really helped now that i'm ready for it. i know what i deserve, but still go out of my way to please and help people that give little to nothing back. i have like 2 friends that i can talk to which is really nice. they live far away tho.
the relationship is not something i'm used to. it's his first relationship ever, at 27 years old.
i'm used to amazing sex and being super open minded. but just the thought of using handcuffs stresses him out. trust me, i've tried everything over the last 1,5 years, i just doesn't want to do those kind of things. this frustrates me and i find myself thinking what if. i've got a lot of issues and i'm very aware they are a handful for him, especially when he doesn't know the slightest about communication or feelings. he has been raised with a silverspoon in this mouth. i love to travel, do things, being spontaneous, talk about philosophy, being romantic, buying him stuff, have great sex.. these are the things that are left out. he would rather watch anime or a movie, relax. i just know that a future with him would be safe and secure. he would make a great dad.
i truly love him and he's the best thing that has happened to me. but i'm back in this god awful town i grew up in, feeling so restricted. 
i dont have a community here, i have no clue what to do career wise. i'm frustrated over the sex part. i try to communicate this to him but i can just see it in his eyes that he gets so hurt because he doesn't do it on purpose, he just doesn't know how. and it ends up being an evil circle of him getting insecure, and things not ""working"".. which i have reassured him multiple times that it's completely normal and nothing to worry about. but as a guy, you know how it feels..he's truly happy with just plain intercourse, where i on the other hand love to play really rough. i don't wanna hurt him or make him feel bad because of my need for release, but that's what i have been relying on since i stopped self harming. 
this is where i really need your help.
i'm at a crossroad now.
i'm so invested with the house, and the dog.
something inside me just wanna go. move to the capital, go to gay bars, find a job that i actually like, find people that actually share some of my interests, go to all female or both sexparties(!?) and become the best version of myself that i can be. 
but i have no savings, and i really do love him..
what do i do??
I usually can track my emotion and reactions back to my trauma, but with being manic and depressed for so many years, your mind can play tricks on you. Am i scared of staying, scared of the commitment, or scared of taking a chance.
Like, what's the difference between being selfish or being self caring. I don't know. 

if you actually took your time to read this, and reply.. i'm grateful with all my heart, truly!!!

relationship_advice,My [30m] girlfriend [27f] doesn't want me to pick her up when she gets back from overseas,"Fair warning, this is going to sound rather petulant. I'm fully aware of that and that's why I'm posting here, to find a way to stop fretting about it.

Relevant information: 1) we've been dating for eleven months 2) we don't live together 3) the relationship has its ups and downs, but I daresay it's pretty stable and we're happy.

So the deal's pretty much what it says in the title. Girlfriend's been doing a spot of traveling over the last couple of weeks. She's coming back tomorrow, and I offered to pick her up at the airport, but she refused and said she'd find her own way home, which is more or less in keeping with her headstrong, independent nature.

Now obviously this should be perfectly fine, but it's still eating away at the back of my head. I offered to meet her at the airport because I haven't seen her in weeks and I miss her and I thought it'd be a nice thing to do, to welcome her home, sort of. But she's refused, and now there's a little voice in the back of my head that keeps asking why she doesn't want to see me.

How do I deal and get over myself?"

Recently I found out that my partner wants me to dominate and I said that's fine but I will think before deciding properly which they were cool with.
You see, being a Dom makes me feel really uncomfortable since I'm a people pleaser and basically a sub sexually or not. I really want to make my partner happy by dominating her but we tried once and I felt a sick kind of uncomfortable while not cumming. 

I just want to make my partner happy and comfortable with the consequence being me always uncomfortable and dreading having sex. I'm already avoiding sex now and I don't want to do it any longer.

relationship_advice,I (26F) recently suffered a loss and I feel neglected by my close friend (25F). How to handle it ?,"Hi Reddit,

I have quite a long history of miscommunication and issues with a close friend so I'll try to stick to the essential here.

So I'm friend with her since 2015, we're part of a group of friends who share the same interests and we met online. At the beginning we had a really good relationship, lots of love and fun between us and I felt really secure around her. Three years ago, I moved into her apartment she shared with another girl, because I needed to relocate for a new job. Everything was alright but when we started living together without the third girl, things started to slowly crumble between us. 

Long story short, I decided to leave the apartment and gave a year notice (basically I told her in January and the lease ended December first). I had a talk with her in November, where I asked how she sees our relation, if she still wants to be friends and if everything is OK between us (I made my peace by learning that some people are good friends but bad roommates, or at least incompatible roommates). She said that, for her, everything was OK and there is no reason not to see each other anymore. We spent time together since, celebrated New Year's eve with our friends, spoke to each other, it seemed OK.

Two weeks ago, on Friday, my old cat (15 years) who lived with us in our old apartment fell sick. By the time I was at my mom's with my cat because of issues in my new apartment. It was a crushing news for me. I love my cat dearly, she was with me most of my life and helped me go through some traumas in my younger years. She was the sweetest, always sleeping with me and purring and giving good vibes to anyone who approached her.

I told my friend about it on Friday night. I felt like she had to be the first one to know, because she shared two years with the cat and cared about her a lot. I got one concerned message about how my cat was, I answered her, and that was it. On Saturday I sent her some messages to keep her updated, in which I told her the bad situation. She sent me emojis and gifs, telling me to be brave and that she sent me love. 

Later on, I sent some messages to express my feelings and how I was lonely and sad and anxious (my cat was at the vet for perfusion). I got no answer. On Sunday, i got nothing. I sent a message Monday morning telling I needed to talk, and nothing. On Monday night, she asked me how she was. I told her that it was the end, that Tuesday we'll had to put an end to it. She sent me a hug message. Then I sent a last message saying that it was done and awful, and then I got nothing more.

Lucky for me I have other friends, who called me, took me to their homes, gave me love and support (and fed me french fries). But I feel she wasn't there at all, she just answered with the minima as when you don't know what to say and don't wanna be involved. I noticed later on Twitter that, in fact, she spent her whole weekend and Monday playing online games with friends and that's why she didn't answer me.

It's been a week and half since. She suddenly sent me a message on Wednesday to ask me how I was, and to say she was sorry for the silence but she was sick. For info, she keeps track of her life on Twitter so I went to read what happened to her, and saw she went to the ER the night before because of sudden brutal headaches (turns out she has a sinusitis). The other tweets mentioned a classic work-eat-sleep routine. 

I know, and I keep repeating it myself, that she doesn't owe me time or love or support and I shouldn't be resentful and angry about her behavior. But I can't help it, I feel neglected, abandoned. I needed her, sincerely, with my heart. I felt I needed HER support, and she didn't give it to me. It seriously hurt all these days, waiting for news from my Vet, going to see my cat alone, seeing her sick and dying, knowing I had to take a decision, and all that time I was waiting for an answer from my friend, I couldn't have been clearer about my needs and she decided that either I wasn't worth it, or it was too awkward for her.

Know I don't know what to do. I feel like an asshole for not answering her, but I don't have the heart to speak to her. I'm completely lost because my feelings seem to be clearly wrong but I don't know how to handle them. Yesterday I saw her Christmas card with *""In my next life I wish I'll meet you sooner""* on it and she wrote *""This card represents my love for you""* and started to cry like it was a huge lie and it really hurts (in addition to sobbing every time my eyes meet the sofa were my cat used to sleep, my life is pretty great right now !).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My old friend didn't give me the support I needed and asked while I was mourning and now I don't wanna talk to her but I feel I'm in the wrong here. How to handle it ?"
relationship_advice,Friends want to buy a valentines gift for his ex,"Hey Redditors, 

A friend of mine is having a hard time getting over a girl who eventually broke his heart, has a new boyfriend and apparently moved on.

Now he is asking me if he should get here a Valentine’s Day to show he still cares and I strongly advices him no to do that.

Do you guys support my advice, I think he needs to hear it from a majority."
relationship_advice,Can anyone give me advice on what to do in this situation with my boyfriend?,"I posted earlier about my (F30) relationship with my boyfriend (M40). In short, we have been seeing each other for four years, but he lied to me in the past, cheated on his pregnant partner with me while telling me he had broken up with her, and I had no idea she was pregnant and was completely devastated and cut all contact with him. But eventually he convinced me that they’re truly separated and we started seeing each other again. Right now they appear to have truly broken up and he has convinced me it’s real, but my trust issues make it impossible for me to find any peace of mind. His mother has recently been diagnosed with cancer and has only a few weeks left to live, so whenever I start to challenge or question whether he’s telling me the truth (which happens almost daily) he says I’m not supportive and that I’m basically a bad person to be “stressing him” at a time when he’s going through hell. But I just want to know for certain he is telling the truth this time. Whenever I say I’m going to ask his ex to confirm it’s real, he gets snappy and says I’m being selfish and unsupportive at such a difficult time for him. He has said he loves me and wants to marry me, I lost my virginity to him and I love him deeply despite everything, that is why it has been so hard to walk away even after all his lies. What can I do? Is it wrong of me to challenge or question him when he’s going through such a hard time? Am I wrong to want to talk to his ex to make sure it’s all true? Can anyone give me any advice on this slightly absurd and painful relationship? I just want to be happy and for things to be simple. But they’re not."
relationship_advice,"I'm starving, my husband's overweight","Hey, so a little bit of backstory here. My husband and I are really ridiculously tight on money; we're definitely living pay check to paycheck and I manage all the finances. I am currently 5'5"" and 110 lbs, and my husband is 5'11"" and 230 lbs. In the past couple years I've lost 25 lbs and he's gained 50 lbs. Our financial situation probably isn't going to get much better until I'm done with school in two years and then I'm pretty confident we'll be ok after that.

My husband is definitely a stress eater, and we have a very tight set budget for food. He has very little control when it comes to his impulse eating and when he eats more I eat less so that we don't dip into money meant for other bills. The majority of the weight I've lost has been in the last 4 months and my weight has just been dropping very rapidly. I'm at a point right now where I eat 1 can of spaghettios a day and that's it. I've taken his card (which he was fine with) but he genuinely believes he is starving when I limit his food and gets very upset, so I usually end up caving.

My husband loves me, I love him, I just don't know what to do here..."

She says she loves me and will never love anyone else, but the world is bigger than us and she still has a lot to see, discover and experience. I've been waiting to come together for 2,5 years now. I saw her as the person who I would like to spend my life with (she also says the same about me). She is a vagabond, all over the globe, and I am a working semi-settled expat person, unable to move. I can't really follow her since she became fully alternative max. 1 week future plan person, and moving from country to country continuously. Both beginning of 30's. She doesn't want to live in the country I'm living, so she is pursuing her travels while ""waiting"" until I finish my work (approx. 2 years) and join her travels and world discoveries, I actually don't even know what that means. She is the most amazing woman I ever met, and I have serious doubts that I'll find anything like her. Yet, my self confidence is destroyed in years. I have never been that suicidal. I think I'm in love with some image of my absent girlfriend, and everything became superficial. Despite its hardness, I tried to break up many times, but she insists on being ""together"" and keeps on talking about common future dreams that can be realized in 10 years.

I'd love to hear your stories as well, if any,

relationship_advice,I(M) am open to experimenting but I'm afraid my girlfriend will think less of me.,"I'm a straight guy, my girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and we've always been very sexually open.
We've explored fantasies, boundaries, and even delved into some of her bisexual tendencies. It's always been a very positive experience as we are both very open and sex positive.

Recently I've found myself wanting to try some light experimenting with a guy (no one in particular). I'm not really into men, I just don't have anything against it and think it'd be an interesting experience (with certain boundaries).
I'm very comfortable with my own sexuality and don't feel my partner would be upset about the thoughts I've been having.
The furthest I think I'd go is oral but I'm afraid that despite my own confidence, it might seriously affect the way my girlfriend sees me.
I'm a pretty masculine dude and I know my girlfriend really enjoys that aspect of me.

I met this guy early on at my college, it’s a very small school so you pretty much see the same faces every day. At the start of the year we would hang out a lot and we became friends. There were a few red flags that popped up and made realize that continuing to be his friend is unhealthy for me. It is his first year in college, so I feel like he relies on me and has become dependent on me for his social life. I am comfortable with being introverted and have made other friends that I like to hang out with that are in my classes. We used to hang out all the time but I feel like I have moved on, especially since we didn’t talk at all over Christmas break. I see him at school a lot and I don’t have any need to approach him. I feel bad because he has seen me with  my other friends, and I feel bad it hurts his feelings that he thinks he is being replaced. This kid seems a little emotionally unstable and sensitive. The awkwardness is killing me, every time I see him. He keeps asking me to hang out and I don’t want to. I’m not busy, I just don’t want him in my life because of some other flags. Any advice on how to keep living my life without the thought of having to make plans with him eat me alive. Thanks for reading.

relationship_advice,My [29M] ex [28F] is social media stalking me and I feel sad for her,"We broke up some months ago, but have met and had sex for months after. I realized I don't have strong feelings for her, but she does for me. I should have been more strict, and said no-communication in the beginning for her sake, but I'm weak and everytime she hurts, I hurt and want to comfort her.

She broke communication three weeks ago, but I see her stalking my instagram stories, and that makes me sad. I know that pain, I've been there, and it makes me sad she is going through it. It kills me that I can't do anything, but do you knownif there is a way?

Or am I just doing this selfishly to just ease my pain, and I should just let her go through this pain so she can move on?

Ps. This doesn't mean I have strong feelings for her, as many assume when they hear this. Do people just give no fucks to their ex when they know they are hurting?"
relationship_advice,already ruined birthday and it's only 9am.,"today is my \[22F\] 22nd birthday. my boyfriend \[21M\] came last night.   


he promised me he would be a better boyfriend on my birthday and treat me like an actual girlfriend. he told me he'd get me flowers etc to apologise. it's not the gifts i care about.   
he didn't show up with gifts, didn't hug me or acknowledge my existence just kept trying to avoid me the entire drive to the hotel.  


last week he asked me what i wanted to do for my birthday and i said dinner and bowling. he booked an Indian restaurant. i hate indian food he knows that. he also is ""too tired"" and ""too annoyed"" to go bowling. won't tell me what he's annoyed about.  


there are 3 beds in our hotel room. (idk why) 1 double bed for us to sleep, and 2 single beds on either side of the room. last night i went in the double bed and was waiting for him to come to bed like normal, he slept the entire night in one of the single beds and i was by myself. he's never slept by himself before when he sleeps with me. it's weird and i'm pissed off about it.  


he kept saying how annoying i was last night and that the 3 hour drive wasn't worth it. i'm gonna talk to him face to face today and tell him why i'm upset. i'm also not excited for the rest of my birthday. i've hated my birthday for 3 years from ex boyfriends being ass holes this year is no different. i'm going to tell him if he doesn't grow up, respect other people, and acknowledge our relationship then i'm dumping him. how do i approach this gently?"

relationship_advice,Giving advice to my girlfriend,"My girlfriend is 7 years younger than myself, which isnt a problem until it comes to stressful situations in life.

Whenever a stressful situation comes up, because I'm empathetic and care about her, I instinctively want to give her advice. I either suggest a course of action or advise her on a different perspective. 

She hates this. She assumes I think shes immature and due to our age difference, believes I'm trying to give her life lessons as I'm older. Shes also somewhat over sensitive and assumes the worst in any sentence that can be construde in a negative manner. Often times I say something off the cuff, with no direct correlation to her, and she gets offended by it.

How can I help her with random life struggles without putting her off and how can I get her to stop being so insecure about things that I myself, and other people  say to her?

It's hard for me to just sit back and listen to her problems without trying to give advice about how to fix them...I feel like I'm a useless partner if I do this."
relationship_advice,If she is opening up to me does it mean she is giving me another chance?,"So me and this girl had a huge fight. We were really close at one point but have been on and off friends for about a year. She blocked me after the argument. I broke trust as well. I then sent her an email, basically an apology letter. I poured all my feelings into it and told her about myself because I find it hard to be open. I'm quite a private person. I told her I would never speak to her again.


But surprisingly she decided to unblock me and added me back on snap. Was asking to talk about it. I mean at the same time she was upset, having a mental breakdown. She was sassing me to block her by saying ""I bet blocking me would make you feel better since poor you is going through so much"". I didn't of course. She was just being emotional and I guess testing me? Anyways It's been a week since I've spoken to her and she still hasn't blocked me. Does it mean she is giving me another chance? Why did she add me back when all the answers were in that letter?"
relationship_advice,"Need help, advice. Apologies for how long it is.","Ever since me and my gf started dating we've always had different standards to different things. Been with her a year and a half and she's basically still the same person before but with hair dye. I've been trying to get her to work, help her with applications, interviews, but when she gets them she either doesn't go to interview. Or if she lands the job she only stays a week to a month only and every time she leaves it's this super dramatic bs about whatever. She's had 3 jobs last year and only been at each 2 weeks to a month. Leaving me to be the main income for everything. At the time last year I was making about $2,000 a month. But it required 10+ hour days 5-6 days a week. So yeah. And I'm also a very clean person. I hate clutter all on the floor, clothes, trash, etc. And since I worked such long hours I did not really have the energy to do so after my shift or the next day if I had something to do before work. She's 27 years old and I've always told her and asked her for help. To maintain our household, clean, be productive and try to do something. My grandparents always said in life to never get complacent and lazy. But alas for the entirety of the relationship im the one who worked daily, cleaned out room, kitchen, did laundry, dishes, had to cook my own meals after a long shift which annoyed me a bit cause she'd make her own food but not for me. Sometimes she takes the money I earned and just spends it. Whether it be a bill, or anything but just doesn't tell me . The relationship as a whole is hard sometimes. And it doesn't help all my family doesn't like her, constantly tells me to get rid of her, I can find better. And in total it's completely ruined my mental state to the point where even when I have off from work I can't relax, gotta clean, and deal with all the other crap. I'm not trying to paint her In a bad way but I wanna be honest. And I love her. So much. Her mind, her energy, her sex, etc. But I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be able to keep moving on trying to do everything I want to do in life while working a 10+ hour job, cleaning, being the one to pay all the bills, cook for us most times. I've told her all this before. Made like chore lists so she can help, talked to her about things constantly and etc. But it hurts and frustrates me when I can't sleep due to clutter, stepping on random things on the floor that cut me sometimes, working and everything. And to top it off I'm like the only person in her life that does so much for her. Her family wrote her off a few years ago completely. Idk fully why. But the thing that hurts me the most is I don't feel appreciated. I barely get told thank you when I do some or all the things I do. I don't want to be rewarded or something but just appreciated. It cuts me inside when she yells at me, or is just rude to me for no reason when I don't wanna buy her something or whatever.  And I don't wanna just dump her cause I know she used to be suicidal. But this relationship is starting to affect me so much mentally and emotionally and everything going on. Idk how much longer I'll be able to do it before I crack, break it off, or something. What should I do? Ultimatum, talk to her some more, cause honestly idk at this point."
relationship_advice,My(20f) ex boyfriend(24m) has begun threatening me via text. I’m scared of escalation happening.,"https://imgur.com/gallery/q6N4W0p

TL;DR Emotionally unstable ex boyfriend has begun sending me threatening text messages. I’m scared of what may happen in the future. 

My ex boyfriend Chris and I dated for maybe a month, I was trying to get over my last relationship, I rebounded hard with Tinder matches and found someone I did like at the time. I was very upfront and honest with him that a relationship while the thought is nice, I’m not emotionally or mentally ready for one. 

I still love my previous ex boyfriend, Nate, Nate and I also have to work together. It was easy until I went to work and had to see him after being away for 2 months. 

I didn’t want to lead Chris on so I ended our relationship, I was going to leave either way as I noticed he would blow up often at friends or me for a bunch of things. 

I said we could try and be friends to keep everything calm but he freaked out, threatened suicide and threatened to overdose. 

Followed by many texts and phone calls I ignored later he left me alone for two weeks before sending me threatening texts not long ago as I’m typing this. 

He knows where I work and where I live. I’m scared of him coming to my job or to my house. If I was at work I’d be safe as I’m surrounded by supportive coworkers who would help me. I’m worried for my family more than anything. 

I avoided telling them about the relationship but they do know of Chris and where he lives and that he and I were friends. I work 2nd shift but I work the entire day and I’m becoming more anxious the more I think about things. 

I don’t want to lose my job over this failed relationship, I don’t want my family hurt. I’m scared a restraining order wouldn’t do much to deter him from doing something."
relationship_advice,Did my fiance do something wrong?,"Hi
So, yesterday I (20f) went to my fiance's (25M) phone because I wanted some of our pictures together...my phone camera doesn't have the best quality and his birthday is coming up in two weeks..so I was in the gallery and got some photos into my phone, and then for some reason it clicked in my head to see the trash or whatever that's called (I'm sorry for my English. It's not my mother language). What I saw was this one single picture of a girl in a bikini, very beautiful and attractive... which is basically the opposite of me. I was really shocked because I've known this man for so many years and I never ever imagined him doing something like this? To be very honest the picture wasn't even provocative, it was just a girl in a bikini smiling to the camera, nothing special..
Stalker me obviously already knows who she is and where that picture was taken from and when..I got relieved for she being a random girl because atm I thought ""maybe an ex?""...but it's just a random girl.
I confronted him about it soon after, and he said he deleted it as soon as he transfered it because he knew he was acting stupid..
I really want to trust him again, but I'm so so so insecure and trusting people takes so long and I'm scared I'll always remember this and I can't forget it/forgive it, making what we had impossible to bare.
Maybe for some of you this is nothing but for me it was a huge problem..
I'm trying to forget it but I keep on blaming myself for this, because I look nothing like her.. I have brown eyes and brown hair, she has blue eyes and blonde hair. I am potato and she's super skinny.
I really could use different points of view, I just want to be able to forget this."
relationship_advice,Confused,"I'm honestly not even 100% sure I want to stay in this relationship anymore. My relationship with my partner for two years that is. Me = (24M) Her: (26F).
We've been dating since April 2018 but haven't made it official. And make 2 years this April. It's been nice and all but I'm noticing myself just being extremely nonchalant about a lot of things. Like it's pretty much ""yeah we're dating. Been dating for almost 2 years."" And just kinda leave it at that. Now don't get me wrong, she's not a bad person. She's helped me with getting my shit straight like pushing me to get a second job when my first wasn't paying all the bills, teaching me about credit and how I've been fucking myself up, standing up for myself since I struggle with boundaries, etc. That being said, we have had a lot of bad fights. Hasn't happened in a while so that's good. But yeah the drive isn't really there. And I feel awful for even considering that I want to leave because she's helped me out and me leaving would leave her with our apartment by herself. (She had the apartment with ex, ex left, she held it down for a while then I moved in after 8 months of dating)
What's the best way to process these thoughts?
Should I stay? Should I go? Should I wait it out?
Any constructive advice will be extremely appreciated."

relationship_advice,"Issues with a friends partner, is she (28) being unreasonable?","Sorry in advance for formatting and length. 
So me (F, 24) and my best friend (M,24) have known eachother for 16 years, grew up together. Lets call him ""F"".
We've stuck by eachother and are very much like siblings. About four years ago he got involved with a woman (28) who seemed awesome, let's call her ""M"". I made a real effort to be her friend too, as did she. It was going well to begin with but for the past year, its been really weird. She's been talking shit about me behind my back to another person, she's trying to stop my best friend and I from hanging out, she apparently brings me up a lot during arguments when its unprompted, she's nice to me one minute but cold the next. During all of this I've still remained friendly towards her for the sake of my friendship with F. At new years she sent me a message apologising for everything, saying she wants to hang out again etc so I made the effort, went over to their house and met her best friend (M, 30) who I hadn't previously met. It was an awesome night, seemed to go well. The next week her friend invited me to the pub with a group because we live in the same small town and turns out we only live 15 minutes away, it's local so I agreed, great night, very chill they said they really enjoyed my company. Well M lost her shit about it when she found out they invited me and since is doing everything in her power to stop me and my best friend F from hanging out. I get she's insecure. My friend group are mostly guys, half of them have asked me out at some point or another (relevant) F hasn't because we're like siblings but she seems to see me as a threat anyways regardless of the fact that I've been honest with her every step of the way and she knows that. She's admitted to me that she's ""intimidated"" by me and I asked what I could do to alleviate that (this was prior to my going to the pub with her friends) . 
I'm at a point that Im kind of sick of trying my best to prove to her I'm a decent human being, I'm sick of her acting like it's a crime for me to associate with people she knows. I'm sick of her holding it against me or acting like it reflects poorly on me that when my friend group and I were teenagers some of them asked me out (I'm not friends with most of them anymore but I still go to social gatherings because of the ones I am still friends with). 

I dont know what to do anymore, I'm not going to stop talking to my best friend, period. I have spoken to him and it's clear he's being put in a really shitty position so I don't want to make him feel worse about it. Normally I would be civil but at this point, having to witness her tantrums over me just existing is annoying and I don't have the energy for it anymore and a lot of the time I'm hypervigelent of what I'm saying or doing so she won't judge me over it. Hell I'm at a point of questioning whether I have done something wrong and if she's in the right for her actions. What can I do to make the situation easier?"

Then i said, ""go if that's what you want but I'll wait for you, come back only when you realised how much you damaged me."" She said, ""i promise I'll never come back and you're a loser, psychopath, crazy"" stuff like that and then blocked me and left. That was the end of it.

In 2nd link, i told people i didn't respond for new year. But actually i did. Only this three words ""Happy new year"".  

After that, until today, she hasn't contacted me. But she's in HK. My head is going crazy and **want to text asking if she's okay** and tell her to take preventive measures. But I'm also confused whether i should! I don't want anything happen to her, I'd be devastated if she got the virus! I don't even know if it's right to feel this way towards the abuser!

I've been together with my girlfriend for about 7 years now but we just recently (mid 2019) moved in together and have been very happy since then. We are both in our late 20s and have had times - about 4 of our 7 years together - when we lived in separate countries and were seeing each other once or twice a month. 

My GFs situation right now: Doing a PhD and she has another 1,5 years left at least if she continues working on it. However, she is very unhappy with her team and work currently and she got offered though a job in another country (1 hour flight from where we are now) that pays good, will give her much better opportunities and since she is not happy with her PhD at the moment she is seriously considering this option. Of course she will have to move and we will have to adjust to this situation but she \*might\* be able to visit once a month for a week (though she will only know about this in case she takes that jobs and discusses with the new team).

My situation: stable job which I like (I've been in a pretty awful job before that and since I changed jobs 1 year ago and I couldn't be more satisfie now) and I will most likely have the option to work remotely from another country and having to be in the actual office about once or two times a month. I am happy with my life currently and if I move with my girlfriend, it will be tough to have a network and friends since I will be working mostly from home. I will also have to spend more money to travel back and forth to my office once/twice a month and I am not keen to move to a small city where I will not speak the language and begin from scratch.

  
Do I think too close-minded? What would you do? I don't want my girlfriend to leave this opportunity because of me but since we have been living together, we have both been very happy with our situation and keeping a long-distance relationship for at least the next 5 years makes it hard for us to plan family/life etc. On the other hand, I feel like I need to think of myself as well and I'm not ready yet to move (again) and start an almost new life. 

Any tips will be appreciated!"
relationship_advice,Why do I (23f) get so stressed out and upset over little things my bf (21m) does or more so doesn't do.,"My boyfriend is a little messy and often forgets to do things I have asked him to do. Every so often when he doesn't do one of the things I've asked him, usually when he promises before had that he will do it, I have like a complete emotional breakdown. These episodes are completely out of my control and I usually need a really long solo shower to calm myself and get the crying under control.

So my question is, how do I stop this from happening, are there steps I can take to stop myself from over reacting to this kinds of situations, does anyone else experience these uncontrollable emotional outbursts?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."
relationship_advice,Someone Tried To Lure My (19F) Friend (19F) Into A Cult/Sex Trafficking? ? I Can't Move On.,"My dear friend L means the whole world to me. We've been friends for six years now and the bond we share is precious. She's a sister to me without a doubt. Now, our conversation took place on January 8th, 2020 according to our DMs on Instagram. I was very shocked and upset when L told me what happened to her the day before (January 7th). I'm going to copy and paste what she told me below. 

&amp;#x200B;

L : ok before u start screaming when i tell u this, i assure u. i am ok. i am well and nothing severely bad has happened to me. so. basically there has been sex trafficking going around and i got approached by one today. so i will explain my story. so me and my mom went out to get a few errands. so like we went to mcdonalds and my mom ordered my food for me and after she did the plan was for her to find her stuff after she ordered for me to make other things quicker. she was buying clothes for her work party. then we had to buy coke boxes for home ( which is heavy to bring ) so when i was waiting for my food the lady who took my order gave a really sad smile and told me how i was really lucky to have my mother. so i gave a smile back and told her yes. then she proceeds to tell me how she doesn't have her mother in her life and she passed away at such a young age. i felt so sad. i wanted to say a lot of things. but u know that ain't really my place to say and people can get offended- all i can ever say is just sorry for your loss. what i really wanted to say to her, that, shes watching over you for sure. shes thinking about you right now. God did this so it is a blessing for you to know that your mother is always around you. it's just sad man.. i know i grew up with people usually telling me stuff like this because i have both of my parents or i have a luxury of having so many things and it just makes me feel guilty.. u know? so i just got my food after and sat where my mom told me to eat because we would meet up there after. i was having a good time u know? so this lady went up to me. a korean lady. she looked like a regular student.. which scares me even more. so she told me that she wanted people's opinion on her presentation and i was chewing my food and laughing because it took me back and she was laughing too and told me to take my time. And i nodded and told her to go ahead as i swallowed my food. then here's what triggered my fight or flight. she said she was doing her presentation about god the mother. so the reason why this triggered my fight or flight is because this has been a method, rumored, to be a method for sex trafficking. it has been all over my twitter feed and now that has happened to me i got scared. so i tried my best to keep my cool. and just told her to keep going. so then she asked me how old i was and what school i was in. and she laughed and told me that i looked younger than my age and i got that a lot, u know ? like a lot of my moms friends would tell me that i don't look like a college student. even my hairdresser told me that the other day when i got my hair done for layers. but the way she told me about that i looked younger than my age was just.. not it. so she asked me if i would be interested to go to bible study, i said i'd think about it because of my religion. (L is Catholic in case that matters) and obviously there was something wrong but obviously i did NOT say it out loud because she said she wanted help on her presentation not going to bible study. so she gave her number and i just pulled out my notes and just took it and she left. thank gosh she didn't know my name. i didn't tell any of my family members due to how protective they get. and from my research it hasn't been proven if this was actually a thing or not. better safe than sorry u know, for myself tbh. some people say it's a cult or the sex trafficking thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it with L's story. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in tears. I was shaking and I was pissed. One of the worst parts was knowing that the Korean lady that approached L looked like a regular college student. Just an ordinary looking person with twisted intentions. It can be anyone. As a young adult, one of the things that disgust me the most are people who abuse of their position/power in order to harm others. 

In my childhood, I was abused by my uncle who was (is still?) a pastor. I was molested (not raped) more than once by this monster. This pedophile took advantage of the fact that my father was never present in my life. My father was a deadbeat. This uncle was the closest thing I had to a father up until the abuse. When I confronted him in front of family, he faked tears and cried. Telling my aunts that he'd never do such a thing. They believed him. One of my aunts we'll call A (not the aunt married to the pedo), told my family that it was simply my imagination. But tell me, how does a child come up with such things? Especially when it happened more than one occasion? Gross. It's crazy cause I told A's daughter (we'll call B) about what happened she called pedo uncle a gross dirty old man. B is older than and told me he did the same thing to her when she was a child. So yeah, this man has abused more than one child with no punishment to this day. A lot of people know about my abuse in my family because some dumb bitch aunt called M (sorry but this part enrages me) thought it was her business to go off and tell others the story of my abuse. She told her ex husband who told me she told him and how could you just do that? That's personal shit yo. People in the family talked. Lies were spread. My mom has never addressed it/ spoken with me about my abuse but I can't even imagine how she must've felt as a single parent. There was so much my mom had gone through for my older brother and I. I didn't want to burden her more and mental health wasn't something talked upon in my family growing up. Crazy cause as a child, I knew what he did was wrong. But I was also confused. Child me instantly forgave him and I don't remember why. It was something adult me admires about child me. I forgave him and held no resentment/ hatred for him. Just hurt, awkwardness and confusion. Forgiving him did help me live many years of my life a bit more peacefully. I'm in a way better mental state now than I was in my earlier teenage years. But my abuse is something that I think about everyday...though I wish I didn't have to. I guess you can say that it's taking a toll on me now. Just the usual thoughts. Knowing that that pedophile is a free man because none of us victims came forward. Granted, we were children and this happened in another country (for me at least). I also wonder to myself everyday, what can I do to help other victims? My friend could've been a victim. I wish I could attempt some kind of vigilante justice for her but I'm just one person. There's only so much I can do. I'm still recovering from other life traumas. I'll be okay someday, there's always light at the end of the tunnel. Healing takes time, step by step. This perpetrator may have left some mental/emotional scars on me but I'm stronger than that. I'm a survivor. He abused his position as a pastor but I won't let him taint my faith in God. I believe our justice will be served. Sorry for this fat ramble but I thought you guys should know why my friend's situation upsets me. 

What do you guys think about this? Was this a cult trying to lure L or was this a sex trafficking scheme? Also, I have this Korean lady's phone number since she gave it to L. L was scared but trusted me enough to send me this lady's number. L is from Canada and I'm from the US. We've been online, long-distance friends for years and have video chatted on more than one occasion. No catfish here lol. But onto more serious note. What can I do for L? Is there anything I can do with that number without getting myself or L into trouble? Or should I just let it go? What about other potential victims? Talking about it helps even just a little to spread awareness. 

&amp;#x200B;

WOW. Okay I'm done. Don't know who'll read all of this but just thank you to anyone who takes their time reading all this. God bless and stay safe everybody."
relationship_advice,My Girlfriend (20F) doesn’t seem to trust me when i want to hang out with other girls (20M),"So, i want to start this out by saying that i completely understand where she’s coming from. But on the other hand, i’ve never cheated on her. id never do that, i love her so much. My girlfriend has pretty bad anxiety (as do i) but whenever she hangs with guys i don’t have a problem with it because i trust her. but whenever i say i’m gonna hang out with one of my female friends, she gets really fussy and doesn’t talk to me. I’ve tried approaching it and nothing seems to work. and i want to know to if i’m in the wrong at all or if i’m doing something wrong? Idk, i don’t want to upset her at all, but some of my closest friends are girls. thank you guys."
relationship_advice,"I recently found out my boyfriend follows about 10-15 “Instagram models/lingerie/bikini models” and consistently likes their photos. I’m not the jealous type, but is something off here ?","
To start off I’m not a big social media person at all, but when I do like photos I do it with intention. I think it’s strange that he likes these girls photos consistently even on days when we have had bonding time and fantastic sex. When I mean Instagram models I mean “verified” super tan, bolted on tits, no waist and always showing ass. He verbally and physically appreciates my body and I know that I turn him on, but I wish I could understand from a male perspective, why he might feel the need or desire to follow or like these women’s photos? I’m curious to have some insight. I haven’t brought it up and I don’t think I will because it’s a pretty minute issue considering he will never even meet these women. But just the fact that he is turned on/ interested by these ultra unrealistic social media fantasies is confusing to me."
relationship_advice,Am I too depressed to be dating?,"I've been seeing this guy for a couple of months. I really like him. But because of my depression and being fucked over by so many guys, I just don't believe that he likes me or could ever love me. I'm just having a really hard time not expecting him to leave me. I keep thinking of breaking things off with him. But at the same time, I feel like I'll never find a more decent guy. Like my trust issues and abandonment issues are so bad that I don't think I could ever trust a guy again. Normally if I felt unsure about a guy, I'd bring it up with him or just stop wasting my time. But because I'm clinically depressed and have anxiety on some level, I can't even trust my own feelings because I'm always expecting the worst out of people. Im also waiting for him to get tired of me because of my depression. Should I just break up with him?"
relationship_advice,I've [m30] realized my past 2 relationships have caused me to not open up as much as I used to. Now I'm emotionally struggling with my new girlfriend[f29],"Back in the day I was really good at sappy romantic gestures and not afraid to say I love you. However, my past 2 relationships over the past 5 years really made me lose that part of me. The first ex didnt believe in love at all and we dated for 2.5 years. She actually broke up with me when a friend texted her saying my phone was dead and that I love her and hopes she sleeps well. My friend didn't know we didnt use the word but my ex freaked out over the next month and eventually broke up. 

My recent ex was just a jaded emotional vampire in hindsight. Woe was her and everything sucked. It's funny cause before we even started dating shed say I love you before hanging up and then apologize because it was habitual for her coming out of a divorce. However, during our relationship I just felt like it she would over think things if I ever told her that. I did love her and did more for her than anyone can imagine. 

Anyway, the girl I'm dating now has been great friends with me for 3 years. We got drunk one night, had a singing dance party in my living room and went to bed together. Things are moving so fast emotionally! I think it's because we've been amazing friends for so a while and we're skipping most of the beginning phases of a relationship and going straight to the comfortable stages. 

Couple of days ago I told her I used to always say sappy things or grand romantic gestures in the past but have lost that confidence after my last 2 exes. We were watching the bachelor and they always say / do over the top romantic shit on that show and I commented on it which is how the convo started.

She revealed she loves that kind of stuff and then admitted that she falls in love way too easy. Things got kind of awkward after that and I think she was kicking herself after making that comment. She left earlier than usual and kind of in a rush. 

Picking up on some of that I decided to shoot her a text after she left (which I never do cause I don't wanna be that needy boyfriend) and she responded really well. Since then shes been messaging me about how much she misses me and using a lot of lovey emojis.

I love it but I'm also scared (scarred?) to respond as enthusiastic as I'd like. We've been dating about a month but we've been super close friends for 3 years. Hell, even when I was dating my recent ex I would go to my now girlfriends house to vent and clear my head with her. Shed always give me advice and tell me how I deserve way more than I'm receiving.

Im not asking if it's okay to tell her ""I love you"" or whether or not I should do some super cheesy vday gesture; I guess I just need some reassurance that these feelings are normal and even though it's been only a month, we've already got that fantastic emotional relationship established from our friendship."
relationship_advice,Communication and more,"My boyfriend (M27) sat me (F26) down today and explained he had fallen out of love with me. He said that we had nothing in common and no mutual goals. He said we argue all the time and that he had been unhappy for a few months but didn’t know how to tell me.

I was completely blindsided. I tried explaining that he had never brought this issues up with me and if he did, I would have worked through them with him. Because a lot of what he is saying is fixable. Nothing in common? Let’s find things we both enjoy. We fight all the time? If he ever felt I was being confrontational, he should have stopped me. No mutual goals? He didn’t even know what his own goals were. 

He said he wasn’t family oriented like I was. That he would never want to travel like I do. Those things were never dealbreakers for me. Don’t want to go to Disney? Fine! Why would I drag you to somewhere where you would be miserable? 

I endured a lot of ridicule by being in a relationship with him. He has epilepsy and cannot drive. The traditional roles would never suit us. I never minded but my family did. But they realized I loved him and it didn’t matter to me. He could be moody sometimes. He never Ubered over to my place and I was always driving to his apartment. I would take his credit card and go grocery shopping for him. I would take care of him after seizures. Literally saving his life at some points.

I had voiced some concerns about if we had children, would they inherit his epilepsy? Could I leave them alone with him? I had even decided that maybe it’s best if we didn’t have kids. Again, not a dealbreaker. 

The other horrible part is that we work in the same building. His father is actually the head of my department. My boyfriend has told me to simply not seek him out and to just leave him alone. 

I am lost. He is someone who changed my life. The best way I can describe it is that I was drowning and he pulled me ashore. Now I am kicking myself, wondering what I did wrong, wondering how did this happened, etc.

1) Should I keep pursuing him?
2) Should I find another job?
3) Will he realize that he’s making a mistake?
4) Is this a lost cause?"
relationship_advice,Trying to cope w my insecurities in a healthy manner,My bf of almost 3yrs has several female friends. I am completely confident that he won’t cheat on me but I can’t help but feel ....I don’t even know how to describe it. I feel left out. I’ve never met any of his female friends bc he’s never invited me to join. I saw a thread of messages with a girl and it was all just memes. I know it’s silly but I WANT TO BE SENT MEMES TOO. I don’t want to waste energy on stupid arguments or discussions. I don’t want him to feel like I’m being clingy or that I don’t trust him. I truly want to be able to cope with feelings like these on my own. For the record he’s a great guy that is always wanting to hear about my feelings. I just don’t want to overwhelm him with issues that I need to solve within myself. Any suggestions on how to cope with my own insecurities so that they don’t impose on my relationship?
relationship_advice,A guy asked me out on a first date but never made anything really happen.,"So there’s this guy that I used to see at  the gym who keeps staring at me and making excuses to talk to me finally asked me out on a first date a week ago, for the record, I’m older than he is but look younger than my age, he was surprised to know my real age and told me he wanted to ask me out and I said I’d love to and don’t really care about age and then we exchanged numbers, but ever since never heard of him. So, I decided to text first to ask how he’s doing, and got an unenthusiastic reply after two hours , and then decided to not text again. He didn’t text again too. Why would this guy go out of his way and ask me out on a first date but never make effort to make it happen? I’m very confused and will appreciate some honest answers , thanks."
relationship_advice,Does this person like me or are they just being nice...?,"So me f14 and my crush m14 were put in the same class this year, and I can’t tell if he likes me back or not.
So here’s some reasons why I think he might like me to
1. Whenever there’s a spare seat next to me he always seems to sit next to me
2.today at lunch I was talking to my friends and he waved at me while his friends were with him
3.i catch him glancing at me during class while we’re working

So is he into me or just being nice?

Here’s a little more context:
we aren’t close by any means and I’ve never reallly had a good conversation with him so the fact that he tries to be around me kinda makes me feel like he likes me to. If we were close friends I wouldn’t think that he could like me at all by sitting next to me or waving but I feel like maybe he likes me to..... what do u think?"
relationship_advice,TW:Abuse Do I try to work things out with my ex husband?,"Backstory for those who care: been friends since we were teenagers, eloped, bought a house, had a baby, had plenty of ups and downs over the course of a decade. 

About 2 years ago things started getting really bad between us. I thought it was all his drinking and nastiness, but in Heinsight I had a lot of faults and was stretching him pretty thin in a lot of ways. 

Thanksgiving 2018 he got blackout drunk on tequila and put his hands on me for the first time.   Of course he says he doesn't remember and he is sorry. I felt I had no choice but to leave him. And even that took a month so it wasn't easy. 

FF to Now: I'm having second thoughts about leaving him for many reasons. The biggest one is that my family has completely taken his side and basically shunned me out. He's living in my mom's house, he talks to my dad all the time, my 3 sisters and stepmom are always reaching out telling him to come by cause they miss him. Meanwhile my family is constantly at odds with me. I'm starting to think I'm the problem.

Furthermore I'm feeling sad that my son doesn't have his parents together. And I really wanted more children and for my son to have siblings close in age to him and that's eating away at me. I sold our marital home.

Lastly is that I'm in a new relationship and I'm having a hard time adjusting to living with someone new. As much as I care about him, it was easier on a day to day basis to live with and get along with my ex. My ex and I still get along most of the time co-parenting. 

Of course there are still many things that were unacceptable from both our sides in the marriage but sometimes I think maybe we could have gone to more councelling instead of me just giving up.

I cry every day about this. I'm struggling so much with what to do. Nothing I do feels like the right decision. Has anyone ever been in this situation before? 

TLDR: Was in a toxic marriage, left, my family took husband's side, a year later I'm hysterical daily questioning my decision to leave"
relationship_advice,HOW TO GET OVER A CHEATER?!,"Yes as the title suggests recently just few months ago i (19M) broke with a girl (22F) i was madly in love with i found her sexting with my friend. She never really admitted to those things and didn’t even apologise like that. I honestly don’t hate anyone more than her atm BUT I constantly find myself still looking for her and a little of stalking her acc too??! And whenever i go to her acc she always got things like “oh I’ve dated the wrong person” or “I’m never trusting anyone” which actually hurt to see acknowledging the fact that she was the one lying all the time.

For context she was always the kinda girl that would flirt back and forth with you but when you’d tell her that you like her? She’d instantly throw you off by saying “wtf is this? I always saw you as my brother and stuff”. 

But now I cannot help but thinking that she might be flirting with other guys and stuff (I know it’s very dumb but it is what is it). 

Anyone can relate? Would y’all like to give some advice? :)"
relationship_advice,How do I respond to this without causing an argument?,"Me and my boyfriend are quite new to dating, both each other’s firsts and we’ve made a lot of stupid mistakes but we’re both pretty forgiving and are learning to communicate rather than react. 

Recently he’s been worried about balding (he’s only 17 but his dad does have that genetic trait) 
It’s not impossible to be balding at a young age but he’s become so paranoid that he’s tracking the progress of his hair (I laughed too lol) 
I tried to reassure him that’ll still date him even if he goes bald at 20 and jokingly said that “baldness is linked to intelligence” 

And he said the following which I can’t tell if he’s being serious or sarcastic: 
“I’d rather be retarded with an architecture degree than be Stephen Hawkins” 

And I said “you can’t just say that 😂🤦🏻‍♀️” 
And he said “why” 

How do I respond to that? 
To me using the word retarded is a bit much..right?

relationship_advice,I’m not sure what to do about my LDR,"Boyfriend (20M) and I (25F) are in a LDR and have been together for two and a half years. Recently he’s been trying to get his life more ready for me to be physically part of it. He’s really busy and he tells me things like he can go a few days without texting me at all or he could go a whole year without seeing me “if thats what it took” to have us live together eventually. 

He’s not the most emotionally available guy, but he does try. We had so much fun when he had a lot of free time to visit me and such, but now everything even communication is so seldom now and I miss him like crazy and I get mad because I don’t feel like he misses me at all.

He thinks we should break up and wait until a better time to date when he has his life together, but he also doesn’t want to do that. He’s a little indecisive of what he wants to do to make this last as short as possible. 

I just don’t know what to do. Even if he breaks up with me I know he’ll still love me, or at least that’s what he says. I’m not sure anymore.

Basically: What do I do? What can I do? Am I being insensitive?"
relationship_advice,Should I ask for closure?,"My partner broke things off over the phone recently due to chronic yet minor arguments. We broke up once before (in person) but decided to give it another shot. We lives only 30 minutes apart but my partner refused to do it in person, neither through video calls. There are belongings that we left at each other’s apartments, most of his that are left at mine have sentimental value for him. I tried to call him for an hour yesterday, and finally left him a text asking about what to do with the belongings, but no response.

I’m not sure if I should ask for closure because I don’t know if it is really over. It seems to be out of his character to speak about important things over the phone. Last time we broke up, he rushed to remove facebook’s relationship status and our photos off social media. This time around, the social media remained untouched and I saw him being online throughout the day. 

I’m tempted to give him a call, but at the same time I feel it’s better if I wait for him to reach out. What should I do?"

We've been talking for about half a year now almost every day, often for hours long. About 3 months ago we started watching movies and series together over skype, which has always been fun. We've had fights, we took a break, he have fun together, we can tell each other eveything, we have a lot in common but most importantly, we love eachother.


Yesterday we were supposed to watch another movie together, but ended up just talking for 4 hours. We have played around with the idea of being together for the past 2 months orso, and we talked about it then aswell. At some point I asked her if she would want us to be together hypothetically and she said yes. Later I asked her and again she said yes, we were both so happy it was awesome.

 I've never had a girlfriend let alone an online one. I have no idea what to do now or how things will change. To be honest it's kinda scary. I do ofcourse want to be with her, any advice?"

relationship_advice,Me (21) F dating a (25) M have been dealing with differences within our relationship.,"I’m in a Interracial relationship but getting tired of the racist jokes.

So as you can guess I’m in a relationship with a black bf (25) M and I’m a white woman (21) F. I can handle jokes but lately all of his jokes have been leaning towards the color of my skin or white stereotypes. His first joke within in our relationship while we were talking about making dinner he said something along the lines “I’m going to have to teach you how to season your chicken because you white people don’t know how to make a chicken the proper way.” I kinda felt awkward about this comment because he assumed I didn’t know how to cook chicken based on my skin color which I have no idea what that has to do with making a chicken and I just laughed it off and pretended it didn’t bug me as much. Fast forward to a few days later we got into a deep discussion about our exes and how we were treated in our previous relationships and when I was done telling him about my past relationship my boyfriend turned around and said “Must suck to see him still during family gatherings.” Implying that I dated one of my family members. I was really mad about this comment and I told him that he was being kind of racist and how it was inappropriate to say that about one of my family members and he proceeds to say you can’t be racist to a white person because blacks were oppressed and that it is just a joke and I needed to get over it. At this point I went on about how that is unfair for him to just brush of my feelings and making me feel guilty for calling him out on his inappropriate racist jokes. I asked him how he would like it if a dropped the “n” word around and he said I can’t compare that to his “harmless jokes” because I have white privilege and he doesn’t."
relationship_advice,"Husband [43M] says I [38F] was being ‘inappropriate’ with my son. I feel sick, sad and I need some help.","My husband [43M] and I [38F] are at an impasse over this awful thing and I need some help or some objective insight.


We've been married for almost 3 years, together for almost 10. It's been quite turbulent and rollercoaster-ish. We both have our baggage that we struggle with but we've tried our best to overcome it with a lot of love.


I also have a son, [11M] who spends his time split between me and my ex-husband (son's dad). Son and I are very close - he's awesome, I love him to bits. He's funny and clever and lazy and smart and very much like me. We love hanging out. My husband and my son, however, are very different people. They have a distant, sometimes difficult relationship but we've tried to hard to find a balance over the years.


So, on to the other night... my son and I were hanging out in the backyard, on a blanket, playing Scrabble. It's warm where I am so I've been wearing short, cool summer dresses and scant/little clothing at night (relevant in a minute). It's how I'm comfortable, and how I've always dressed at home when it's hot - and I've never thought anything of it. Anyway, we're having a great time, I'm helping son with some tricky words and letters, we're laughing and joking around. Son goes to the bathroom, I'm still lying on the blanket, when all of a sudden I hear husband say 'Hey, maybe you should pull your skirt down?'


I turn around, and husband is there, with a really stormy look on his face. He goes back inside, I follow, he's *visibly* tense. I ask him what's wrong, he pulls a face, I ask if I've done something, and I'm hit with a barrage.


How I'm lying there with my 'arse hanging out'. How I'm being 'inappropriate' with my 11 year old son. How I lie in son's room 'topless'(?? I never do this, son would be mortified!) How son is rolling all over me while I have my dress hiked up (son was certainly leaning on me like I'm an armchair as he's done since he was a little kid, and I had no idea my dress was raised?) All said with such.... anger. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut - still do. 


To clarify, yes I love my son, but I will never, *would never*, do anything 'inappropriate' with him, nor with any other child, for that matter. The thought makes me feel physically ill. We're not a prudish family but we're not an open shower-door, chat while on the toilet, nude type of family (not that I actually have a problem with that, but I take my son's cues in relation to privacy which he's requested more of since he's gotten older). Son would have seen me in a bikini or in my bra when I'm out of the shower, but to my family and culture that's quite normal. I was wearing underwear under my dress, and I didn't know that it wasn't covering me.


I tried to apologise and then defend myself, but husband wasn't having it. I felt like vomiting, if I'm being honest. Son comes out and I take him outside to finish our game but I'm shaking and very upset (though I think I hide it ok from son). We finish up, he beat me (yay!) but I feel so... shaken, uncomfortable, and weirded out. Husband has gone into the bedroom and shut the door so I tell son to go inside and hang on his iPad for a few minutes.


 I go in to talk to husband, try to tell him that I was shaken by what he said, asked him exactly what he was implying. Again, he wasn't having it. The 'topless' incident was apparently not me topless, but wrapped in a blanket lying down - but husband 'saw my tits hanging out' when he came to say good morning. He told me again that I was being inappropriate with my pre-pubescent son. The language he was using was sexual - tits, arse, he accused me of lying with my 'legs wide open' (I really wasn't!). I had to leave the room to calm down and I couldn't believe what he was saying, it was so disgusting to me. When I calmed I went back to ask if we could have a better, non-emotional conversation and tried to tell him that different families might have different boundaries, that I'd stayed with families who have an open bathroom door, no issues with nudity-type households, and I don't judge them. That my dress might have ridden up but it certainly wasn't purposeful, that me being wrapped in a blanket is the same as a towel after a shower. In no way, shape or form would I ever be 'inappropriate' with my child. 


Even though he conceded that I 'might not' be doing it on purpose he kept repeating what he thinks I was doing, that he's a pre-pubescent boy, that I need to be more aware. I wasn't going to argue at this point, I'd had enough, I felt sick. I couldn't process how someone could turn my innocent, affectionate parental relationship with my son into something sexual. That's so hard for me to type, so incredibly gross for me to think about.


I couldn't look at my husband again that night. Three days later, I still can't. He thinks I'm giving him the silent treatment - I'm not. I just can't abide what he was saying, I can't look at him without thinking about what he was saying, how he could think that. He did actually apologise that night but it was 'I'm not angry at you and I didn't mean to upset you', like accusing me of inappropriate behaviour with my 11 year old son wouldn't be upsetting?? He doesn't seem to get what a hand-grenade he threw into our marriage. I can't close him out forever, but I can't talk to him, either. 


What do I do? Am I crazy? Was he right? Please bear in mind that we're not American, we don't have the nudity=sex culture inherent there (not that I was even naked!) and what I describe would be normal in most households of my friends and family. But now I find myself brushing my son off when he hugs me when husband is around and our household is all tense and awful. I'm all kinds of messed up. Reddit, help?"
relationship_advice,I caught my boyfriend sexting another boy!!,"So I’m not entirely unsure what I am hoping to achieve from posting this, but last night I found messages on my boyfriends phone (we’re both males) of him sexting another boy (he gave me his phone willingly as I’m not one to go through people’s stuff without permission) The messages are so disgusting, and they led onto sending nudes to each other on Snapchat. I am obviously in complete love with him, but am so scared that if I take him back I’m mugging myself off, which I kind of know I already am 😂 Just want to know if I’m the only one that would consider taking him back or shall I leave know matter how painful it’s going to be"

relationship_advice,How do I start emotionally detaching myself from my husband so it’s easier to leave later,"We’ve had a pretty shitty relationship since the beginning, and our marriage has been pretty bad for a while. He treats me like shit and makes me cry at least twice a week. I’m pregnant with his child but I know I’m not just being hormonal and sensitive because this has been going on since before I became pregnant.

If he ever hurts my feelings, I’m usually the one that ends up apologizing because he somehow always turns things around on me. Has manipulative af and has gaslit me since literally the day we started dating. He refuses to go to any kind of therapy so I’m 99% our marriage is helpless at this point. 

I’m just waiting for my baby to be born so I can become a bit more financially independent before I leave.

Even with all this problems, I’m literally addicted to him and the toxicity of our relationship. I know it’s going to hurt like hell when I leave him and I guess I just want advice on how I can start preparing for that. Right now we’re arguing because he was being straight up mean earlier but I really want to cuddle to be able to fall asleep, so I’ll probably end up being the one brushing everything under the carpet again and initiating affection, while he gets to just get away with being rude. How can I start developing strength to not do this shit anymore?"
relationship_advice,A family crisis ended on my (M26) father (M65) calling me to tell me that he wants to die,"Mandatory English not my first language.  


First time posting here, sorry for any wrong thing. Also, buckle up, I think this isn't gonna be short.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: My grandma on my father's side left us with her apartment as she died about 10 years ago. Since then it has been rented, but the last tenants trashed the place very, **very** badly. Having to reform the flat anyway, my two parents (M65 and F64) decided to pay for it all and gift it to my girlfriend (Genderfluid, she, 24) and to me (M26) as my inheritance.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a heavy drinker who has built such resistance that he never seems notoriously drunk, but in the end he spends mostly of his days on the bar, He has also been a heavy smoker until a pneumony kept it in the hospital for two weeks. Left smoking altogether.

 Since I have memory, he is easy to upset, always in a bad mood. He never hit my mother nor me, but approaching to him has been always hard, as you never know how he will handle the recieved information. Sometimes he grunts, sometimes he just listens but if he cooperates, it has to be as he wants it to be, and if it ends not being, he will tear his way through the issue by yelling. This is the important part: This taught me to shut up and say yes to everything around him, or else I had to deal with this toxic and moody atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother on the other hand is the sweetest person, and I have always had a stronger bond to her, just making my father jealous and leaving him thinking that we are keeping him apart, when he does it himself with his bad moods. She has done everything she could to keep my father from drinking and smoking, and after decades, he stopping smoking felt like a triumph to her. The problem is that he has turned all in into drinking in bars now. Since I moved out 2 years ago she has been getting more and more fed up of him, with a lot of destructive arguments until yesterday it all exploted.

&amp;#x200B;

Shetold me that they had an argument yesterday morning, in which she expressed to him for the last time that she hasn't been happy around him for an eternity. That she is sick of living with someone who is losing everything and everyone around him and seems to not care by drinking more. That he hasn't been a good father to me in his all life. That he hasn't got the right to criticize me for my time management when he hasn't helped her with home chores ever. Normal stuff here, but then things got worse. She told him that he will have to cross over her dead body before ruining with his mere existence my gf's and my own happiness (specially involving the move to the new flat). That divine justice will come to him by having neglected his family for almost 40 years (this has special weight when you factor in that my mother is a devote believer and my father is an atheist). It scalated to the point in which she remembers the girl my father liked when they were young, before dating my mother, who rejected him. The reason was the thought of ""lucky her, what a bullet she dodged"".

&amp;#x200B;

That same afternoon my father called me from a bar, judging from the environmental background noise. He spoke fast and upset but I can never tell how much alcohol he has on him. He explained his side of the argument, and the two versions were pretty much the same. Then he babbled how he doesn't want to know anything about the flat reform (currently in the final stages, a week of tweaking left). After that, that he doens't want to go to the next doctors appointment. Then, that he has ways of getting out of the picture. And before hanging up the call he explained how he plans on electrocuting himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's when I come to you, redditors. I've been tired all of my life of microgestioning around my parents. To keep a cheery façade when the atmosphere is gloomy. What to say and what not to say to not trigger his mood swings. But I still love them both. They care about me and show it the way they know, and I feel like it all boils down to them not knowing how to communicate to sort things out. But I'm still feeling trapped: I feel like I am the one who has to be the bridge between them. That I have to mediate, because without any help, the situation will just go astray.

On the other hand, I wanna live my own life and not let this taint my daily life and specially my gf's. But then I feel selfish, living in a flat reformed for me (even though they never asked me anything in return, gaslighted me or blackmailed me in any way) while my father is in his lowest.

I don't know what I should do, how much emotional energy I should invest and how to deal with guilt if I decide to look for myself and not let this touch me"

relationship_advice,Interesting turn if events.,"So recently I've been talking with someone who I knew from the get go was married. He's 32 with 2 kids, a wife and a dog. We met in weird way but I don't feel like explaining that part due to revealing to much. 

Long story short, I'm 22 and pretty sure I am currently in a relationship with a married man. I know it's technically wrong but we are both incredibly happy together.

relationship_advice,My (30m) gf (30f) is acting like she can’t afford food...,"I’ve been dating my gf for over a year now and things are going really well...the only thing is she has lately expressed that she’s really stressed about money. She hasn’t worked for over a year but says she has enough saved up for at least a year’s worth of rent money from here out. However, she recently told me that she’s been getting food through a program reserved for low income and homeless people at her school.

How can she be in a financial situation that’s dire to the point where she needs to resort to this type of food program - yet she has enough savings to last a full year’s worth of rent? I asked her why she just doesn’t dip into her savings for food and she said she didn’t want to talk about it. I asked if her family was paying her rent - or anyone else - and she denies it. I’m concerned about her if she can’t afford to eat - but something about this situation doesn’t add up to me. Her evasiveness makes me feel like she isn’t being fully transparent with me.

I know that an ex in her past stole money from her so she might be triggered by someone wanting to pry too much about her finances - but she knows I’m employed and make good money on my own. I’m just concerned about her wellbeing and that she might not be fully honest with me. She says she wants to move in together some day but I fear she’ll be financially dependent on me for rent, food, etc. and I frankly can’t afford that. What should I do here? Should I just mind my own business and stop asking about it? Should I be concerned about her situation?"
relationship_advice,My (23F) boyfriend (32M) is obsessed with his ex,"He broke up with her five years ago and they were together for five years. Anytime something reminds him of his ex he talks about her extensively. We were watching a movie and one scene took place where they went on vacation and he told me about it and showed me pictures. He then proceeded to say negative things about her and he insulted her a lot. This is a cycle he does often...He still has a bunch of pictures of her on his phone (including nudes), but he has pictures of all his ex’s on his phone. He tells me he would kill her if he didn’t have a son...I don’t know something just doesn’t sit well with me. He told me how she ran off with some doctor. The craziest thing was when he told me how she dropped his car off andshe didn’t even wait for him to say anything she just ran fast in the other direction. He even admitted to me that he misses somethings about her. We were at a restaurant once and he saw a girl who looked like his ex. We literally walked passed her five times so he could look at her. I can’t tell him how this bothers me because he hates jealous women and he’ll get mad. He claims he’s over her, but he’s still bitter.

Any advice?"

relationship_advice,Me 27M Girl 27F.. Don't ever listen to women on how to attract women,"So I just started talking to a very pretty girl. We hit it off great at first and planned a date. Typical luck she tests positive for the flu 2 days after. It really put a damper on my ability to start something. I sent messages everyday for like a week saying ""Hope you're feeling better. I'm really sorry your having to go through this."" And rarely got a response. So a week went by, and I feel its appropriate to start sealing the deal on a date. Only when I text asking to go out, guess.... no response. I then went on to say, ""I'd rather not wait until August when I go to Penn Wharton for an MBA to start a relationship, but if it comes to that then it'd be fine with me. You seemed really happy to do this a week ago. Don't be a flake. I have a ton going for me."" She finally responds saying I'll let you know. I then respond, ""I know what I'll let you know means. I'm gonna set the dates for February 7th at blank restaurant"" She then responds okay I'll do it, and it's now set. It may follow through, it may not. Point is that women respond to that kind of talk, not ""I hope you're doing okay beautiful. I really hate for any fragile beautiful human to have to suffer like you are."" Women might say they want the guy to comfort them when they're sick and a guy to shower compliments to them, but in my experience in life that's not true. What they are actually attracted to is a guy that tells them exactly what's going to happen when and they're welcome to join because you have a prosperous life but if not next one will come along sooner or later.

Incoming feminists to say you attract the wrong type of girl. Incoming feminist to say that wouldn't work on me. Yes. Yes it would."
relationship_advice,Advice on how to rekindle my relationship after a traumatic experience,"Please forgive me for any spelling errors or bad punctuation, thank you 

I’m 20(F) my boyfriend is 40 our age gap was never an issue, but recently his daughter 17 went through the most traumatic event anyone could go through. My BF and I have had a slowly declining sex life for the past 3 months I would say. But what happened to his daughter just happened about last week so neither of us have really had any interest in sex, but I was talking to him last night and he basically expressed that he can’t even kiss me let alone engage in any type of sex he said to me something along the lines of when he looks at me he can’t help but to feel like I’m his daughter I want to be patient and give him time to really process everything but I’m scared that if we don’t kiss hold hands and cuddle and basically still have an emotional and physical connection he will continue to feel how he does now with me, I want to be there for him and his daughter, but I don’t know how to stop him or help him get through this mind set he’s has of me. I’m just overwhelmed I love him, I want to be with him but i can’t have my boyfriend looking at me in this light.

Thank you to anyone who can give me advice and or takes the time to read this."

relationship_advice,Been hanging out with a really cool person but my self esteem is too low to ask them out or even admit I have feelings,"Apologies in advance if my english is not that great or if I miss something important. Also apologies for bad text, I'm on my phone rn.
I've been sad since august 2019, I'm not gonna call it depression or anything since I've never actually been diagnosed with anything. Everyday up until October I was a daily drinker and I started to ignore all my friends. That's when I started hanging out more with my friend in question and we were both drinking together daily (they were sore after a breakup). After a few weeks like that, we managed to cut down to drinking just 2 days per week. I then had pneumonia and she helped me not drink and ruin the treatment (due to my emotional state, I expressed wanting to die from it and keep drinking). So they basically stopped me from killing myself. After new year's eve, I was diagnosed with a lung condition that required me to quit smoking in order to let the lungs heal and prevent further infection. She quit smoking for me just to motivate me to do the same and it worked. I was not willing to quit smoking until I realised that she actually cares. No one has ever done that for me before. I have helped her thru some tough times as well but I cannot go into detail there out of respect for her. But these last few weeks, we kissed after drinking. Due to my low self esteem I just acted like nothing happened the next day and to be fair, it was nothing, just kissing. Just so you understand why I feel like she never could like someone like me: she loves parties, i find them painful, she is extroverted, im not, she wants a guy who takes the mantle, im as perverted as an asexual. So I was never really thinking it was anything serious, just a drunken mistake she kept on making every week. Last weekend tho, we didn't drink and we kissed anyway.
I know how cringey this all sounds, little introverted kid who doesn't care about his health gets put on his feet by the perfect girl and yes, I agree, it is cringey. I understand that sometimes it is better to have a good friend rather than a good lover, but after last week, it's like something popped and I realised I actually like her more than just a friend.
How do I bring my self esteem back up just enough for some courage to ask her out?
And if I get fz-ed, it would be a first, how do I deal with that?
Do any of you even think we would fit based on the little information I'm letting out?
I know it's a normal ""we've all been there"" sorta thing, but it means a lot to me even tho I understand I'll get over rejection. I've been lonely for so long and she's just the greatest thing in my life right now. I don't want to mess everything and I don't want to keep my feelings to myself anymore (and it's just been a week).
Thanks for reading all that rambling, sorry again if I sound confusing, forgot to mention I'm writing this as I'm having some sorta breakdown."
relationship_advice,I had a dream about my ex (16m),"So I’ve been having relatively the same dream about my ex for the last week or so but every night since the first dream I haven’t been able to fall asleep cause I can’t get her off my mind. Even though I was the one to end the relationship I can’t help but think it could have gone so much better. I have a new girlfriend (17) since my ex and we’ve been dating for almost 8 months now and she’s insanely obsessed with me and Ig I could say I love her but for the past couple months I’ve been like on and off in my feels randomly and thinking about if I’m truely happy in this relationship. The girl I’m dating now took my virginity and she is already talking about marriage and moving in together and everything and I just can’t imagine myself getting married to the first girl I’ve ever gotten past oral with. My ex has blocked me on most social media but she didn’t block my phone # (I know this cause I texted her drunk a couple days after I broke up with her...) I don’t know if I should reach out and say something to her or just keep my feelings in. I know if my current gf ever found out about these feelings I’ve been having it would be a bad time for me but I’m scared to break up with her cause she is a really nice girl and like wife material honestly but I’m not ready for that at all. This has kinda been all over the place, if anyone reads all of this thanks and maybe give me some advice. This is after all relationship advice."
relationship_advice,Almost four years of dating ended over an email. I was going to propose within the next few months.,"I’ve dealt with shit in my life. An abusive upbringing, loss of those close to me, but I’ve hit a new low, and need help/ advice. 

My girlfriend and I started dating my freshman year of Highschool. She was a year older than me, and thus went to college during my last year of high school. She struggled to integrate into her college between constantly calling me and her family (who are like family to me, because of the abuse I experienced when at home). Eventually she managed, but it was definitely a struggle. A big struggle during the first year of long distance is halfway through, I experienced attraction for someone else, something neither of us had experienced. I didn’t interact with this girl because it made me feel extremely guilty, and my gf and I almost broke up (my breaking up with her) in my feeling so guilty about it- like I was betraying her, it wasn’t normal, etc. This girl was truly the spitting image of my girlfriend: their names, majors, appearance, demeanor, etc. To an extent, it was creepy. 

My girlfriend was visiting town when I talked with her about it. I comforted her. We mostly moved on, though whenever I mentioned the school (I met this girl through singing in the college’s choir in my town), or the choir itself, my girlfriend was obviously torn. 

Fast forward a year. We got much stronger since then, though I suppose I didn’t take advantage of social opportunities as much as I could’ve. I ended up getting rejected from her college, and going to the college in the town we grew up in, which made her resent the school. Additionally, I felt like I needed to go to her school for the relationship. I did tours, interviews, met with a variety of faculty, etc. I procrastinated on my transfer applications because it felt like an obligation. I didn’t rely on people at my school because socially, emotionally, sexually, etc, my girlfriend met all my needs. We communicated every day through texting, and called every other day or so. 

She visited for her winter break of about month. Our relationship was stronger than ever. She went back to college, and had a week long tour with her college choir. We didn’t end up talking much. She got back to her dorm, and called me sobbing. She said we need to take a break, that we’re too reliant on each other for happiness, that she couldn’t enjoy her tour or time with her friends because she lives for the moments in between. To see me, talk to me, etc.

I was in shock. I disagreed at first, but soon realized she was right. We negotiated terms. Essentially, we agreed to be friends that wouldn’t date/sleep with other people. I began to explore my social opportunities.  I spent time with new friends, and went out of my comfort zone. 

Five days later, she calls me again. She says she has something to tell me: she experienced attraction over her choir trip. She became close with a guy, and while in a group, he whispered to her that he felt attraction for her. She admitted she felt the same, but said it wouldn’t work because they’re both in committed relationships. He broke up with his girlfriend two days later. She told me she wanted to go on a break soon after as well. I felt truly betrayed, like I had been lied to. Because I suffer from anxiety, I was stuck in a cycle of feeling like this was my fault, worrying she was cheating on me, hiding something etc., wanting to confront her, and then not because I wanted to give her space. I settled for asking her a couple questions spaced throughout a few days: “Did you cheat on me?” “What is the nature of the attraction?” Answered by “No, I don’t know”. Ultimately, we called on the phone. I said I didn’t want to do the break anymore. I said that all of our interactions were negative at this point, and it was tainting our relationship. She agreed, and said I could try to interact with her and cheer her up if I wanted, but it was extremely difficult. She felt like a completely different person, to the extent her roommate/ best friend started crying because she felt like she didn’t know my gf anymore. 

So what happened? Well, I did the petty thing of following this guy on Instagram. (I know, shocking: a reddit user committing a cardinal sin?!) I learned he produces music in an indie band, but generally forgot about it. Later she asked me if I did. I answered honestly, and said it was petty. She said it was unhealthy. 

However, I was confused. Instagram removed the feature where you can see the activity of those that you follow. Either she was constantly refreshing my “following” list, or was having contact behind my back and the guy mentioned it. 

I asked (over text, very gently) “how did you know I followed him?”

She cut off all contact. For the rest of the day, she left me on read. I explained that it really wasn’t a big deal (which I genuinely felt), but I wanted to understand why. She sent me an email. “So begins the hardest email I’ve ever had to write. It’s over. I’ll love you always”. I didn’t see it until the morning. During the night, I had a nightmare she cheated on me, followed by a panic attack. It was the first time I had a panic attack since getting out of my abusing household a year prior. 

I checked my email and saw. I was devastated. I called, I texted, with no reply. Ultimately, I said something on the lines of “All signs are pointing to that you cheated on me. I don’t want to believe that’s true, but have no way of knowing without us talking about this.” She said it’s not true. 

I asked if we could call in a week. Generally, I talk about emotions pretty immediately, but I knew this needed time, as much as it hurts. 

Today, about three days later, I remembered I had (extremely ironically) written and sent a letter before the break up happened, in a moment of thinking it was going to work out. The contents of which talked about my grandparents who I’m slowly watching die, and how it’s made me realize we can lose so much in the blink of an eye. (Essentially, I could say I love you or display affection a million times before my relationship with my girlfriend ends, but I want to give it a shot in the meantime.)
I told her the letter should’ve arrived by now, and it’s up to her whether she reads it. I mentioned that because I have midterms coming up, I’d like to talk about this when possible. She said she would ask her therapist if she thinks it’s a good idea. 

I guess the reason I’m here is, I’m lost. 

Academically, I’m extremely dissatisfied with my school, though I’m socially growing. I want to still apply to her school, but there’s obviously a variety of internal factors. I have so many questions that I feel like won’t be answered. I don’t want to give up on this because of the fact that I feel like her being this “different person” has greatly influenced her acting so erratically compared to her normal self. 

Whether you read through this entire thing, skimmed, or just read the title, I really need some guidance in my life right now. Whether words of encouragement or advice, anything helps. Feel free to ask any questions and I’ll try my best to answer."

relationship_advice,I (F20) need constant attention from my bf,"Okay I know this already sounds horrible but let me explain. I have been with my bf for a year now and 8 months into the relationship I moved in with him.

My family was abusive and I had no real friends so when we started living together I had the chance to cut ties and I haven't spoken to them since. My extended family decided to take my parents side, even though they had no idea about my living situation, so I have no contact with them either.

I don't miss any of those people but that doesn't prevent me from feeling terribly alone.My bf is the only person I have been talking to for months now and since he has a job he usually stays awake for maybe 2-3 hours after he comes home.

He gives me a lot of attention and emotional support but I don't want to be dependent on him.
I get really sad when he wants to spend some alone time, even though I understand he should have some time to relax. I know it must be tiring to have someone that craves attention so much just because they have no other human contact.

Also I would like to add that I am in therapy, I try to communicate with my partner and I cannot make friends in my gym/job/school even though I tried. Just something to take into account while answering

thank you so much for reading"
relationship_advice,How do I [34M] keep my ex from stringing me along?,"My ex is my dream girl... the one who had a baby with another man while we were dating and told me it was mine. We were living together when that happened too. Well... I was living at her house. The kid's dad ended up being her ex boyfriend. She always told me he was her friend Kelly's boyfriend. I never did meet Kelly.

Well, she messaged me Monday night and said she wants to meet up for dinner and catch up. Her boyfriend works nights and her parents were watching the kid because she was supposed to have a girls night so he wouldn't even know about it either. I went to her house to pick her up and when I got there she basically pulled me inside and we went to town on each other. Didn't even make it out for dinner. Now I can't stop thinking about her and she won't respond to my messages because her boyfriend is around and I'm a bit heart broken. This hurt a lot.

I'm kinda freaking out over here. I messaged her for hours knowing she couldn't respond, but then she said told me that her boyfriend left and then she didn't respond. WTF? Should I message her again tomorrow?"
relationship_advice,M17 Im in a situation I’ve never been in before and need help!!,"[M17] [A18] [B16]

So about 3 weeks ago I made a bumble account. I started to talk to this one girl we will call girl A. Girl A and I seem to have good vibes and we’re making good connections. We are still talking and are gonna go on a “hangout/date” thing on 02/01/20. Now let’s get to girl B. About 3 days ago girl B asked me to go to a dance at my school. She wrote to me that she likes me and wants to go with me. I was like “sure thing”. We continued to talk that day and had really good vibes as well. So here comes the problem. Girl B is now constantly trying to hangout with me. She’s asks me to go out during lunch, after school, and now over the weekends. I’m really new to this and am not sure if it’s normal for a girl that likes me to be this way. I went out with her during our lunch period for the last two days but I enjoy being inside with my friends more. Also I want to say that I’m more physically attracted to girl A if that changes the situation at all. So I need advice on what to do if girl A and I start going out and also how to tell girl B I want my own free time without being a dick. I hope this all makes sense lol"
relationship_advice,I think I have OLD and its affecting my relationship (Need Advice ASAP) 🥺,"Hi so im pretty sure i have obsessive love disorder because ive been through a lot of trauma and its hard to deal with people leaving me and stuff so i have attachment issues and i think ive become a little too attached to my girlfriend. i love her heart and everything that there is to her, and its caused me to want to protect her from anybody that could possibly hurt her. It bothers me when shes with anybodyy like even friends or when shes out doing stuff too and i know its dumb but i cant control my feelings i just get this really  bad feeling in my heart. The only way for me to stop feeling this way is to be controlling and stop her from doing anything which obviously isnt an option for me. i HATE that im like this because i love this girl with alllll my heart. But i feel like breaking up is whats best bc its not healthy for either of us. But like i said i’ve been through a lot of trauma and deal with depression so i dont know if this is really going to help me. Thoughts ?"
relationship_advice,I(18F) am having problems with my bf(17M) because of the different walks of life we come from. Im rich and he comes from a middle class family.,"So basically , we love each other and have no problems except this. First I will provide some details.
Im American and he's Indian and he lives in India with his parents. We have been dating for 6 months. A month ago I brought him to my house and he said he was impressed and nothing more came of that. But now when i buy him gifts. He doesn't accept them. I like to take him out for dinners but he declines. But he is perfectly fine with going to  McDonalds or fast-food chains and we take turns paying. I proposed that we should take a trip to europe after his school ends in March. Ik he lives with his parents and doesn't have any money. So I told him that the trip is payed for and he doesn't have to worry about anything. He said that he doesn't want to go because its an expensive trip. But we could go some place local in the city he lives in. We have already done that. I got angry and told him , that I needed time to cool off. So we decided to go home and talk it out the next day. I told him that it made me sad that he declined my gifts and told him everything I felt. He apologized and told me that while he enjoys the time I spend with him he doesn't want to leech of me and be a golddigger ( he told me his friends make fun of him sometimes and told him that he should tell me to buy him stuff , he said that he cut contact with them and they weren't really his friends if they didn't respect me. ) I told him I understand what he meant and why he did not accept any gifts but I have never thought of him that way and reassured him that he's not like that. He had to go so we will talk on Saturday about this. But the problem I have is that he doesn't get a lot of gifts. I have seen his room , its just has a bed and a weird wardrobe which is outside the wall and a study table that's in bad condition. His phone is broken and he doesn't have a lot of clothes. He had a really shitty childhood and I just want him to live better. His parents are really shitty too and he hates them. His parents don't buy him stuff but have money for themselves and live better than he does. Am I wrong ? What should I do ? Ik I should respect his boundaries but he said he likes it when he gets gifts.( when i asked him ). A weird thing that I have noticed is when we go out he spends a lot of time looking at kids stuff like toys and stuff. ( He doesn't look at kids just toys ).
He also wants to get out of India but he wont take my help. I just want him to be happy. What do I do ?"
relationship_advice,Helped my girlfriend (24F) find a room to rent and I (22M) think I screwed myself over,"My gf was looking for a room to rent out in April for a year as her current lease is ending. She lived kind of far from me and wanted to move closer to where I lived and have easy access to her work transit. We can't live together because of my personal financial reasons. So, I found a listing on Craigslist where a couple was renting out a room with a shared bathroom in my area, within my gf's budget, and close to her work transit. I thought it was perfect and so she planned to meet with the couple. After their exchange, she calls me and lets me know how incredible the couple was, how they are totally fine with me visiting her on weekends, and how she's really considering moving in. She lets me know that the couple is renting out their garage to another guy who is also in a relationship. His gf goes to college in another city, however. I wasn't too affected by the news because I trust my gf and didn't think it was a big deal since he lived in the garage. Afterwards, however, she lets me know that the couple is renting out the other room to the girlfriend's brother who plays American football for a well-known team in the area (I won't mention the name for privacy reasons, but its a pretty popular team). She let me know that he is also in a relationship and that he plans to move out by the summer, anyway. They would have to share a bathroom, though. She asked me how I felt about the situation but I honestly have no idea how to feel. I obviously trust my gf as we have been together for 4 years, but I can't help but feel insecure over the idea, too. She has never lived with guys before and I went into this thinking she would only share a house with a couple. Should I get over it and be okay with this? 

TL;DR: Gf of 4 years is planning to move into a home with a straight couple and 2 other straight guys- one being an American football player for a well known team. Both are in relationships with gfs not in the area, however. She would have to share a bathroom with the football player, as well. Should I be okay with this?"
relationship_advice,I want my boyfriend to break up with me,"This is going to sound stupid but here goes nothing. I've been dating a guy for 3 years, since high school. I'm in my second year of university now. I loved him, and I still do, but over the last 6 months somethings changed and I don't know why. He can be controlling sometimes, but I've learned to get used to that. Otherwise, there's next to nothing wrong with him. I just don't feel like I'm in love with him anymore and I'm not even sure if that's true? I can't tell. I know I love him and I care about him, and I don't want to break up with him. I literally wish something would go wrong so I had a reason too, like he'd cheat on me or something. Or I wish he would break up with me. I don't care to have sex with him anymore, or even hangout with him that often, and sometimes being around him just annoys me. I even fantasize about other guys sometimes. It makes me feel terrible because he's a great guy, has a great job, great family. We have fun together too. So why do I feel this way????? I don't know what to do,. Maybe it's just that we've been together so long that now I'm bored of him? Which isn't a good reason to stay with someone. What if I broke up with him and regret it? He doesn't believe in breaks, so I can't do that either. I feel this way a lot but sometimes I'm like no, I don't want to be without him. Someone tell me what they think is going on :( I'm so lost.

Tl;dr I want my bf to break up with me but I love him"

relationship_advice,My bf's (25m) best friend bullies him,"My bf has been friends with this guy since they were 4. Growing up my bf was overweight and according to him his bestie was the good looking guy that all the girls wanted. I think this dynamic has continued and more often than not my bf is upset by him.

I have met the best friend once (recently). We were supposed to meet in the centre of the city where it was convenient for everyone. My bf calls me an hour before to say his best friend refuses to come into the centre of town and we have to meet near the best friend's home on the outskirts of the city. This meant I had to travel for 90 minutes and bf travelled for 2 hours to meet this best friend.

He was nice at the meeting but kept going to the toilet. I later found out he had been doing coke in the toilets (according to my bf). He was nice but I felt he was assessing me. He is very charming, traditionally handsome and doing very well. My bf is more of an introvert,  hates his job and is attractive in his own way. At the meeting the best friend spoke highly of my bf and I got the impression he cared about him.

My bf is often upset by him. This guy often belittles him and makes him feel bad. He also can be very controlling and the friendship group he and my bf are part of usually sides with the best friend.

How can I support my bf? what advice can I give? 

TL;DR my bf and his best friend have been friends for over 20 years. His best friend is very dominant and often upsets him. How can I support my bf?"
relationship_advice,My GF (22F) And I (25M) Have sex less than once a month and I'm really unhappy.,"Backstory: We've been dating for two years, had our ups and downs etc. But generally have been really happy together. We do not live together, for various financial/post-secondary school reasons, we still live at our respective parents places. In the beginning We had sex once a week, maybe more, but we were always really satisfied with how much we had.


 About 5-6 months ago she finally told me she is not comfortable having sex at her place, or doing anything sex related, because her parents are almost always in the next room to her bedroom (10 feet away) and don't really go out much.  And by that I mean they don't go out. So that leaves one place to do it. My place. My parents don't like it, they have told us not to do it under their roof, want my bedroom door wide open at all times (Even though I close it and lock it while we're in there) but it's the only place she feels comfortable enough to do it. Before anyone suggests a car, we live in Canada, It's very cold in winter, and the car running is super suspicious at night. Hotel rooms are out of the question as well, too expensive.

The last probably 6-8 months or so though sex has been throughly lacking. We've had a couple major fights in the last year, but we've gotten through them and have been made stronger. But the sex still isn't there. And it's not for a lack of me trying. I try to turn her on, I take her out on nice dates, I take her out on expensive dates, I spend alot of time with her, she honestly is the love of my life. But at no point in the last 8 months, save for once, has she initiated ANYTHING sex related in person. I mean, lead me up to my bedroom and just GO. Or even just a casual ""Hey, wanna have sex?"" It just hasn't happened. I have to initiate everything, almost every time. Even then, it only works maybe once out of every 10 attempts. Last month (December)  I understand why we didn't do anything, she was really focused on school and her last few exams. Perfectly fine with that, school is your future, and that has to come first, but it's been another month. It's been just over 2 months since we've done anything. But the honest truth is, in general, I am frustrated. I feel like I'm not sexy to her anymore, even if she says I am, she doesn't show it in that way. We kiss, we hug, we grab each others asses while kissing, and we do all of that alot; but the actual sexual attraction physically of me to her, feels weak or not there. I have talked to her about it, and she said she is working on it. That she needs to get horny more often, but it really isn't often enough for me... 

At the end of the day, I am frustrated, sexually frustrated, and genuinely feel like it's my fault. I need some advice.

Now alittle bit of a disclaimer or explanation before people twist my words or understand wrong and get comments like : ""you seem like you really are pushy for sex"" or ""all you think about is sex"" or ""it only sounds like you're thinking about your own needs"" comments, I am generally a really good boyfriend. I put her first, For absolutely everything. I do everything she asks me to, I help with whatever I can, I give her space when she needs it. I don't hurt her, I dont force her to do anything she doesn't want to, and I above all else, respect the shit out of that Beautiful Woman that let's me be Hers."

relationship_advice,how do i ( 18f) ask my partner (18m) for more time together? or am i too needy / clingy?,"i’m going to try to keep this as short as i can !!
sorry if formatting is bad

&gt; also made account forgetting to start with throwra im sorry 

*** i also know we are very young, so we both have a-lot to learn and we still are growing up and developing into adults  ***

we were in an LDR for a bit and then closed the distance shortly after when i moved in with him and his family.

he works full time mon-fri but i feel like within the last month he hasnt been paying as much attention towards me like he used too ( which happens in most relationships as time goes on past a honeymoon stage ) 

he spends most of the rest of his day playing his games and i get probably an hour or so with him at night before he goes to sleep but by then he’s usually just on his phone and sleepy.

sat-sun usually ends up the same way, him playing his games and i don’t get much time with him. 
he’ll come talk to me for 5-10 minutes once or twice and then goes back to playing his games

i also don’t have any friends here, it can get very isolating and hence i feel very alone sometimes. i haven’t been able to see my best friend in a long time since she doesn’t live here / go out and do much. 

i cant tell if i’m overthinking and being too needy or clingy, i’ve just felt very alone for the last few weeks. 

i just want more time to spend with him but don’t know how to say it because he’s really enjoying his games and stuff and it makes him happy and i don’t want to be that person who makes him feel bad for playing his games / doing what he enjoys. 

plus he also pays for my board etc so i feel like i shouldn’t tell him what i want because he does so much for me already....

i guess i don’t really know what to do, i miss talking to him and spending time with him. its hard because i know he loves me and if i tell him in the wrong way he will feel very upset and disappointed in himself when it isn’t really his fault. 

this is a first for me and i honestly could do with any advice, id honestly appreciate it so much. 

thank you if you’ve read this far in i guess i just needed to talk about it as well"
relationship_advice,Does he (16M) like me? (16F),"He’s recently broken up with a toxic ex but they’re still friends and she seems flirty around him. 

We go to different schools and haven’t officially met in person yet, unless you count waving at a bus lmao

Signs he might like me:
• he checks up on me
• he asks if I’m okay/how my day’s going
• he said I’m fun to talk to
• he’s starting sending kisses after his messages after I hinted that I’m looking for a valentine

Possible barriers:
• his ex still being around
• the fact that we don’t see each other in person, however meeting up is an option since he’s only like 20 mins away

I’d list everything I like about him but I’m so infatuated honestly 🥺 this boy sings, plays piano and guitar, is kind and soso pretty,,, yeah I’m in deep hehe"
relationship_advice,"We (M31, F32) broke up because she isn’t ready for a relationship.","Hi redditors,

It would be great if you can offer some advices on what I should do or what you would do in my situation as I do think I need some help to get through this. I’ll be appreciative if you could read through the story and let me know what you think.

So a few days ago my girl told me that she is in a dilemma with either we should keep seeing each other or switch the focus back onto ourselves so she can be more independent. 
I had no idea at all that it was coming as we had been getting along so well for around 3 and a half months and had so much great time with the companies to one another. To us it was pretty much the time about to define something between us and when it came to that point, she pulled out. 

The psychological side on her is that, she had been in ‘two 7-year’ relationships previous to when she met me and the pace we were going towards stepping into our relationship kind of scared her. It was like she haven’t had enough of time to herself being ‘unowned’ and inhaling the air of independence. She is a loyal person and she felt like if she made a commitment to me, she’ll be in a relationship for another very long time or even forever, and she is not ready for that. Eventually we came down to a conclusion that we are just friends now and shouldn’t be thinking about having each other back as lovers.

I could understand where she was coming from but it hurt so much because I had no time to prepare for that and emotionally I still love her so much as I gave my all when we were still together.

Dear redditors, should I wait for her to be available again or should I just walk away? If I decide to wait for her to feel that she’s ready again, how should I do to play cool and what mindset should I be on?

Any advice would be appreciated.
Cheers"
relationship_advice,"I (28M) just found out that my partner (24F) is self-destructive and a workaholic, and I'm starting to give up","For reference, for many years I suffered from depression, it took a lot of therapy and help to get to where I am now. I don't have any incidents and, although I still struggle with it from time to time, I am no longer a danger to myself. I am happy to live.

I met my partner at work. She is sweet, and the kindest person I have ever met. However, she recently fainted at work and I got a call that she was at the hospital. I went to visit her and paid her medical bill and stayed with her all day as she was in bed-rest and undergoing numerous tests. I live in Tanzania so we thought it was just Malaria, but the doctor stated that she has not been eating (we don't live together), she has not been drinking water, and she is highly stressed.

Once the doctor left, I spoke to her and told her to take the day off work. Rest, and I would come over and cook her some nutritious food to get her energy back up. So we go to her place and she finally gets some rest and food in her. The next day I tell her NOT to go to work because she is still sick. Her boss, her colleagues, and even her family are telling her to take the day off. I imagine they must have freaked out seeing her faint and didn't want an incident. 

To my surprise, after I took a nap (I didn't sleep much that night) in the afternoon, she snuck out and went to work! I get a call from her boss asking me if I knew that she had left to work and I said no. She kept telling people she was fine. I go to the office because it's not too far away and see her working the front desk with reddened eyes and constantly coughing. As people are trying to get her out she keeps rushing back in.

Eventually I literally had to carry her out of the office with the help of two coworkers of hers. I put her in my car and we had a long talk. She is smiling the whole time thinking that it's just a game, and it made me snap. I told her that she might have a problem. She is literally compulsively working. I blamed myself for not seeing this earlier. So i begged her, I begged her to come home and to just take one day off. Her phone was full of texts from colleagues telling her NOT to come. Her family called her telling her to rest and take care of herself.

We go home and I take care of her, but then when I fell asleep at night, she woke up at 5AM! 5Am in the morning and snuck out to be the first at work. Finally after waking up and realizing what happened I went to see her at the office. I was HOPING that she was actually fine but she was in MUCH worse condition than the night before. She was NOT getting better and the doctor said if the meds didn't work in two days she would need to come back. She refused for me to take her to the hospital.

I care for her, but I -know- from my therapy that you cannot save someone that doesn't think they need saving. She is breaking my heart and I am getting depressed thinking about how I can't help her. I am worried that being with her may destroy, but leaving her would make me a horrible person. The other night I was thinking that if she is fine living like this I should just leave. Leaving would be for my sake.

I want to leave. I can't be happy with her. But...it feels wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR My partner got incredibley sick but because she is a workaholic she won't give herself a day off, and I'm tired of trying to help her when she won't listen to what me, her doctor, her employees, and even her boss says."
relationship_advice,Alone and feeling hopeless regarding relationships,I’ve watched the 40 year old virgin recently after many years and I started to see a pattern. In the movie Steve Carell says at what one point “in my 20s I started to not care/stop trying and then in my 30 I really just stoped trying” or something along those lines. I’m 26 and a virgin and never kissed a girl and never been in a relationship and I’m starting to notice that I’m doing this exact pattern of behaviour. I’ve known that some girls were actually interested in me but I’ve always manage to screw it up or appear as lacking confidence which has turned them off and sent them away and resulting in losing that opportunity. I feel at this point it’s easier and also more viable to stop trying and start focusing on life but I have that deep desire to actually go out there and have “adventures” but I just can’t seem to find a way to get there. I’m very unlucky and always manage to screw up opportunities. I seem to be stuck in a maze with no exit and not sure what to do. Any advice?
relationship_advice,"Is my guy friend (20 M), is interested in me (20 F).. I'm a little clueless lol","So my guy friend and I met a year ago at the beginning of university. I thought he was cute in a dorky, kind and gentle way. (He's extremely introverted). But I didnt act on it because I didn't think he was interested in me romantically. 

But lately since the second term started this year, I feel like something has changed with him. He's being a lot more attentive when i speak, and always jokes/ does banter with me. During our labs, he will always sit or stand beside me, and pay attention to me. (If that makes sense??)  Like for the past month, whenever we're talking it's like hes only paying full attention to what I have to say ( even if we're in a group setting). 

Also i was talking about how cold my hands were one time and he reaches out to grab my hand and see if I was okay. And we talk about how we both love making films, music we both like and share with each other. He also told me he sings love ballads lol . 

I also found out that out of our friend group, I'm the only one he talks to outside of class, so idk what that means but it seems important because hes pretty private with the rest of our friends. 

We also had a good conversation in the beginning of the second term where he told me he was worried about school and graduation.  And I was talking about internships and school / my job.It was just really nice and It felt very safe and it was an open and honest conversation. 


We just have a good dynamic and friendship, but I feel like something is different with us.  I just cant tell what it is. 

Also I dont know if this matters at all, but he's a picses and I'm a capricorn. I just have trouble navigating things like love because I dont have a lot of experience with it. Please let me know what you think!"
relationship_advice,My (21m) gf (20f) of 2 years is really insecure about her fellatio skills and no matter what I say she is really uncomfortable with doing it which means she never gets to practice.,"Let me start off by saying that I was awful at going down on my gf when we first met. She was my first non one night stand sexual partner. I made it a point to go down on her every time to practice and get to know her body. I still do it every time and I make her orgasm without fail. I've put a lot of work in but I feel that it's not getting reciprocated. She returns the favor maybe once a month and that's if we have been going at it for so long that she's starting to hurt a little. I have never gotten it without me first making her orgasm.

I think there are two reasons for this. The first one is that she is so insecure about her skills that she won't even try to get better at it. I feel like she's forgotten how bad I was in the beginning. The other reason is that she seems to think that we both put in equal amounts of work into the sex since we both orgasm about the same amount of times. This just feels like a slap in the face to me. I spend 15-30min every time we have sex to focus only on her but since I'm a guy and I blow my load a lot easier than her I don't deserve extra attention?

It just seems so disproportionate to most relationships because I know she gets head more than most girls. Hell she gets head more than most guys and guys get it a lot more than girls in general. I guess it's not even about the head. It's more about that it feels like she doesn't value the effort I put in when I know I do pretty well. 

How do I say to her that I think our sexual efforts are one sided without sounding like an asshole. I want her to be more confident in her skills and I always make sure to let her know that it feels good but she doesn't believe it's actually nice (it is)."
relationship_advice,How do I (22F) help my boyfriend (22M) with insecurities/negativity that is affecting our relationship?,"Using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my main account username.

So some background info: My boyfriend and I have been together for 6.5 years, and are generally very happy. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. We don't live together, as I'm in school and he's saving up right now and working full-time in the trade, and we're blessed to have parents that will support us.

For the past couple of months, he's been really down on himself in terms of body image, and it's been getting progressively worse. He has gained a bit of weight, but honestly I barely noticed and I love him and find him attractive no matter what. Now, he's gotten to the point he's ""completely disgusted with himself"" as he puts it. It's starting to affect our sex life- there have been a couple of times now that we've stopped (he initiated the sex) because he felt turned off by himself. I try not to take it personally, but it can be hard to not feel like it's my fault as I've had my fair share of struggles with body image (eating disorder). We talked last weekend and he expressed he hates everything about himself: how he acts, how he looks, etc. I obviously tell him how much I love him and what an amazing person he is to me but he shoots pretty much everything I saw down and can be quite hurtful. Even today, I was on my period and I mentioned that to him and he said something along the lines of ""that's okay I don't feel great about myself today/I'm not feeling sex"".

I just want to say, I have NEVER pressured him for sex, or made him feel bad in any way about stopping and have always stopped right away. During the relationship I'd say our libido is quite high, but now I feel like he's uninterested in me sexually. More importantly, I am worried about his mental health and I don't know how to help him. He is being extremely negative, and shoots down my ideas for therapy, eating plans, gym, etc. He says he's struggling with diet right now by eating junk food as comfort. I try to suggest calorie counting etc. and he says ""it doesn't work for him"" or ""he doesn't have money to buy his own healthy food"". I know he'd be happier going to the gym (he used to be quite regular for a long time) but he works a physical job with long hours and comes home tired. He complains the gym is too busy, and other gym membership rates are ""too expensive"". 

I just don't know what to say anymore- everything I do try and offer, he shoots down and/or gets angry and I feel hurt and like I've made things worse. After our talks he usually apologizes, but still. I just don't know the ""right"" thing to say anymore, or what to do (or not do...). I just want to help support him.

Thank you so much if you read this all the way through, I appreciate any help.

relationship_advice,Why is it so hard to get over my crush?,"long story short: recently when I found out that my crush was taken, I decided to stay away from him. But even after A month of not seeing him I still can’t get over him. I can’t stop thinking about him... he’s also popped up in my dreams a few times.

relationship_advice,Give me some perspective about my “friend”,"Hello, 

Long story short. My “best friend” asked me to be her MOH for her wedding but fired me to be a bridesmaid because I couldn’t make it to her bridal shower (I had a Saturday class in a very rigorous nursing program and can’t miss more than one class which I was saving up to attend her wedding). So, she fired me. A little upsetting but that’s fine. The bachelorette party took place Friday to Sunday but I obviously couldn’t make it to the first day/ night because I had class so I managed to fly myself to the party so I can at least attend the second half of it. After the bridal shower and bachelorette party, she posted pictures on her social media and tagged and thanked the other girls for planning and for the wonderful shower and bach party except me. I helped plan and paid for respective events. And there was this whole bitterness about me picking up my dress from her which I don’t want to get into. 

Now comes the wedding. Wedding was good and was actually happy that I was a part of it. The night of the wedding, I sent her a thank you message for letting me be part of her bridal shower and hope that she had fun and got home safe and yada yada. No response from her. I thought maybe she’s too full of happy emotions, she could care less of messages so I let it go. Still no response or nothing when I was so called her best friend. It’s been a few months since the wedding and we haven’t talked at all nor do I feel like reaching out to her (we’ve had several downfalls and I was always the one to apologize and reach out first). 

The sad part is... we have a mutual acquaintance. Let’s call her Lucy. Lucy is my friend and I introduced her to the bride friend while she was in school because she needed more clients for her clinical. Well, I was hanging out with Lucy and told me that bride friend was traveling a lot for her honeymoon. I was not aware of this. In conclusion, bride friend blocked me from seeing her insta stories but is still friends with me on social media. It sounds really petty but I’m just wondering what is going through her mind about her decision to do this. Should I just unfriend her on everything? 

Wow, sorry that it was a bit long!!! Thought it’d be short. Thank you for reading if you’ve made it all the way here =)"
relationship_advice,How do I (35F) get my dad (M65) who I haven't seen in 20 years to back off?,"My parents split up when I was 11. There was fault on both sides, as well as my mother's family never approving of my father. It was a lot of pressure on him so I never harbored resentment or blamed him, even when he disappeared and I never saw him again for over 20 years.

Recently I tracked him down and tried to clear up some lingering questions and do some family tree research. We corresponded over email for a few weeks before meeting in person. He cried and told me how happy he was to see me. The next meeting he asked if I wanted us to have a relationship and be in each other's lives and I said yes. He insisted that he didn't want to ""live in your pocket"" but he wanted to be a part of my life, get to know me, meet my partner, etc. My partner and I had lunch at my father's home the next meeting. My dad was so nervous his hands were shaking that time but everything was fine.

Except now he is bombarding me with multiple texts every single day. Asking what I'm doing, where I am, what are my plans, etc. He wants to call and chat all the time and meet, too. If I don't respond he sends more texts wanting to know why so I told him once that I actively try to use my phone as little as possible but he still didn't change his behavior. He's pushing to come to my home and I'm not comfortable with that yet. I know he is excited and possibly lonely but I am feeling smothered. I have my own life. I am a bit introverted and the pressure of always having to respond and make conversation is making me dread the thought of his next message. I've already had one panic attack. As time goes by I am also starting to feel a bit of resentment at his attitude. Why didn't he try and find us once he knew we were adults and less influenced by my mother's family? Why was it up to ME to find HIM? That sort of thing. I feel guilty because I'm essentially the one who barged into his life but now I'm having regrets and that makes me feel awful. But I don't know if he is behaving normally and I'm overreacting or if my wanting some space is legitimate. We are very different people. He is one of those super positive, high energy salesmen who talk over you, tell endless stories about their lives, and insist they know how everyone else should live based on their 'life experience.' I am more reserved, a bit cynical but with an overall chilled out approach to life, and am very independent and happy in my own company with my own projects and don't need or want him trying to ""father"" me.

How should I convey this without hurting his feelings?"
relationship_advice,I am losing my bestfriend/girlfriend over my impulsive attitude,"So this issue started a few months ago we've been together for 2 years she's 20 and I am 22. We met in college but I live out of state, for personal reasons I traveled to come see my family for thanksgiving and Christmas but have had an extended stay due to my friend having 2 failing kidneys and a heart tumor as well as my mom being I'll from cancer. We had established that the key to our success when away from long distance is communication but she's been so busy with working two jobs that we never spoke and no one wanted to assume responsibility and initiate conversation so we went on not speaking. As I can only attest to my side I started doing more and more reckless things to try and receive some sort of empathy from her (because I was literally crying myself to sleep every night),  I started doing drugs and drinking the whole kit and caboodle. Which only lead to my own demise when she told me that it's not her fault that I'm doing self harm. That kinda had me shaken up so I decided to call things off because I just wasn't happy anymore. But after I called things off  she starts talking to me again consistently every day so we got back together briefly and she stopped talking to me as soon as I said we should get together. And then I broke it off with her in a more serious matter got into an argument recently and I said some very regretful things I wish I had not now she wants to know part of me but still loves me?

At  the moment I'm just not sure what to do I don't want to be with anybody else but also understand that I have to respect her feelings. I know what needs to happen I just would like to do this entire time because I wanted to prove a point. But now I just want to make sure she's happy even if it means we're not together I still want to be friends with her I'm okay with that. I know I've messed up and I can admit to defeat but I also know how to catch myself when I've fallen and I've made a complete 180

I guess my question is how do I ensure her happiness without causing anymore grief. I know taking to her casually will make her happier and help her think  clearly but I tried tonight and she said I doesn't wanna get back together. Which had nothing to do with anything I was saying in the first place

TL;DR 
My ex and I broke up got into a fight and I decided that if she wants to think I'm the bad guy then I'll be bad. Tried to make her cry (I regret it EXTREMELY) and now I just want to make sure she's happy. I'm alright being friends if it means she's happy everyday again but we still love each other. 

Not sure if being friends until I return from my trip home is smart or if I should not talk to her ever again... Or should I push through and make her smile no matter what? Any advice will be appreciated thanks in advance!"
relationship_advice,My (ex) wife is dating again...and I don't know how to cope or move on,"I'm a scum bag... The biggest piece of shit you will ever meet. I cheated on my wife while I was on a work trip, almost a year ago.

We have 3 kids together and our youngest was 7 months at the time. I have no excuses for why I cheated, she is an amazing women and everything I ever wanted in a partner. Smart, funny, sexy as hell, hardworking, fun, similar interest, an amazing mother and my best friend. I love her with all my heart and am tearing up just writting this.

We were together for 9 years.... She pulled me from a dark place when we met and for the first time in my life I found someone who genuinely loved me..... And I fucked it up by getting too drunk and making one poor decision. I was ashamed and instantly knew that if I told her she would leave me. I was a coward and convinced myself it would never happen again and that I would live with the guilt, and be a better husband. 

She found out from a co-worker and that was it. I broke her heart and I can still see the look on her face when she asked me why and I didn't have an answer. I lost my family and my life...

I went to pick up my kids a few weeks ago and saw she was dressed up, she looked beautiful. I told her she looked nice and she smiled and said she had a date.... 

I saw them together today and it just feels like the day she left me all over again. I feel...crazy and sick to my stomach. I can't concentrate and I keep feeling the need to call her or text her or go over to the house.... The thought of him with my wife....touching her, being with her, I feel lost and hatred towards myself... 

How do I get over this? Will I get over this? I spent months with suicidal thoughts and was doing somewhat fine with my therapist, knowing I could never do something like that to my kids... But now I feel it again.

I fucked up, I lost the best thing that will ever happen to me, and now she moving on and I don't know where to even begin...."
relationship_advice,My (23) ex boyfriend (22) flaked on our first date as bf/gf to go to Disneyland with one of his friend that is a female. When I confronted him he said that he was taking her out to get over a break up. Am I over reacting??,"Our first date was supposed to be on a saturday, but at the last mintue he canceled and said that he couldnt make it. His reasoning was that something came up and that he was busy. So I rescheduled the date. 

Later I found out on his instagram story that he went to Disneyland with some girl. I felt horrible becuase they were looking like they were having the time of their life.

I was waiting for him to bring it up but he never did so I brought up so I decided to talk about it.
When I confronted him, he said that it was to help the girl get over a recent break up by taking her to Disneyland. 

Is going to Disneyland with the opposite gender solo werid? Am I overacting over the fact that he didnt tell me??

relationship_advice,Am I (23F) too judgmental of my friend?(27F),"I’ve known Caroline(27F) for two years. She used to be an addict and in and out of rehab for years. She used to do heroin and drink every day of the week. She works part-time and has a trust fund to support her. She’s 27 years old. She started smoking weed again at. First, I didn’t comment, but during the summer, she quit her job because it was too stressful and doing nothing but smoking. I tried to show my concern then, but she shifted blame, saying I’m cheap about gas money and don’t know what I’m talking about. 




That was around my birthday, and she ignored me on my birthday. She got a job again, so that’s good.
Caroline told me she'd not going to AA anymore because it's a ”Christian cult” I just said something like talk to other people about it and saw their opinion, and she got all defensive and was like ”i don't need others opinions only my therapist and me make that call I've been hundreds of meetings I don't relate I'm not a real alcoholic.”



I was trying to say maybe try different meetings or see what other people think, but I didn't disagree like ”oh no, you need to go to meetings” because I know that's not always the answer. It's hard to know what to say because sometimes I feel crazy like ”am I being rude” because she says I'm blunt, but I think I try to be sensitive to other people



. So back on the Fourth of July, Caroline drank a couple of drinks but was doing AA. She didn’t tell her sponsors but still went to meetings till like November.


Now she’s saying she’s not an alcoholic cause she can stop after a couple of drinks and her therapist says she’s not an alcoholic. She drank on New Year and had a drink with her aunt yesterday, but always is like, “I don’t have that much. I only have a sip,” which isn’t valid cause I saw her on the fourth.


Like I’m just worried like I haven’t been drinking, but I don’t do AA, and I think she thinks she can do what I do. But like she’s gone to treatment/wilderness a couple of times and is still smoking a lot of weed.

So not sure what to do because I feel very uncomfortable when she says she was never an alcoholic or she’s not one. I kinda have to sit there and be like, “yeah.”



I don’t know, do I sound like I was too judgemental IDK how to handle that? Why is she so mad at me? Am I too blunt?"
relationship_advice,How to be normal,"So I used to smoke more than 7 times a day, thats all I would do for about 3 years, smoke, make music, play videogames. Its been a month since I stopped and I realized that I really dont know what sober people do to have fun tbh. I wanna get to know this girl I just dont know what would be fun to do or where to invite her. I never went out as a kid either, i always stayed home for the most part aside from the occasional movies every-once in a while."
relationship_advice,Long Distance Advice,"So, I’m a 23 year old guy who is in a long distance relationship with my 22 year old girlfriend. This is my first time dating someone from long distance. I’m pretty well off, nice paying job, and I have some family benefits when finding nice places to stay, so seeing her isn’t too expensive, and I can easily afford to see her often. We’ve been together for about a year, however have only visited her twice, since I didn’t have my job at the time, so now by celebrating I thought of seeing her for Valentines Day weekend, so she agreed. We’ve had a disagreement recently though, that’s kinda been a sketchy topic to discuss. 

She’s been friends with a guy for 5-6 years, and he also has plans to see her. I assumed it was the same state or something, and I thought sure, I didn’t know why she was asking for permission to see her friends, but I appreciated the honesty. She then told me that he’s flying in, and I was somewhat taken aback. Basically, the story is he apparently has “work training” and happens to be going to the city she lives in. They’ve been friends online for 5-6 years, so it’s been a long time. I have no interest in trying to control her actions, but it does seem weird to me, that out of all the cities and states in this country, the training is where she is. She told me she’d probably be busy those 2 days he’s there. He comes around March, so much later than my visit.  She has assured me that he’s engaged and gets married this month, and sure, that could be true, but I know nothing about him, and marriage doesn’t necessarily mean it’s impossible to cheat. She told me the plan is to get dinner both nights, since he’s busy till 5pm both days. She’d most likely have to pick him up from his hotel room, which is also throwing me off a bit. I told her I was okay with the visit as long as she gave me updates here and there as it’d make me feel better, but I’m still kinda bothered. It all seems too.. coincidental, but I don’t feel like controlling what she should do would be right of me.

Am I overthinking this? Or is there anything I can say that may help the situation?"
relationship_advice,Do I try to make it down for Valentine’s Day?,"My fiancé moved for work 2 days after we got engaged. He’s doing a post doc research position meaning he’s essentially working 11+ hour days(told my mom when I come down he’ll still be working that much but will do some of it at home to be with me) and sometimes(like last night) he pulls all nighters. 

I needed to get my license so I’ve been working on that before I move with him. 

I have my test scheduled for next Saturday. I wanted to move by Valentine’s Day so I could spend it with him. 

My parents want to come with me and help me move/find me a car. 

Today my sister texts me asking when my test is and how she wants to do a 60th surprise birthday party for my aunt. She then proceeds to tell me she told my aunt my test was the 15th and we should celebrate with dinner(an excuse to surprise my aunt).

After that my sister asked if I was planning on going down the 15th. Part of me feels like it’ll be too much work to try to get down for Valentine’s Day(and we’d be spending it with my parents) and that it’d be nice to celebrate my aunts 60th(she’s been really close with me)

But part of me wants to spend Valentine’s Day together as it’s our first one as an engaged couple."
relationship_advice,Ex-girlfriend moving on after four days,"Good evening.  I don't know if this qualifies for this subreddit, as the relationship is over. If there were to be any issues i accept responsibility 
My name is Ander. I just ended a year and a half long LDR with the most wonderful person I have ever known.  We were not good for eachother. And i always had big issues with my lack of honesty and my great insecurities.  That eventually led to her having had enough.  I was a horrible boyfriend and i lost her. I can't change that no matter what and i can't blame her 
But i did find out she started talking to other guys thru a dating app just three days after we stopped talking.  Apparently she's having a reasonably good time at it.. part of me accepts she's just on her way to moving on and that's a good thing but another is hurt that it's happening so quickly after 16 months of relationship that also provided both of us with very happy moments..
I did love her more than I have ever loved anyone and i still do. My mind is full of regrets and what ifs..
Am i wrong to be hurt that my ex-girlfriend is moving on so quickly? I know there is nothing i can do either way.. but i want to know if the pain is justified"
relationship_advice,AITA for wanting my fiancé to skip the gym to meet a dog I want to adopt,"Now context. We have lots of animals at this house, but only three cats are mine and my wolf dog passed away from age. We are moving when he is deployed, and I really want a guard dog/ lil best friend I get to cuddle when he’s gone, which he gets and he says I will get a dog when it’s time and we find the right one. But I only see him on weekends and he gets here around 4-6 pm on Friday’s because he naps and then goes to the gym. I was hoping he’d skip the gym (he skipped last week to go with me but he napped first and napped longer than usual so we couldn’t get there in time because it’s an hour away) I asked him if tomorrow we could go and he could skip his nap and gym,  but he says it’s unfair to him etc. I love him with my whole heart and I usually get yes as an answer all the time with small things. I just really want to know if me asking him and... well pretty much begging him to go with me tomorrow because it’ll technically be our dog together, if he’d skip his nap and gym and come home to go look at him. (Takes him 50 min to get home)  ALSO, this dog is a German Shepard that was left abandoned in a motel room with not much love, and I am a very sympathetic person to animals so maybe I am making a mountain out of a mole hill. Opinions ?"
relationship_advice,Am I being selfish and insensitive to my BF’s culture?,"My bf(28M) and I (25F) have been dating for almost 2 years, and have been friends for more than double that. 

Recently, something came up that I thought we were on the same page about, but it appears that I may be wrong.

Before dating, he and I had talked about what our future living situations would ideally be like, I’ve always dreamed of owning my own home, where as he planned to take over the bills of his parents home, and live there with them and his brother. He is of a different culture than myself, and I believe that there is some sort of expectation to take care of your parents more so than in my own culture. 

Early in the relationship, I let him know that I would be very uncomfortable at the thought of staying in the same home as his parents (currently in their early 50s and have more of a social life than myself) and fronting the bills. I made a compromise that we could get our own home, and then move them into that home after we have kids.
He seemed to agree with this, as conversations since then have been along the lines of “when I move out/when we get our own place,”ect. I do want to point out that I tend to be opinionated and assume that he agrees, because he doesn’t say otherwise.

However recently, he stated that once he gets a career (we are both in school but getting close to finishing) that he would start by giving them half of his paychecks to cover the mortgage. After asking a few questions, it seems that somehow his plan has gone back to his original plan. He even stated that perhaps we could get an apartment and wait until they pass and we could move into the home. I asked him about my dreams of having kids and dogs and my own home, and he claims that we could have all of that in his parents home.

His parents have worked extremely hard for everything they have, and they have certain styles and tastes. They are very healthy and go to parties and host parties all the time. I just don’t see myself ever truly feeling like it’s my home in that setting while they are still social and independent. 

Does anyone have any advice on this situation? Or perhaps some insight on how you handle caring for your SOs parents? This is one thing that I feel if I caved I would be giving up so many dreams, but at the same time, if this is what is culturally expected, how can I ask him not to?"
relationship_advice,I used to have a crush and it won't go away,"I had a really big crush on this girl last year but I never talked with her because I am super shy and self conscious, I don't know what to do because I still have a crush on her a year later and although it's weaker it's still there. Talking to her isn't really an option because again, I'm super shy"
relationship_advice,I feel tricked,"So fair warning in advance - this post will be somewhat political due to the argument between me and my partner being so, I'm personally not here to make a huge discussion based on my own views or my boyfriends, anyone reading this is welcome to agree with the views of either one of us as it isnt the views that matter exactly.

So, me and my boyfriend got into the discussion of what it really means to be 'radical/far left' after I saw another post on reddit making the suggestion that, in America specifically, the far and radical left do not really exist, and the likes of Warren, Sanders and even Obama are, at most, centre left on the basis of their political views.

I found this interesting as my boyfriend personally feels like far left radicalism is a huge problem in not just America, but all over the world.

After a bit of discussion, several points agreed with and several where we seemed to be able to civilly disagree with - we moved onto terrorism at the request of my boyfriend. Now, I like wikipedia for my sources personally, my boyfriend strongly does not, I am fully aware that 'liars' can edit these wiki pages which is why I always find a second and sometimes even a third source before believing anything at face value.

What I clicked on was the following wikipedia page - 'Left-wing and anti-government extremism'.
This is what I pressed on, yes.
But the wikipedia page which loaded was 'Terrorism in the United States'.

I was initially confused, because the link didn't look as if it were a subcategory within another article, and I just kind of started at the screen for a second before saying to my boyfriend something along the lines of 'but... were only looking for left wing terrorism specifically'.

He screamed at me that this page was the page for left wing terrorism, noting as usual how stupid I am.
I knew this wasn't correct... I was sure of it.

I tried to scroll through looking for a sub category, there has to be one I thought?

He yanked the mouse off me and opened up multiple terrorist incidents by date citing they were left wing, he made me read about a man's suicide twice. 

He knows this sort of reading material risks upsetting me no matter whether the act was committed by a right winger, a left winger, a white man, a black man, a woman, a child... it upsets me reading about people dying and I didn't require those details. I don't need to know the names of the victims of left wing terrorism, I don't need to hear how they ran for their lives and failed in getting away. It upsets me. I wanted to know simply how many incidents of left wing terrorism there has been. A number would have sufficed.

My boyfriend has repeatedly told me how stupid I am and how I am unable to read properly.
This has been... a very huge part of our relationship. I am not dyslexic, I did very well in my English exams, reading aloud is not my strong point but, to myself, I can read pretty fast... It has reached the stage where it would be odd for him to not call me these things.

I began crying throughout the above argument, due to frankly taking in too many names and faces of the now deceased and being sure that no way is far leftist such a prevalent issue, I was horrified with myself for letting myself be tricked by these leftists. They are murderers of thousands of innocents!?

Only... no they are not. After I accidentally rolled forward in my desk chair too fast to try once again to get back the mouse to scroll down and find the actual left wing terrorism incidents, I accidentally rolled over my boyfriends foot. I apologised quickly, but he flipped my chair with me still in it, causing me to hit my head off the serving hatch beside the desk.

I left the room, very shaken.

With my mobile in hand, I repeated my movements. I googled the same thing, found the same wikipedia page, scrolled down and upsettingly found the far left terrorism section. I was upset at this stage because of how easy it was, to just scroll down and find what we were looking for from the start.

And then I realised... this has happened so many times before. My boyfriend screaming at me 'this is what you're looking for! Are you stupid?! Can you not read?! It is right here for fuck sake! Why are you SO dumb?!'.

I don't know what he's showing me though! He says it is one thing, but this is not the first time I've found out afterwards that he was twisting information to make himself right and more importantly, so he could remind me of how stupid I am and how I cannot read and now my sources are all liars and how intelligent he is.

I'm so tired."

Situation with my friend (Jeremy 26M), we've been group friends for a few years and after graduating university a year ago, we've grown more as one on one friends. I've always found Jeremy attractive, but never thought we'd work out. We might have dated once, but I jumped ship and dated someone else. I'm flying out to visit in a few weeks and want to maintain our friendship, but I'm worried I might slip up and makes things awkward or uncomfortable. I still don't think us dating would be good and I don't want horny brain to fuck up a friendship. How to I balance it and not be uptight the entire trip?

My coworker, Fred (25M), has a girlfriend, so obviously I don't want to push a romantic thing at all, but I find myself slipping into actions or thoughts that might promote or be percieved as romantic.

relationship_advice,Is being a gold digger and being spoiled by boyfriend the same?,"I have the best boyfriend in the world. I m very much loved, cherished and spoiled by him. This is such a blessing because despite meeting many men and dating several of them in the past, nobody loved me truly. And some even treated me rather terribly. 
But he is truly special because we love each other so much and he's such a good man. He's honest, loyal, respectful and funny. 

The past 2 years I was with him, I was a full time student with low income. So I barely had enough for luxury and travelling. 
There were times I needed money for things but could not pay for them. 
He always made sure I got what I needed. And he spoils me a lot with flowers,gifts and dinner here and there. Buying me the latest phone because I needed it. And took me for holidays overseas. 

Somehow people get this idea that I m gold digging. 
We are in 2 years committed relationship. I don't give him sex in return for gifts. I cook for him when I am free and he is more than thankful for it. Hahaha. Also we will have a joint saving account for a house soon after I start working this week."
relationship_advice,Should I ask this girl out? I have no clue what I’m doing and want other (more experienced) people’s input.,"Apologies for bad formatting; I’m on mobile.

First some context. I (16M) am finishing up requirements for my driving school. One of the requirements to get your license is driving with an instructor for an hour at a time, switching with another student, and they drive for an hour.  You have to do this multiple times. Also, students are required to be there for the “sitting in the back of the car” part. This means if you can’t do that, you have to make it up later. I was going to drive during one of these things. It turned out 2 other students needed to make up time and would be joining us. One of them is the girl I’m talking about.

I was going to drive second, and the girl didn’t want to sit in the middle seat so she asked if I could, so I said sure. So we’re at a point where I’m in a car between a guy and a girl I’d never met before. None of us knew each other. After a few minutes, we start talking. We talk about random stuff just to pass the time. The girl and I actually go to the same school and are in the game grade, we just don’t have any classes together so we haven’t met. The other boy sitting in the back with us is homeschooled. 

Randomly, this dude asks us “hey do you guys have instagrams?” and we all follow each other on Instagram (this is important later). I thought it was weird but whatever. The girl and I talk about school for a bit. We all talk about random stuff for the rest of the hour, and after it’s over, the girl and other guy sitting with me leave because they only needed to make up 1 hour.

Later that night, I realized I enjoyed talking to her. She was easy to talk to, nice, etc.. I had her Instagram so I figured “why not message her, I liked talking to her” and so I do. Keep in mind this is VERY unusual for me. I’m super introverted, I’ve never asked a girl out, never dated a girl, never had one ask me out, or anything of the sort. Not because I wasn’t interested, but because I was shy or guessed they weren’t interested in me. For some reason, though, I wanted to make a move on this girl.

I open it up by talking about how weird it was that the other boy sitting next to us asked us for our instagrams out of nowhere. I guessed it was something she could relate to and was the only reason I could come up with to message her without looking like a complete weirdo. We talk about driving mostly, along with some small random stuff. It was a very short conversation but it didn’t seem like she was uninterested in messaging me back or anything. I ended the conversation because I didn’t really have anything else to say and I didn’t think she did either. I said “I’ll see you around school” and she said “ya for sure.” I also had to do some schoolwork.

I made a move but I don’t know what to do now. I don’t have any classes with her, never see her in the hallways, or anything. The only way I can really talk to her is by messaging her on Instagram and I have nothing to talk to her about. I was thinking about straight up asking her out over messaging but figured that’d be weird so I came here for advice. Should I just ask her out? If so, where should two teens who have no clue what they’re doing go (I’m assuming she hasn’t dated much but obviously I can’t say for sure)? Should I try to keep messaging her? Message her about what? Or should I just give up on this all together?

I didn’t talk to her much, I don’t know that much about her, and I have no easy way to keep the conversation going. But I hope I can somehow. Keep in mind this whole “messaging thing” happened yesterday. It will be 2 days ago by the time I wake up and read replies. Is this weird? I honestly have no idea if I’m pursuing this too much or not enough or anything. I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing. I’m just a guy who knows it felt nice to talk to a girl who actually wanted to listen. If you decide to respond and give me any advice, thank you.

TL;DR: I’m interested in a girl I met from driving school. It turns out we go to the same school and are in the same grade. We exchanged messages through Instagram and I was thinking about asking her out but I really don’t know what to do. We’ve never met or talked before and only talked for about an hour including the car ride and Instagram messaging. Thanks for any advice."
relationship_advice,My friend (19M) recently told me (19M) that he has been going out late at night to harm people in the streets,"I apologize in advance because English isn’t my first language.

After this university semester, I came to my home town to visit family and friends. One of my friends, we’ll call him John, is very close to me. We’ve known each other for 5 years now, since high school. John is like a brother to me.

Ever since I moved to another state to go to university, we text regularly to catch up on stuff. So, when I got back to town, we quickly scheduled something to see each other. John invited me to his grandparents’ house.

When I got there, we sat in the living room to watch tv and talk. Pretty normal stuff. Then, It got pretty late and his grandparents went to bed. The conversation got more personal, I started to talk about how the university was very psychologically demanding to me, etc. Then, John said he had something very personal to say. I was like “ok, I’m hearing”.

He said he was going out late at night to beat people up (people he considered bad, like drug addicts, thieves, etc.  They’re very common in the suburbs here). John told me he always covered his face and brought something to defend himself with (like a knife). He said he “never felt more alive” and “was doing justice with his hands”. He also said that it was a way of letting his emotions out (?).

I thought It was just a joke and started to laugh, but he didn’t laugh back. Then I was just in shock. I couldn’t ask for how much time he has been doing it. If he hurt someone badly. I was just terrified and created an excuse to leave. I got home, panicked and cried a lot because of what John told me. He never seemed like an aggressive guy and I couldn’t believe what he said he was doing. Then he sent me some photos of the mask he used, some kind of hunting knife he had and something that looked like a makeshift spear (his bedroom was in the background so it couldn’t be fake).

Some info about him: John was always a very reserved and laid back guy. He is kind to everyone around him but rarely expresses his emotions unless you really ask him about it. His house was invaded by thieves once and they took almost everything, so I can understand his hate for this kind of people (but it doesn’t justify what he is doing). He was never an aggressive person.

As his friend, I’m so fucking worried and scared at the same time. John means a lot to me, but now it looks like I never really knew him. This situation as a whole is just insane. Apparently John is doing this because he feels its justice and because he feels good. I feel like he’s acting like some kind of psychopath. He needs to seek help on how to deal with his feelings and these aggressive tendencies (that apparently came out of nowhere).

I don’t know what to do. Should I try to talk him out of this? If he cares about our friendship, he will consider my worries, right? I feel like contacting his family will just make things worse. Should I just walk away?

I wish this was just an edgy teenager situation, but the guy is really hurting other people and I am just freaked out. Please help.

TL;DR: My friend that never showed aggressive tendencies recently told me that he has been going out at night to beat up people he considers “bad”, like drug addicts."
relationship_advice,My (m22) girlfriend (f22) gets extremely insecure over comments I made a long time ago,"My (22M) girlfriend (F22) gets extremely insecure over things I’ve said in the past

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years now. We adore each other and have discussed marriage with certainty and want to spend our lives together. 

She is the first serious girlfriend I have ever had, and vice versa. So when we started dating, it was a new experience for both of us. Long story short, I said a few things such as commenting on how hot some girl on game of thrones was one time, or that I thought one of our classmates was pretty. Totally shitty things to say in hindsight and I Own up to it. I was not aware at the time how insecure she was. 

Now, nearly three years later, I would never say anything of the sort. I love her to death and do not want, or quite frankly even notice anyone else. However, whenever we watch a show and a male character does or says something shitty, she always gets upset and reminds me of those comments I made years ago. It just feels a bit unfair to me. I’ve proven that I am more than committed to her and it feels like when she gets upset she hangs this over my head 

I know this is a different subreddit but am I the asshole?"
relationship_advice,I’m (21f) really starting to resent my bf (20m) of nearly 2 years.,"Really sorry in advance for ranting and having a long ass post. 

My boyfriend and I are coming on our 2 year anniversary in March. I want to start by saying the only reason I’m still in this relationship is because I love him and part of me is afraid to be alone. 

When we started dating, he was failing out of college and I was taking a year off from school. We met on tinder (yes, i know) but hit it off immediately. We connected over our mental illnesses (I was diagnosed with BPD but have been going to therapy, he thought he had BPD but was never diagnosed, later he was just diagnosed with GAD and clinical depression). The early part of our relationship was super intense with almost no boundaries. We said I love you after a week. He moved in with me (at my parents house) after his first year of college was over just a few months later (partly because he had nowhere to go since his parents told him he couldn’t move in with them). 

I was blinded by love in the beginning. I also still had symptoms of my borderline personality disorder, one of which being fear of abandonment. I also think I just needed someone there for me. It was a very lonely time in my life. I had just tried to commit suicide a couple months before and went through a few other traumatic events. At first my boyfriend was understanding and I felt like I could tell him anything. 

There were a few red flags early on. A few times he looked through my phone and hated my best friend at the time because she would encourage me to meet guys on tinder and hook up with them (when i was single). One time he looked through my phone after figuring out my new password and found that I hadn’t told him about this one experience I had that I told her. He was furious and basically gave me an ultimatum: her or him. I chose to cut her off. And since then I haven’t had many other good friendships with really anyone. 

After he failed his first year of college he said he was taking a year off. Okay, no problem. I took a year off too. I went back to school after a year, and I do think part of it was him who helped push me to apply and get into the field I wanted to go into. And I’m so glad he did help me go back because now I’m about to graduate in the fall with a bachelors and I have a job lined up. But it is the 2nd year he’s took off and he keeps saying every semester that he’ll go back. When it comes time to apply, he says that he’ll just get in next semester. I don’t want to support us both to move out of my parents house when I finally get a good paying job. I want him to at least work toward something, because he is pretty smart and keeps saying he wants to go back. 

He has been working full time but is horrible about saving money. He’s very impulsive with spending and he will always want to buy something new when he gets money in his account. He makes near minimum wage yet has bought a brand new tv, apple watch, ps4 controller, expensive sneakers in the past 2 months and orders food all the time. I think it’s because my parents don’t make him pay rent. But he doesn’t always need the newest greatest thing, especially when we have a working tv and working ps4 controller. 

Part of me is upset that he doesn’t save money because he doesn’t have a license or car. I drive him to work, home, and everywhere we go together. He has a permit but won’t drive with me when I offer. I thought by now, he would save up to get a car and take his driving test. He also started working retail recently and doesn’t make as much as he did at a restaurant with tips, but he hated the restaurant. He still spends money like he still works in the restaurant and asks me to send him some money here and there before he gets his next paycheck. 

I think he is also very addicted to weed. We have both smoked quite frequently in the time that we’ve been dating but it does affect him differently. I don’t need to be high all day everyday to get through life, and he treats weed like he does need that. He’s gone to an addiction counselor but he has not quit yet. 

I also get pretty upset that he doesn’t help me with cleaning. We have to share a pretty small bedroom and have a ton of laundry that’s always dirty and our room is always messy. It’s gotten to a point where I will not sleep in there sometimes because of the amount of trash he leaves around. In my entire life my room has never been as messy as it has been the past year. He will leave empty wrappers and stuff on the floor that gets crumbs everywhere. We let laundry pile up in the corners of the room until I can’t stand it and try to get a lot of it done in one day. He never does laundry unless he needs a load for work. He does help with picking up sometimes but it’s always on his time. If I ask him to help me clean, he tells me he’s too high or doesn’t want to until later. And later usually means 2 days or until I ask him again. 

Another thing that would bother me is how judgmental he can be. He will criticize me or put me down without realizing it. He’s also the worst backseat driver i’ve ever know then gets mad when I say that he doesn’t even have a license yet. If he says something judgmental and I take it personally he says it was a joke and I’m being too sensitive. I used to get upset by this but now I don’t even care because i’m used to it. 

At this point, we constantly bicker and fight. In the beginning of our fighting, I used to get so anxious and just apologize like crazy when he would tell me everything I was doing wrong. But at this point i’m so fucking tired. I fight back. I get into defensive moods almost immediately around him. We both add fuel to the fire and sometimes it will turn into a screaming match (if my parents aren’t around). He calls me names. We’ve been fighting so much in the past year that this relationship isn’t enjoyable. I feel like i’d rather spend time alone than hang out with him. He has really bad anger management issues sometimes. 

Another thing is sex. I used to want to have sex a good amount (almost every day) but now we have sex less and less. For a while he would get pissed if I was not doing something immediately right, like if i kissed him in the wrong way. Sex stopped being so enjoyable for me a long time ago. And he doesn’t like it, but I just don’t feel close to him anymore to want that. He says I should want to have sex but I really don’t feel it. Sometimes he’ll just get mad if I say I don’t want to like “you never want to.”

I’ve tried to break up with him a few times over the year but he’ll just cry and make me feel kinda shitty about it. He’ll ask for another chance and we will sit down and have a conversation about why i’m unhappy and he’ll promise he’s gonna work on it and change his ways because he loves me. And this always gets me. I always agree and I don’t know why. I feel horrible. I know breaking up will hurt for a long time but I keep thinking that I can’t be with him forever. I keep thinking “do i really want to spend my life with him? I could do better.” And the last time I tried to break up with him was about a week ago. After we talked he agreed to see a couples counselor with me and he said he would work on everything I pointed out. But since then he’s been fighting me still and I haven’t seen much of a change in his behavior. I feel like part of it is my fault because I keep bickering with him and add fuel to the fire. But i’m so sick of feeling alone in my relationship. And i’m stating to not see a future with him. 

I’m sorry for posting my whole life story, but I am at a loss. I think I love him, not as much as I once did, but i still do. I think that’s why it’s hard to cut him loose. But at the same time I don’t want to stay in a relationship if he’s not going to change and if he’s not going to put in the work that i think he needs to. He’s going to therapy for his mental health and i am not anymore. I got treated a while ago and for most areas of my life, i’m content. I may start going again to talk about this relationship because every sign is pointing to end things but I can’t bring myself to follow through for good. 

If you read this much, thank you. I feel like I also need to get some of it off my chest since I don’t have many other people to talk to in my life."
relationship_advice,I [F21] am faking orgasms for my boyfriend [22] and I don’t know if I should stop.,"Note to mods: throwRA but I was going to post on some women’s boards as well. 

We’ve been dating for a little over two years now, and I started with the mindset that faking orgasms was trashy and not something you do with a person you love. The first year and a half was pretty abysmal for us sexually — I really tried to loosen up and ‘get there’ but, no matter how good he was, I couldn’t. We work wonderfully together in all other areas, but I think this left him feeling a bit guilty. We are both in our last years of school and were only seeing each other once a week at that point. 

It’s important to note that I am very high libido and can get off on my own no problem, though I’ve never “been given” an orgasm by another partner. I find my boyfriend super attractive, and he’s doing the right things, I just. Can’t. Get. There. 

So I started faking. He has no idea. But since I have, our sex has gotten so much better it’s honestly unreal. He’s a lot more confident and willing to try fun things like scenarios, positions, etc. I’m enjoying myself a lot more too, though I still can’t come and honestly don’t even think about trying to get there during sex anymore. The best part is our non-sexual relationship components are revitalized too! And we’re making way more time for each other and I’ve never been happier. 

Repeated lying in relationships is bad, without a doubt. That’s why I need advice — even though it’s brought a lot of positives, do I owe it to him to tell him? Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if he broke up with me, though I’d be a wreck. I just don’t know what to do."
relationship_advice,Relationship trouble : Best friend or Girlfriend,"20M here, out here on a small trouble.

Currently dating a girl who was once roommate/BFF to my girl bestfriend. I'll not take much of your time, just go through their characterc sketches and help me out.

My girl bestfriend: Very friendly, sociable and indeed very much busy due to socializing. Career oriented, a little calculated in every move she makes, appears cold hearted but really isn't. She was with me for 3 years now, I met her when she was in trouble and we were there for each other ever since, not in a romantic way but as 'siblings'(We're not really siblings or cousins, we're university friends). She had a roommate (my girlfriend) who had a very troublesome and abusive relationship with her ex. My bestfriend gave her emotional support and got her out of that mess and stayed with her till she got better. But then, my best friend socialising more in the univ. got my girlfriend insecure and hatred on my bestfriend.

My girlfriend: suffered an abusive relationship, ex was a jerk to her. she never thought she'd date again. But I met her through my bestfriend, we dated for a month. Then she left both me and my bestfriend, thinking we both are cold hearted, manipulative people. But then, even after 2 years, seeing me not able to move on got her thinking. She wanted another shot at the relationship, which I was ready to.
But whenever the topic of my bestfriend comes in between, she just loses it. You can only imagine how deadly she becomes when my bestfriend's name comes up.

Incident: My bestfriend and I decided to meet one evening, she couldn't come due to some urgent work. I went to my dorm and was texting my girlfriend, she said she was alone and was at the cafeteria. So I asked if she wants company, she said yes. After a good time, we parted and we were just talking on the phone a while later. I've told her how my bestfriend couldn't meet me today. My girlfriend connected the wrong dots and said "" So you just used me as a substitute for your bestfriend's absence, all the while I was happy that you came, but you just were thinking about her, thanks for this treatment"" and stopped talking. She's not attending my calls and messages. 

I don't know what to do? Kindly help me out here guys.."
relationship_advice,Animals causing the end of a 2 year relationship..,"Me and my Gf have been dating for over 2 years now, we recently moved into an apartment. Her animals (1 dog, and 2 cats) have bad habits (peeing on anything left on the ground, peeing on carpet, peeing outside of litter box, throwing out litter, etc.) that is now turning Into an everyday thing.. I'm about to spend over $2,000 to get all the furniture we want but I don't want it to get ruined, and quite frankly I'm just tired of dealing with it in general. We have made major attempts and money to try and change the outcomes of the problems but the animals won't quit making messes. I warned my Gf this couldn't go on much longer or we would have to start trying to find a different home for them. I asked if that would be a problem for our relationship, to which she responded ""...idk."". Am I over reacting? She has had these animals for the last 9 years of her life, and I get the attachment, i love them too. But not so much to where they will destroy a whole apartment within a year that our lease is.. please any advice on the matter would be appreciated, and if you had the same issues how's you deal with them? Is there a way to get the animals to quit doing this that we just aren't trying? Thanks."
relationship_advice,My (26f) kids were born of incest/rape,"I’m uncomfortable with posting this on my actually account, so here I am on a throwaway. I am going to try and keep this as short as possible because it’s a trigger for me any day.
I was raped by my mother’s husband (NOT my birth father) from the time I was 8 or 9, up until I was 18 years old. For about 10 years I was physically, sexually, and mentally abused. When I was 17, my abuser got me pregnant and I was forced to blame it on my most recent ex, with no option of abortion. I gave birth to twin girls (now almost 9). Eventually the truth came out when my sister was mistaken for me in the middle of the night and the ball was finally dropped. He has fled as a wanted man and they can’t find him. For a while, I separated myself from my twins and the sight of them caused my stomach to turn. Despite this, I have done my best to be a mother to them because they are children and it’s not their fault. They already don’t have a father and I refuse to deprive them of a mother as well. So with a steady routine of medication and therapy I have grown into a passable (some times) mother. They started asking questions a few years ago about if they had a dad, and I have hidden behind answers like “you have a momma and a grandma! You don’t need a dad:)” and such but one day that’s not going to be enough and I know this. So I’m turning to Reddit to see if anyone has possibly been through this situation and how was it broken down for you? How can I tell them the truth (when they’re older yet) without burning them and ruining them for life?
TL;DR - kids were born of incest/rape and I don’t know how to tell them when they’re older."
relationship_advice,ThrowRA: I (20 yr old) female can’t connect emotionally with my (20yr old) boyfriend/ father of my child,"This is a throwaway account because my boyfriend follows my main. 

For a background my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now and our child was unplanned but we both made the decision to keep her. I’ve been living with him in preparing for the birth of the baby and am now 27 weeks. For the most part we get along fine and hardly argue, but that doesn’t mean we don’t fight. Which is where my problem is.
 
I am far more emotional than I normally am due to the pregnancy and will burst into tears about the smallest thing. That is a problem for him, because the more emotions spew out the less he wants to deal with them. We always fight about one thing, that being his response to my emotions. 

While I’m crying and pouring my heart out about something, he will be on his phone, or with his eyes closed. Often he will zone out and fall asleep. He gives very minimal responses and  acts otherwise disinterested. That makes me so mad and breaks my heart at the same time. I feel like he doesn’t want to talk to me/be around me sometimes. I suffer from very bad emotional lows and he doesn’t seem well equipped to deal with them. He will get mad or annoyed before he shows any other emotions first.

I love him very dearly and know he will make a great father because he is working hard to make a safe home for the baby. I know he cares about me enough because he is the kind of person who wouldn’t let me be around him if he didn’t want me to be. I guess I made this whole relationship sound toxic and I suppose in a small way it has its moments. 

I suppose my question is this, do I need to find another way to let out my emotions (i.g. a therapist or hobby) and stop trying to connect with my otherwise emotionally detached boyfriend?"
relationship_advice,Help lol,"I there, my name is Caleb. And I’m 15. Recently I went on a cruise and if you’ve been on a cruise you would know that they have these things called teen clubs. The teen clubs are basically a place or kids my age to hangout, do activities, stuff like that. I met a girl there. We really clicked and vibed together. We’d stay after the place technically closed and would lay next to each other and talk. And she’s is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen, I didn’t realize god made things as gorgeous as her. I don’t believe in love at first site but. Damn. I flirted with her, she flirted with me. But after the cruise it just kinda, stoped. When we text or ft she isn’t involved in the conversation. And she always gives one word answers like; ya, kk, same etc. I’m 99% sure she knows I’m into her. I don’t know why she would just stop being interested. Its not like we live far away from each other. It’s not like I stop being interested in her.  I feel like if she wasn’t into me then just tell me you’re not into me, don’t lead me on. I I guess my question is why she would do this and what do I do. Sorry if this was long. Thanks fir reading this far. Have a good day"
relationship_advice,Keep having sex with my ex of a few months. Do I need to stop?,"I am a 22 year old woman and my ex is a 23 year old man. We were dating for about 8 months when we split up 3 months ago. It wasn't a very acrimonious breakup. We both realized that we weren't really investing into the relationship, that we had no interest in moving in together, that we cared each other but in a ""Hey you're fun to hang out with"" kind of way not a ""Let me build my life around you"" kind of way. I'm focused on finishing my degree and trying to maintain non-romantic relationships, he's focused on dealing with some of his mental health issues, and neither of us felt up to the effort of a grown-up relationship. 

We agreed to stay friends, and within like two weeks of the breakup we'd gotten tipsy and hooked up again. We were like ""Oops, probably shouldn't have done that"", but then a few days later he booty-called me and well... anyway, we've been fucking almost as much since we broke up as we did before. 

My friends keep telling me that it's a terrible idea to fuck your ex. But I honestly don't see a good reason to stop. The sex has always been mindblowing (most of the reason we lasted as long as we did tbh) and honestly it's been nice to hang out with him without the pressure of trying to be People Who Are Dating. I feel like we're getting to be better friends than we were when we were a couple. Plus he's into some of the same kinks as I am, and I really don't want to give that up.

Am I missing something? My friends aren't really giving me concrete *reasons* why I shouldn't, they're saying it's something that you just don't do."
relationship_advice,My ex bf is giving me mixed feelings.,"my ex bf of 4 yrs have been separated for 3-6 months...  to say the least, we were basically like a married couple and i know he cared about me a lot.    we stopped talking and i thought we both moved on.  i dont think he seriously dated anyone but i was dating.  well i was kinda sad that he didnt greet me happy birthday or for the holidays.  

i had moved out of state. 

long story short, my best friend sent him a photo of us without my knowledge and a few days later when i found out, i texted him.  he called me and said he was having lunch alone.   we planned to go out for drinks that night. 

when i initially saw him again, we gave each other a long hug and a kiss on the cheek.  during the date, all the good feelings had surfaced and we had a great time.  he even offered to drop me off at my gf's house even though it was out of the way and he unexpectedly gifted me $$$ for chinese new years.  its just something he usually does out of kindness but this time, it was 10x the amount.  

i'm so confused as to why he did this?  he didnt even expect anything in return.  i had been texting him but our convos are kept very short.."
relationship_advice,"My(F21) husband (m26) I think got me pregnant on purpose,and I didn’t want kids yet.","My husband and I been married little over and year and he has been pressuring me about having a kids and told him no that I wanted to wait till I’m done with college and that would be when I’m 23 that’s a good age for me..I thought we both agreed, I did stop taking my pills because my body wasn’t liking it and making me gain weight and told him this because I wanted him to wear condoms and he agreed then couple of the last times we stopped using condoms because he begged and begged so I let him and he swore he would pull out... so I believed him and I told him to tell me right away if he did came a bit inside so I could get the Plan B.

relationship_advice,I [21M] may have a crush on my best friend's younger sister [17F] and am uncomfortable about the age gap.,"Had to make a throw away as my friend knows my username.

So I have had the same best friend for over a decade, we go to the same college and are roommates to this day. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years and before we broke up I started to notice some feelings that were part of the reason I reconsidered my relationship.

I am a 21 year old male and have always dated girls my own age, but I recently started to have this idea/feelings of attraction for my best friend's younger sister who is only 17. I have known her and their whole family forever and they treat me as their son and I have always looked at this girl like my little sister and treated her as such. There is a familial bond between all of us. I am not sexually attracted to her, it isn't a lustful feeling or anything like that. I just have this feeling of comfort when I think about one day when she is a little older, having an intimate relationship with her. I know her family values and I can tell she is going to grow up into a beautiful woman (she is very pretty right now but in the sense of a girl her age) with strong moral character as I have seen how she was raised.

Right now this age gap is wrong and inapproproate and it feels as such, I do not want to come off as a predator and as I said before, don't see her in any serious romantic light currently. **I guess I am just curious if it is crazy to wait until she is older and maybe start to introduce the idea of her not seeing me as her older brother because in a couple years, a 4 year age gap is nothing.** It is just the fact that right now with us being at different points in our lives that it is inappropriate, I mean high school vs college is insane. I would never even consider this possibility if I was not already so close to her and her family, I am sure that is what is making me feel this way.

 I have never experienced anything like this before and have only told 2 people (one of them being her mom) and just need some general guidance.

TL;DR: I think I have a crush on my best friend's little sister who is significantly younger than me, curious if I am crazy to wait for her."
relationship_advice,Feeling stuck,"Do you ever feel like you’re stuck in a relationship because your lives are so engrossed in each other’s? 
I love my boyfriend but lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m hanging on due to the family and friends I would lose otherwise."
relationship_advice,I’ve had a crush on a friend since middle school and I’ve tried so hard to stop crushing on him but my feelings won’t go away...,I am a 20 year old female who’s had a crush on a friend for the past 5 years. I’ve know him for 9 years and for the first 4 years I had seen him as just a friend. I don’t know what happened along those 4 years but I started to like him. I don’t think he know I like him but I’m also not 100% sure if he has feelings for me. I don’t want to ruin our friendship so I never said anything. He’s been in multiple relationships while I’ve never been in one because I keep comparing other guys to him. I’ve tried dating but nothing ever goes far enough for me to say I had a boyfriend. I’ve been single my entire life; not saying that’s a bad thing. I just want to know if I should go for it and tell him I like him. Sorry this is super out of order. I’m scared of rejection and I don’t have a lot of friends. I’m not what you call a social butterfly so I’m scared of losing a childhood friend. Should I look for signs that he likes me in a romantic way or should I straight up ask him if he has feelings for me? If anyone can give me any advice please tell me. I wanna see a different perspective of the predicament I am in. Should I lose a friend for telling them my feelings or should I push a side my feelings but keep a good friendship?
relationship_advice,Signs shes losing interest in you,"A lot of this will sound like common sense but when you have relationship goggles on it's hard to accept and really believe these things. Heres a list of things I've noticed in my failed long term relationship before she dumped me. The following most likely means shes losing interest or fell out of love with you:

Isnt happy to see you most of the time

Will cancel plans with you to see friends

Will lie to you

Will dress up very nice to go out but dress like a homeless person everytime they see you. (Not always a bad thing. That could mean they're just really comfortable around you. But if its literally every time she sees you she most likely doesn't care about impressing you anymore.)

Lack of sex or any intimacy (VERY big red flag. She will always try to make excuses to spare your feelings like ""I'm bloated"" or ""I'm just stressed"" because she doesnt have the balls to just say she isnt attracted to you anymore.)

Is always in a bad mood or mean to you for no reason.(shes most likely getting sick of you but doesn't want to dump you yet so shes frustrated and takes it out on you.)

Lack of interest in what you have to say or doesnt seem ""with it"" when you guys are together.

So what can you do when she starts losing interest? 90% of the time, nothing. By then she has already made up in her mind that shes done with you. People change and sometimes she just wants something new. A lot of the time it's not your fault. That also means theres nothing you can do to change her mind. A small percentage of the time you can try talking it through so that's worth a shot.

Still getting over my ex when shes completely moved on and not looking back. So I wanted to wake some of you guys up so to speak and end things when they turn sour instead of being in a relationship where your partner doesnt love you anymore. I was fighting a losing battle for a couple years and regret not ending it myself sooner."
relationship_advice,Am I being too sensitive,"My boyfriend is a ladies man, always has been. I'm not insecure about him cheating on me necessarily, but I do get insecure about whether he finds me attractive.

Now, he always makes offhanded remarks about other women he finds attractive, in real life and in media. He'll casually mention ""her tits were out, they caught my eye"" or ""she's got a really nice ass"" or stuff like that about other women, but he rarely compliments me because ""you should already know I find you attractive if I'm dating you.""

While I see his logic, it still kinda feels shitty that he's willing to compliment every other woman except me. And sometimes when I'm really insecure and need reassurance, he just gets really mad that I feel that way and still refuses to compliment me.

I know it isn't his responsibility to make me not insecure, but I feel like he could have a little sympathy for the fact that I'm human and I get insecure and I just want to feel wanted. And if he can compliment any other random girls ass, it wouldn't kill him to compliment mine from time to time.

Is he right that he shouldn't have to compliment me because dating me should be compliment enough?"
relationship_advice,Does he get a second chance as a sex offender?,"This guy I’ve been dating for the past week let me know that 5 years ago, he was 26 and went to an adult chat room after a falling out with his then girlfriend. He met a girl on there and she told him she was 18. They decided to meet in person and he found out she was actually 14. He made the decision to have sex with her anyway. He was put in jail and is a felon on the sex offender registry for about 8 years (he has 3 years left). 

He says he deeply regrets it. He was caught in a bad moment in his life and would never do it again. He is a very sweet guy and my gut feeling is he has changed. 

What are your thoughts and what would you do in my situation?"
relationship_advice,Attached but want vengeance,"I (27f) love my significant other but lately this man has been nothing but disrespectful, I’m talking blocking me, ignoring, and mind you we see each other everyday. I cannot help but be paranoid about him being unfaithful..He’s broken up with me before but he always comes back, but I want to seriously just make this man suffer..I want him to feel just the same shit I feel. Today I took a stand and yelled “FU” and it hurt but felt so great. I cannot picture my life without him...but I wish he would change, or work on certain things I don’t feel like I’m asking for much...just the basic respect..y’all I’m torn I’m crying and wanting to punch this mans lights out...wtf do I do.. in the end I feel I won’t take vengeance because I would feel like shit..and then I realize he wins he always wins because he gets what he wants...me being heartbroken and him knowing he can say sorry and be back with me..thanks for reading my rant/venting"
relationship_advice,My (19f) boyfriend (20m) is manipulative and hiding things from me.,"I’m on mobile, so apologies for my format in advance. Anyways. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost a year now. Things were great from the start and then slowly went downhill. To make things shorter, I’ll just summarize the bad things that are part of why I feel the way I do. 

To start off, my ex boyfriend had my passwords to everything on my phone, social media’s, email, everything. And I had the same with him. There was never a double standard. With my current boyfriend, however, there is.

Over the course of our relationship he’s lied to me. Like, a lot. About even small things. Ranging from when him and his ex broke up to hanging out with her, and I recently found out that within the first week of our relationship he fucked her. He acknowledges what he did, and we have since made amends but I understand that’s no way to start a relationship. But I didn’t know until almost 10 months later. 

Now here’s my problem. As you can tell, I’ve never done a single thing to break his trust. But he has lied to me several times and is rather manipulative. For example, he has gone through my phone 3-4 times during our relationship all during an argument. Without my permission. I was yelling and demanding he give back my phone, but he didn’t. I also made the mistake of using the same password for my phone, as I do with a couple of my social media’s. I’ve never given him my phone password but he’s always found them out by looking over my shoulder. I have a fingerprint lock but sometimes use my actual password, and he watches me secretly. He found out my password and logged into two of my instagrams behind my back for months without my knowledge. Prying, going through things. It was horrible. I felt so violated after finding out. I was about to breakup with him, but he apologized and recognized he shouldn’t have done it but he has “trust issues because of his ex (not recent but basically his first girlfriend) who smoked pot and cheated on him in high school”. I felt like that was a bit of a reach but I understood and let it slide. But made him log out of everything and I changed my passwords. 

I’ve went through his phone once. One time. During our whole relationship. And I had to do it behind his back while he was sleeping. He made the mistake of sending me the pin to his phone. But his phone is also unlocked by Face ID, so it’s I can’t get into it now that he’s changed his pin. But I took his phone while he was sleeping and went through it. I found a lot of stuff. He wasn’t talking to any girls, but he was talking shit on me to his best friend. That I annoyed him sometimes, and stuff like that. I obviously was hurt and offended. But the cherry on top of the cake, is that he had a fake Instagram account of a girl he was using to talk to one of my best guy friends. He was using this fake account to talk to him and try to figure out if I was secretly dating him. I was so mad. That’s a pretty far out thing to do. 

It’s been months since that’s happened and he brings it up on occasion that it was fucked up for me to do. But I don’t care because he’s gotten to go through my phone so many times. He always says he “feels like something is going on behind his back” so he gets to at least look to calm his feelings down. Never with me allowing him to, but he just takes matters into his own hands on looking through my phone. But not just that. I always let him hold my phone with it on, watch videos, watch me when I’m on my phone. None of which he lets me do. But he claims I’m so much worse about my phone. 

This is why I’m so upset. He just confessed to sleeping with his ex the first week we were together. He claims I’m his first love and he’s so stupid and doesn’t deserve me. He’s right but 🤷‍♀️. I feel he’s hiding more stuff from me and the only way to know would be to look through his phone. But I don’t know his pin and he doesn’t have my face in his phone. I don’t know what to do and I’m at a loss. He gets to look through mine whenever. But I don’t want to ask to look through his outright because I know he will throw a fit and cause an argument and then run to the bathroom and delete whatever is on it. I need to catch him outright. Any advice? 

Also, please don’t call this immature or tell me to breakup with him. I know what I need to do, I just want to be petty and catch him first lol. I think there’s fun and consolation in that. Thanks in advance."
relationship_advice,How do I move on from an ancient breakup,"I (26M) was in a year long LDR that I (regrettably) ended about two years ago since I felt I wasn't ready, and a few weeks later she ended the friendship and we haven't spoken since. I never expected her to cut me out completely but I guess I made her uncomfortable towards the end and she wanted to move on. What's embarrassing is that I haven't stopped thinking about her almost everyday for the past 2 years, and feel a bit sad knowing that something that could've been real and beautiful was wasted. I keep checking in on her social media and rereading old chat logs (convincing myself that its not unhealthy), wondering if she still has feelings for me. Even when I'm at work or go on a vacation her name constantly echos in my mind. I really just want to move on as I'm realizing this could potentially go on longer more than I anticipate."
relationship_advice,"Long relationship and extended period of no contact, what to do?","Im coming into a situation where I've already been unable to talk to my partner of 12 years for 3 months currently due to legal issues, there is a chance that this could extend for another 9 months or more while waiting for the trial to start and finish. Im unsure if my partner would wait the extra 9 months to stay with me or if she would leave. What would you do in this situation wait the time, stand by your partner and hope it goes well or just give up and exit the relationship?"
relationship_advice,What do I do? I can’t believe this,"3 years and the entire time I’ve dated this bitch and gave her my heart money and time she’s all she every did is walk all over me and I don’t know what I should do rn about this Her family thinks we are dating but she’s fucking different people and and absolutely not one of her friends think I’m anything but a weird crazy prick cause I get mad when I find out she be flirting and I Find our cause she gave me her passwords, she’s so fake and it’s fucking nuts she’s telling her friends that she’s “scared” of me and all kinds of shit but around me all she does is use me for sex and money what the fuck do I do And the parts of her family that did believe her when she told them hate her and haven’t talked to her for a long ass time cause they met me and saw I’m a great guy, they all told me including her own grandmother said I deserve better and I’ve always known it because I’ve caught her flirting and other shit but couldn’t dump her cause I love her which I thought she loved me and now she’s telling people that if she changes that passwords and shit or sum she thinks I’d hurt her or her family like bro that hurts the most and tbh I just wanna fucking cry like a pussy. So basically I found out 10 min ago that she’s been pretending like I’m a nobody for the last 3 years and and is telling people that she thinks I’d hit her or hurt her family (which hurts the most) I’m sorry for the length but I’m just straight bawling knowing she never cared"
relationship_advice,She says causal but acts differently,"So a bit ago I bought flowers for a girl who i recently started ""courting"". She said she doesn't know if she seriously wants to date just yet because she just getting back into the swing of things after coming back from a couple of months abroad. We also have a professional relationship that she doesn't want to sour. So instead we agreed on just going with the flow of things and going out on dates. We agreed we were going on dates to see if we were compatible for a relationship eventually and thus agreed that we were ""courting"". Though again that it was to remain casual. But that's so vague I have no idea what it means to be casual especially because her comments at times betray her ""casual attitude"".

For instance. She says she likes to keep the flowers in her bedroom because she likes to wake up to them in the morning. In my mind she is telling me she starts off everyday with her first thought being of me. That doesn't seem casual. 

She drops hints that she talks to her friends about me.

She mentions how picky she is in choosing people to see. 

She is often the one to reach out.

On days we meet professional she expresses her excitement in seeing me. She tells me things like ""you have to know you are one of a kind right? Like in a good way I mean."" When I called her out for a cheesy comment she says ""I figure I dont have to hold back with you"".

She likes to tease me about being old fashioned and will often call me ""old man"" with cute emojis. 

Is it just me or does it seem shes interested in something more than just casual. It seems to me she is much more along in her feelings than she lets on."
relationship_advice,So...what do I do now?,"So this happened a couple of days ago, but I'm still thinking about it. I'm at a west coast college, and I'm doing pretty well in my classes. One of my classes, microeconomics, is pretty hard, and a lot of people are having trouble as we approach the final in a few weeks. 

This one girl, who I've barely spoken to, approaches me out of the blue, and asks for my help studying. I say sure, and over the next few days, she keeps randomly complimenting me when I see her - like, ""Oh you're so smart, etc."" I'm not an idiot, and I recognize the subtle manipulation attractive girls can use to get guys to do what they want, so I don't really assign any significance to any of it. 

When we finally get to studying, we spend a few hours, most of which is just talking and joking around. We studied, sure, but a lot of it was getting to know each other, and discussing life. She definitely touched my arm enough times that I noticed, and she acted embarrassed a lot, despite that not really being her style. 

Overall, I started questioning whether or not anything was going on. 

After the study session, she called for a bit, and we continued discussing some of the topics we were speaking about. 

Here's the thing. I want to ensure I'm not blinded by early 20s guy hormones. Do y'all think there's a chance here, despite this all beginning over finals? Should I wait to see any further interaction. I'm not sure what to do.

Thanks!"
relationship_advice,I’m lonely as f*** and don’t know how much more I can take of it,I feel like I’m the loneliest person in this city and I’ll never find love. I’ve been looking at the traffic from my condo for the past 2 hours wondering how the hell im so lonely when I live around so many people and drinking wine. I just want to enjoy someone’s presence.
relationship_advice,I (20f) almost got into an argument with my (19m) boyfriend about housework,"So my SO and I live together. We both go to schools in the same area, so we have an apartment between the two.  

He is amazing, and he does a lot for me. Of the two of us, he is definitely more organized and clean. I am very ditzy and forgetful, and sometimes I have him run stuff up to me/Vice versa (although he isn’t has forgetful as I am, so he is definitely running up to my school to get me things more than I am his.) 

Our schedules, however, are drastically different. I go to an intensive academy, where my school days are very long (9am-7pm most days). I also work on top of that, so some days I won’t be at the apartment at all until 10pm. It’s a performance school, so a lot of the stuff we do is also very physically demanding. His schedule is a lot more laid back, and most days he only has 1-2 hour long classes. There is one day a week where his schedule is even close to as busy as mine. 

Because of this, he does do a lot of the upkeep at the apartment. We both cook, but he does dishes and cleans up the kitchen most nights. There have been times (I get an hour break to come home and have lunch every day) where I will also ask him to help me with certain homework things/run errands for me while I’m at school. (Sometimes I give him my card so he can pick up my half of the groceries, etc.) other than dishes and errands, we pretty much split our general upkeep. (We both do our own laundry, we both maintain our own work stations, we both keep the bathroom tidy, etc.) 

The other day, however. He approached me and asked me to do the dishes at about 11pm. I said that I was really tired from school/work, but I could do them the next day. He kinda blew up at me a little bit. He started saying how he is always cleaning and running errands for me and was very frustrated that I couldn’t do this one thing for him. I responded that I have a much busier schedule, and that he has a lot of free time during the day that I just don’t have to do these things. He responded that while he may not have a schedule as tight as mine, that he works just as hard as I do. I did kind of get upset at this, because while yes, he does do a LOT for me and he also has his own school work to account for: he doesn’t have a job, and most days he is home before 12pm. When I come home, he is usually playing video games. I feel like if you aren’t at school full time/working, then it’s only fair to pick up more of the household duties? I haven’t exactly expressed this to him. And I understand he is frustrated because I could be helping out more on the weekends/when I’m not working. But I also just feel a slight bit of resentment because I WISH I had as much free time as he did, and I get frustrated when I do rely on him to help me out sometimes and he acts like I’m asking him to do some insanely difficult task. I feel bad that he feels this way, but part of me is also a little upset about it. Maybe I’m being a major asshole, idk. But I also don’t feel like I should have to be in school full time, and work, and do the house work.  Is there anyone who maybe has more experience living with a SO who has had similar issues pop up? This is our first major relationship (of 3 years) and we both are still figuring out what home is for us. Any advice would be appreciated."

relationship_advice,My ex [26F] broke up with me [26M] because our relationship was too toxic,"It’s already been one week after our breakup. Sorry if I’m going to sound desperate throughout the post.

So for some backstory, my ex and I have been in a relationship for close to 11 months now. I had a 5 year relationship before her, and she had a 11 month relationship before me (the guy cheated!). We were working under the same company.

We started out pretty strong where we always talked about problems and was always calm on reaching a compromise. We did have a lot of fights but most of them were due to small and petty things like not giving updates or forgetting to reply “I love you”. 

But eventually when I left to work for another company, which was still close-by to hers and we still would see each other everyday, we started to have longer fights with the same petty reasons. It was more of a she would get angry all of a sudden then that would provoke me sort of thing. I am sort of a fighter with arguments and always want to point out if someone was wrong (I know I’m too much!)

So we had a fight last week where she decides that she was emotionally-drained and wanted time to heal. She said that she was afraid that with our current situation, our relationship would fall apart in the future. I initially tried to respect her decision, but when it sank it I literally begged her to give me a final chance. Now we’re not speaking to each other with her last message saying that she still loves me.

She means the world to me and I would cross the seven-seas for her, but I am trying to give her the space and time that she needs. I both think we have our faults, but I still want to give it a chance if she’s willing.

She’s agreed to talk about our relationship again after she’s healed, so what I want to ask is that should I leave her completely alone? Or should I show her that I’m still here but give her the breathing space she needs?

Btw, she has very low self-esteem and I am quite sure no 3rd party is involved.

TL;DR: GF broke up with me because she was afraid the relationship would fall apart in the future. I still want to improve myself and give it another go, what should I do?"
relationship_advice,Love Charms are real. Believe it or not!,I am not here to waste your time. People are impatient. Even the ones you love don't take the time to get to know the real you. SO they never give you a chance. What I offer you is the opportunity to make them slow down and bond with you. So that the seed of love is planted.  if you would love to know more...
relationship_advice,Update: my (32m) gf (25f) finally opened up and told me that she is falling for another man,"This is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ew5ed6/should_we_32m_25f_break_up_because_she_is_not/

She finally gave me clarity on things and said that she has 'tension' and feels chemistry with someone else at her work.

This is a bullet to my heart. I never saw anyone else but her. I was so loyal to her and the love between us. We had rough patches but I never thought it will reach to the point of breaking up for good after 6 years relationship. 

I guess my problem is that I cannot even process this. I did not cry or greif like I was expecting i will. It just hurts endlessly to be fooled like this by someone who was talking marriage to you few days ago.

I did everything for this girl she is my soul and mu heart and she is taking that away from me. I dont wish her any harm though. I just want to be fine and get over this as soon as possible.

I guess i don't need any advice i just need emotional support and to be told you are not alone. I am so scared i will be depressed again. It took me years to get over another ex relationship and don't want to go through that again. It was so damaging. 

I am a very emotional intense person and i am not greifing i just feel anger. A lot of anger but i want to let everything go including her. Maybe she is right at the end maybe i don't deserve this rollercoaster relationship i deserve a hatmonic one where i home and safe. And giving and receiving relationship. 

I would appreciate any thoughts/advice from people who went through the experience of their SO dropping out after +5 years. Tell me what happened and what happens next.

As for her. Life will be a great teacher. As it always is 🙏🏼"
relationship_advice,I [24M] think my best friend [25M] is an alcoholic and don't know if I should help him or distance myself from him to save myself.,"So I have been thinking about this situation for the last week or two now and I need some different perspectives because I'm honestly at a loss for what to do.

Background:

So I met my best friend (C) when I was 20 years old in April 2016, shortly after I moved out on my own and was still getting over a bad break up. He really helped me by just being there, listening to me and letting me vent, as well as just getting me out of the house in general. Normally I'm an introvert and am content with spending my time at work or alone in my apartment, but he really tried to get me out of my shell. 

Come November I met my soon-to-be second girlfriend and things were great for the most point. The only points of contention was that he didn't agree with her political views, but who cares, wasn't a super huge deal to me and id be the one sleeping next to her at the end of the day so what did it matter? After dating for about 6 months we ended up moving in together in a big city about 3 hours away from C. Anyway, fast forward to September of 2017  and her and I broke up and I moved back to the same city C and I had met in. During this time he also broke up with his fiance of 5 years who he had been cheating on and she had been cheating on for revenge, many many times. One night he texts me and asks me go to the liquor store and buy him beer cause he ""Wanted to drink his ex away"". Since I had moved back he hadn't made an attempt to hang out with me otherwise and only texted me when he needed something from me. Then the following exchange occurred (paraphrasing a bit since its been a few years:

Me: ""Why is it that I'm going through a break up as well but yet the only time you ever hit me up is when you need a ride somewhere or for me to be your personal delivery service?""

C: ""First of all, you're not going through a real break up, you were only with her for a year and all she was was an ""extended hookup"", I'm actually going through a break up and I figured you'd at least step up and try and help me, but since you cant do that, then fuck you.""

After that we didn't speak for the next 9 months or so, but finally reconciled at the request of one of our mutual friends. 

The past 6 months and situation:

So in the past 6 months C has been going through another breakup with a girl he'd been dating for about 8 months. During this time he has HEAVILY turned to alcohol to cope. Like to the extent that he was drinking every day until he got a DUI while riding his motorcycle. After that he slowed down for a few months (and by slow down I mean he only drank at home and maybe 5 days out of the week instead of 7). As soon as he was off probation though he was right back at it. I enjoy having a few drinks every now and then to have fun and unwind but I'm talking maybe once or twice a month. Hes drinking to the point of passing out nightly.

It got better in November when he met his current girlfriend (a mutual coworker of ours) but after a month hes pretty much right back where he was. What spurred this post is the fact that he left work early, went home and drank all day to the point he had to take the next day off because he was so hung over (This isn't the first time either). Second, he is CONSTANTLY making passive aggressive, rude comments to his girlfriend, and even when she tells him to stop he will keep pressing until she either storms away or argues back. And after only 3 months of dating shes already wanting out. It makes me uncomfortable when I'm around and I feel bad for how upset she is coming in to work after they've had a fight the night before (which is almost daily).

So my question to reddit is what should I do? I want to help him but I'm afraid even if I try to intervene he will just say ""its not that bad"", ""I don't need help"" etc etc. In addition to that I can already tell hes pulling me in a bad direction of wanting to drink all the time. So should I try and distance myself from him as best I can until I cut contact completely? That is not a road I want to go down as I have seen more than 1 family member destroy their life with booze.

If anyone has questions please feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can, I know there is a lot to digest in here.

TL:DR; Best Friend has a drinking problem causing him to miss work and treat the people around him like shit. Should I intervene and get him help or distance myself from him before he drags me down as well?"
relationship_advice,Wife wants a divorce but I don’t as I still love her and want to make it work.,"I (25M) and my wife (23F) have been together for 8 years, 2 of those married; we live in the Deep South (TX). She just told me two weeks ago that she wants a divorce, she was not happy with me anymore, and wasn’t in love or attracted to me. She loved me more like a friend then a sexual partner. She thinks she got married too young and didn’t get to have fun, like her sister and her friends. She didn’t get to make the mistakes that everyone makes. (Ex: her mom left her first husband, but is now happily married with her third husband) She says that she would probably regret the divorce but not until later. I know I probably missed all sorts of signs and am more than willing to take my blame for the lack of awareness I had. I didn’t know what to do, I ended up taking the air mattress upstairs and the bathroom upstairs as well to help provide the space/room she is wanting. She isn’t cheating on me as of right now, but has voiced her fantasies of other men. (I have also glance over her phone) I’ve tried to do things that I failed to do during the last two years such as light candles and run a nice bubble bath for when she gets home, and cook dinner while she is in it. Also buy her favorite chocolates and write short notes to her in the morning for when she wakes up. She appreciates the effort i am putting forth, and recognizes it but says she just doesn’t have anything to give.. We are starting counseling this Tuesday, I do not know what it will help as she is very adamant that this divorce will solve her problems of unhappiness in the marriage. In regards to the sex, we were having it very often before marriage it took a slight decline when we got married then 6 months in she stopped wanting to cuddle, be touched or even kiss. For the last year and a half we have sex maybe once a month, but i could tell she wasn’t into it. I tried to bring up the fact that if something was wrong i would like to talk about it to see if i can improve or help her relax. She would only have sex with me after she drank some wine, which was usually 4+ glasses.. I’m hoping the therapy will give me some way to figure out what she is needing from me in our relationship, I’m lost and hurt that she never felt like she was able to talk to me about problems. I probably did something to hurt her but I don’t know what, and she won’t talk to me. She doesn’t think the counseling will help, but I don’t want to give up on her, I still love her. She told me yesterday that i need to stop with all of the notes, and chocolates and dates. She wants to be left alone, i suggested that she takes a trip somewhere by herself if she is needing silence and isolation from everyone. So all of this long old message to ask if there are any people out there who would be able to advise me if I’m doing the right thing for someone who wants to be left alone."
relationship_advice,What steps should I take to move on from my Ex? Need advice cause this really hurts(and I deserve it),"Hello all? So to make a long story short, I had a bad breakup with my ex. I broke up with her due to my own insecurities and trust issues. We made a agreement to be friends in the future but honestly I’m not sure about that. I’m currently going to therapy to work on my issues but honestly, the pain of the breakup hurts so much and the regret is even worse. I guess it’s deserved, but in order to move on what steps should I take? Honestly If I could do it all over again I would of never broke up with her. Every time I think about her I keep a sad and depressed feeling. All the memories, just the thought of her or things related to her. I deleted all of our photos, videos, and try to stay away from songs that would get me in my feelings but nothing seems to help. I guess I got to ride this one out. I can’t go to sleep, even thinking about other women and sex makes me depressed. I just hurt so bad right now. What advice would you give me?? I have 2 job interviews later, hopefully that get my mind off things, but being it’s the weekend, the thought of her going out with her other men makes me sad. Again I guess this is karma and I’ll take that I deserve it, but man this is painful."
relationship_advice,I need advice on how to cut off my crush and best friend,"Honestly I don’t think I can deal with it anymore they hang out with my main group as well and it sucks. When I see them together I feel that pain you get in your chest when your heartbroken. And I can’t deal with it anymore rejection already stings but her choosing someone else makes me feel worse. 

Honestly I feel like my friend is holding me back the girls always pay attention to him. And I feel bad every time we go out and I’m not ugly, he’s just really good looking in comparison. But I feel it’s wrong to go with no explanation what should I do?"
relationship_advice,I’m [M18] not sure when or if I should breakup with my girlfriend [F18],"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now and for the most part it’s been great. A few missteps of course but overall a strong relationship. For a bit of background, before we began dating she had been in a depressive and occasionally self harming for years, with only a few friends who were doing nothing to help. I would consider this girl one of my closest friends. We have lots in common, including in the bedroom, so that’s clearly not an issue. And yet for the past month I’ve felt that I’m falling out of love with her. The only thing I can think of is her habit of occasionally acting very cold or angry towards me over little things, but it usually blows over fairly quickly. She will sometimes do attention grabby stuff like pouting until I acknowledge it but nothing much else. Over the past while I’ve felt less interested in our conversations, spending time, or planning long term whatsoever, and have been considering splitting up. I know that if I break up she won’t have much of a support circle to go to and that’s what scares me. I’m afraid she’ll go back into the isolation and possible self harm from the past. I’d like to be there for her as a friend but not necessarily in a relationship anymore, but what if she pushes me away completely? She says I’m the only thing pushing her to continue working hard in school or get up in the morning. She’s still deeply in love with me, always talking about our future and living together and while I do love her, I’m not sure I want to be in this relationship anymore. I’m lost in this situation since I care so deeply for this girl, and don’t want to ruin her life."
relationship_advice,"Should I (22F) lie to this guy (29M) and say I have a boyfriend now, or should I wait until he asks me out?","I started a new waitressing job a couple weeks ago, and there's this slightly older waiter who clearly likes me a lot. There's no doubt about it. He hasn't explicitly told me, but it's extremely obvious. Just trust me. 

He's not creepy or anything. He's very sweet and respectful, and he's even fairly attractive. I wouldn't say he's *cute* but I also wouldn't say he's ugly. I wouldn't mind being his platonic friend at all - I actually kind of enjoy his company at work - but I don't want to date him. It's not one of those ""you never know who you'll fall for"" or ""maybe he'll grow on you"" situations. I know for a fact that I'll never develop romantic feelings for him.

Since I can tell that he likes me, I wouldn't be at all surprised if he asked me out sometime in the near future. In fact, I can kind of sense it coming. So, I'm going to lie and say I have a boyfriend. I know that lying isn't good, but I feel like it's the best way to turn someone down without hurting their feelings. Telling someone directly that you ""don't like them that way"" leads to embarrassment and insecurity. I can't tell him that I ""don't date co-workers"" because this is just a stupid temporary job and we both know that rule doesn't apply to jobs like these. 

So. my question is this: should I find a way to subtly mention ""my boyfriend"" next time I talk to him so he doesn't ask me out at all? That way I won't unintentionally lead him on. Or should I wait until he asks me out and *then* tell him I ""have a boyfriend""?"
relationship_advice,Sexual assault victim in a dying relationship,"My boyfriend (21m) and I (21f) have been dating for about 16 months. Our relationship is dying, I’m working on improving myself by going to therapy once/twice a week (i’m a sexual assault victim). Friends have tried to force themselves onto me in the past. This is why I get v uncomfortable and lash out at my boyfriend when he hangs out with girls alone. Yes I’m aware of how messed up that is and I’ve been working on that...

He doesn’t attempt to reassure me and now does not tell me when he hangs out with women (because he’s scared). I feel horrible about how I’ve reacted, and now he hangs out with his female friends in secret...

However, not to excuse my actions. He has gone out with friends when we are together and not thought to invite me at all. Telling me I can go home or wait in his room (we don’t live together). This has hurt me and makes me feel like I’m not respected in the relationship. 

He called me a gremlin last week thinking it was cute..but I was hurt by this because I have been bullied because of my height (5’4”). He was leaving to Tahoe that weekend, and he suddenly started to feel v insecure. I reassured him and asked for him to send me a picture of him in Tahoe. He left to Tahoe with his club and did not send me a picture or anything and I lashed out after I had an anxiety attack...I just thought wow he can’t bother to send me a picture after I reassured him, right after he called me a gremlin and I told him it hurt my feelings :( 

I’ve never loved anyone like this before, after I was assaulted I told myself I wasn’t going to get in a relationship (before I met him)...because I felt so broken. I tried to break up with him awhile ago and he threw a tantrum ripping a bag out of my hands and throwing my clothes around the room.. I was scared...but I care about him...

We’re giving each other space right now...but I explained to him earlier one of his friends told me relationships are bs awhile back...He was mean to my boyfriend for awhile and he was a wreck...Now they’re friends again and I’m sure he’s suggesting we break up...

At this point I’m just going to work on dealing with my trauma and whatever happens...happens...

If you’ve been sexually assaulted and suddenly end up in a relationship...dont bother...you just end up hurting them and yourself... :("
relationship_advice,I've been lukewarm with some friends and I [15m] dunno how to draw the line,"
I have no good reason to stop talking to them since we don't have big conversations anyways, but I've been trying to take care of my depression and brain fog issues before I try talking to people (I have no actual friends) since my brain fogs up and I say weird stuff. I don't know how to say I need space without coming across as an asshole or psycho since we barely talk in the first place, but it's really taxing keeping it up. The people are;


- popular girl, who I barely know at all but used to sit near me in class. I don't want to fuck this one up since above all I'd feel bad about it; I get the sense that she's not a total bitch.


- popularish girl who probably thinks I'm a psycho, because I emotionally opened up over text (and... She didn't even respond. Are you fucking kidding me lmao) and we haven't talked in like a month - what with winter break and all that. I have no idea where to start on this. When we were texting she didn't seem to take any interest in what I had to say and it was really just me trying way too hard to make her laugh (something I learned to calm down on, especially when your brain is broken), and I happened to be feeling like shit so I vented. I wasn't rude but I made it absolutely clear I knew she didn't want to talk, and told her it'd be better if she blocked me. Problem is we still go to the same school -_- genius plan except for that part


- meme dealer guy, who I feel really awkward around since it's hard to pin down the kind of shit he wants to talk about. This is one I feel like I need to back off on because of my own problems.


- douchebag popular guy who says hi in the halls sometimes, basically the short king of the school. I get the sense that he's being passive aggressive. I'm sure he's not actually a douche, but I have my reasons to be irked.



So obviously there's kind of a few people who I'm trying to avoid. I'm just at a loss for what to do so I'm turning to reddit for advice. Thanks in advance"
relationship_advice,I am (31f) crushing on my roommate (38m).,"We are very playful  with each other, tickling each other while watching TV, mostly him tickling me, he isn't very ticklish. Some how I ended up laying on my side pretty much on top of him. He  pspanked my bottom a few times. (It was torture because it is a big turn on for me). After awhile he ended up kinda playing with with my hair and kinda pulling it a little. I wanted to drag him to bed. But I was unsure if he was being playful or trying to be be flirty. I am scared to make a move because he is also my best friend."
relationship_advice,Came across ex on tinder and feeling tempted to text,"So basically she broke up with me 3 weeks ago and i was going to break up with her because I could tell she wasn’t putting in the same effort like she used to. She said she lost her feelings for me and she wanted to focus on herself so we ended it. I’ve been on tinder (23m) and just messing around and I recently came across her today. Now I’m really tempted to just text her tomorrow and say what’s up or call her. But everyone I know says don’t call her. I really don’t want to let her move on to someone else without another shot of trying to get her back but at the same time I don’t want her back and want to find better but I’m not over her, idk. It just hurts seeing that she’s talking to other guys."
relationship_advice,"Am I being unreasonable, expecting too much?","My (23F) boyfriend (23M) and I are long distance (across the pacific LD, so yay for time difference). We’ve been together for awhile now, and I’ve always had an issue with how he texts, or lack there of. 

I get that not everyone is glued to their phones, that they just aren’t great texters, and that’s fine. I can live with it. But my bf will stop responding all together sometimes. For example, last night we called for a little bit. I had to hang up cause I had made plans w a friend, but I said I would call back later, he said okay. Later comes, I text to make sure he’s still up and I let him know I would call in about 15 minutes. He said okay, but when I did, he didn’t answer, and he didn’t answer my texts, and we didn’t end up talking the rest of the night. I thought maybe he fell asleep, but I found out today that he was up and just busy. He got my texts but didn’t answer, so basically he ignored them. But he still could have texted me.. let me know that he was busy and he couldn’t talk, right? 

So today, we were on the phone and it was all good. I was frustrated a bit w last night (this stuff happens all the time, it’s not isolated occurrences, so I’m frustrated w it all), and when he said he had to go I was like “so you can get busy and not text me the rest of the day?” He naturally got upset (“oh give me a break!”) but we didn’t hang up on a bad note or anything, we made light of it and said our goodbyes as normal. 

I’ve tried talking to him many times to simply text me something like “hey I’m busy, won’t be able to talk”. It takes like 5 seconds! Instead of just not replying at all for the rest of the day or for hours at a time.. he did it once or twice but 99% of the time he doesn’t do it. Idk what to do, it’s just so frustrating cause I’m asking one simple thing of him. 

I also get we can’t text all day, I just get frustrated when he stops texting in the middle of convo or something like that. 

Am I being /that/ crazy girlfriend? Is it so much of me to ask him to let me know at least when he can’t text? It’s long distance.. we only have so much, you know? 

What else can I do?"
relationship_advice,This is continuation of my last post..I want to stop existing,"I was seeking answers on what I should do to make my family happy in my previous post.
The response I got was great. 

But nothing changed. In fact that I am so drowned in responsibilities now that I don't see future of myself anymore. 

My sister always taunts me even though we don't speak .she filled a form to a costly college even though she knows neither me or mom can afford it.  My mother doesn't even dare to speak against her. She dated couple of guys my mother knew it but never questioned it.

While am not allowed to have boyfriends. I never had one. All my life I worked and studied. I forgot that I had a life for myself.  

I wanted to make things better. Nothing worked. I am in love now but I don't see how I  will ever be with him because of all these responsibilities.  
I want all this to be over. 
No matter how much I do it's never enough and in return I never get respected enough. 

I am not even allowed to cry if something hurts me. 
I have been scolded for venting out. 

I wish it was better if I didn't exist at all.
I achieved a scholarship to study further but I can't even pay for it. Because I have nothing left for myself. 
I dont know what to do. 
Good advices are welcome. Don't pity me.

relationship_advice,What is your best advice in handling an amicable breakup?,[removed]
relationship_advice,The ongoing chore saga,"I do not want to leave my partner. That’s why I’m posting here. I am hoping somebody has a rational solution that perhaps we haven’t thought of yet. 

Me, 31. Him, 28. We are both whole ass adults. 

We both work full time (40 hrs at our corporate jobs). I also run a business that takes up a decent chunk of my life. I have to spend a lot of time working on my business. Answering emails, other admin tasks, lots of meetings, appointments, etc. It is my perception that I have far less time than he does. I spend maybe an hour a night just hanging out without having something else on the go. 

In contrast, he works full time, and used to wake up early for stock trading. Lately he has not been waking up early. He sleeps in, games a bit, goes to work, comes home, hits the bong, and then sits down at his computer and games some more. In the last week he has been staying up every night until 1 or 2am gaming. 

He takes his days off as true days off. Down time. Whereas I take my days off to do household chores like errands, shopping, laundry (we don’t have in house laundry) etc. 

The little down time I do have is spent mostly scrolling Instagram or doing other mindless crap to escape reality. (He hates it when I do that). 

But he blazes weed and then plays at least 4 hours of video games after work every single day. That can reach upwards of 8 hours of games on weekend days. Those are conservative numbers, too. Sometimes it is much longer. He does snowboard usually one day per weekend in the winter. But the time he clocks on games is astronomical.

I feel I am always the one in the household that has to remember things. We are out of toilet paper. We used the last of the ketchup. Chicken is on sale and we should stock up. Etc. 

I feel I do the vast majority of the “emotional labor” in our household. 

I am also the kind of person who cannot function in a house full of clutter and mess. Our place is tiny, about 550 square feet. I just simply cannot function, and it is very very important to me to have a clean space. He knows this. 

We have a small kitchen, we don’t even have a dining room, we eat at the coffee table etc. tiny. 

I have expressed time and time again (like, hundreds of times) how important it is to me that we have a clean, functioning apartment. We’ve tried so many different things to make this aspect of our relationship work. 

I do a lot of cooking, so when he doesn’t unload the dishwasher our tiny kitchen is mega cluttered and I can’t move around and it takes way longer for me to do anything. 

He prefers takeout and fast food. He will make eggs and toast on weekends but for the most part he buys lunch at a restaurant every day at work and buys dinner on his way home. When he does buy produce it often goes forgotten and rots, and I have to remind him to clean it out of the fridge. 

This all causes feelings of resentment, because as I am cooking or cleaning (or anything other than relaxing) he is sitting right there with his headset on, oblivious to the world around him. 

I feel like I have to beg him to pay full attention to me. I always feel like some invisible force is pulling him toward his computer. There are always voices coming out of the headset when he’s not there. 

Our biggest issue is cleaning. His perception is that I am some sort of OCD perfectionist and everything needs to be perfectly clean 100% of the time. 

Which is simply not true. But. I can’t relax when there is trash all around me. Again, our place is small and I just want a functioning household. One where there isn’t random garbage piling up everywhere. A 550 square foot apartment stinks up real quick if you leave garbage sitting around. 

He thinks it’s perfectly reasonable to come home from the store, leave everything he bought on the counter (very limited counter space, remember) including the grocery bag and receipt. He won’t put the stuff he bought away. He often leaves milk out on the counter overnight. He won’t recycle the receipt. He won’t put the grocery bag away in the cupboard. 

He thinks it’s perfectly reasonable to eat fast food or takeout and leave the wrappers there instead of just cleaning up after himself when he’s done. 

He thinks it’s perfectly reasonable to leave crusty dishes and condiments on his desk overnight. 

It’s like everywhere he goes and everything he riches he leaves a mess behind. 

He thinks I am just a horrendous nag and a crazy perfectionist. 

In my eyes, it’s the reasonable, responsible, adult thing to do to clean up after yourself right away. He always says he is relaxing and I shouldn’t nag him, that he’ll get to it. But in reality, he will never get to it unless i nag him. 

I’ve explained so many times how distressing it is for me to be the one who does most of the day to day cleaning. The one who does most of the household grind like remembering what’s in the cupboards. Filling the salt shaker. Making sure we have dish soap. 

I function way better when my living space is not in dirty, crusty chaos. I function better when I can come home and make dinner without having to first wash the pan he used to make eggs and toast 4 days ago. 

I am well aware that i can be a nag. And sometimes I get downright bitchy about it. You can only ask so many ways before it just gets to you and you freak out because you feel like you’re not being heard. We’ve tried chore charts. We’ve tried a 10 minute rule (clan for 10 minutes as soon as you get home BEFORE blazing and playing video games). I’ve tried having him set an alarm on his phone so that he remembers to do his 10 minutes of picking up after work. He says he set the alarm, but I know he didn’t actually. I’ve never heard it go off, anyway. 

Honestly I just get downright pissed and resentful. He is a CHILD in so many ways. And when I try to well and truly resolve this. I beg, I plead. Just give me TEN FUCKING MINUTES of your time, EVERYDAY. 10 FUCKING MINUTES to tidy up after your self! He doesn’t even want to do that. I ask him to do something and every. single. time. no. matter. what. There is SOME reason why he shouldn’t have to do it. SOME reason why he should just be able to relax instead of putting away the dishwasher. 

This gets to me because I don’t see a way out of this argument. I’ve suggested couples therapy and he we not receptive to that, either. I’m at my complete wits end. 

I do not think it’s unreasonable to pick up your trash in a timely fashion. I do not think it’s unreasonable to do ONE THING that would greatly improve your partners quality of life. Because honestly this is the number one huge huge huge problem in our relationship that weighs on my mind all day, everyday. And he knows how important it is to me. He KNOWS. He just disregards it because...? Because he’s lazy? Because he’s addicted to gaming (escapism?), because his mom isn’t a very clean person? 

“Oh, but wouldn’t that be ridiculous, throwing away your entire relationship because he won’t clean up after himself?” Nope. That wouldn’t be it. It would be throwing away our entire relationship because he doesn’t listen to me when I tell him how his actions make me feel. He doesn’t listen to me when I say that I cannot possibly have time for my full time job, running my business, and cleaning up after his slob ass. It would be throwing it away because he doesn’t listen to me when I tell him I don’t want to have children with him when he can’t even take care of himself. It would be throwing it away because I am wasting so much fucking time on his shit that I could be spending on bettering myself, or doing things that I want to do. It would be throwing it away because I DON’T FEEL HEARD, I DON’T FEEL SUPPORTED, I FEEL LIKE I ALREADY HAVE A CHILD, I FEEL LIKE MY TIME IS INFERIOR TO HIS, I FEEL LIKE MY TIME IS NOT VALUED.

“Oh, but, have you tried NOT cleaning up after him?” Yes. yes I fucking have. Many, many, many times. When I don’t clean up after him, we run out of dishes. I get crumbs between my toes. We run out of dishcloths. We get the most insane fruit fly invasions. 

HOW. HOW do we fix this. HOW do we work with this disagreement, this complete fucking failure to see eye-to-eye? Honestly to me all it would take - LITERALLY all it would take is for him to com me home, do a quick scan of the house and see what needs doing, do that thing for 10 minutes, and then I’d be a happy happy happy camper. He’d be free to do his own thing. Free of my nagging. It’s literally that simple. Why can’t he see it that way? 

Am I controlling because I want him to make time to care for his own household before he smokes weed and games? Is this what all men are like?"

relationship_advice,i want to visit my ex one last time,My ex and I were in a ldr. We broke up because of the distance and us falling apart. We have been messaging here and there. I know it won't work out but I want to visit him one more time. He did ask me if I wanted to visit him before but yesterday he said we should just both completely move on.

relationship_advice,Why was it so painful to break things off with a friends with benefits?,"I (20 F) just broke off a friends with benefits-type relationship (20 M) and I’m really hurting. We had both gotten out of two and three year relationships in September and started talking in late November. We started seeing each other consistently for the entirety of January and I was super happy with him. We met on Tinder. We slept together on our first date and we agreed that we felt an instant, genuine connection. He said he didn’t want a relationship on our first date, but I took it lightly and thought he could change his mind. We’re both in college, so he went home to another state for a 3-4 week long break and we still talked ALL the time. We became each other’s best friends in snapchat, we FaceTimed multiple times a day and were always texting throughout the day. I started to become attached and he was too. Then, as soon as school started up, he said he wanted to create more boundaries and said we should talk/see each other less and I was hurt because I got attached and got too comfortable. 

Cut to today. I felt like we had reached the “what are we” stage in our situation, so I wanted to have a serious and honest conversation about where we each saw this going. I wanted a relationship, he didn’t. He said he wants to be single for at least another year.  What made this so hard is that he was sending me mixed signals the entire time and it confused me a lot. We decided it was best just to end things to prevent future pain, as we really care about one another. 

We agreed that we can definitely leave the door open for a relationship in the future in the unlikely chance that we’ll cross paths again (we go to different schools in the same city). I guess this is so painful because we had such an intense connection and were intimate for such a short amount of time. Why am I hurting more than when I broke up with my ex of 2 years? Now I‘m starting to think that I want to be single for a while, as I haven’t been truly single since I was 16. 

Any advice for how to move from this and not immediately get into another relationship?"
relationship_advice,I (22F) slept with my best friend's younger brother (20M).,"I feel a visceral sense of shame, OK. Don't judge me and please give advice. (throwaway account, you understand)

So, the context is: My best friend's been out-of-state going to grad school, and we've sorta lost touch. I still (occasionally) hang out with her younger brother (Kyle) and his friends while trying to make sense of my (lack of) life. I've zero attraction to Kyle if I'm honest. But I hang out with his group of friends on a bi-monthly basis, while never being an integral part of his group (how i like it). Skip to: the other night, it was Kyle's friend's birthday, and I join in. It starts out a typical night, drinking, going out, dancing, kissing strangers, et cetera. Eight of us ended up at the last bar of the night, 30 minutes before closing. I don't know how drunk I was but I remember this: end of the night, Kyle touches my butt, I laugh, and jokingly pinch his butt back very hard. He looks me in the eye and he goes, ""Oh really? Do you wanna do this?"" and I go, ""What?"" And he whispers in my ear, ""I'll fuck you tonight, if you want to fuck tonight."" And I'm taken aback. But instead of following my instincts and saying, uhhhhhh no. I go, ""Uhhhhhhhhh, huh? I thought you were dating someone."" And he goes, ""No, I'm single. Do you wanna fuck or no?"" And, again, instead of following my gut and saying no, I go, ""I mean, I'm supposed to go home. Where am I supposed to spend the night?"" ""You can sleep at mine and nobody will know."" ""Uhhhhhh, IDKKK. Won't people talk?."" And that's where I let myself go along with having sex with him? Being uhhhhhhhhh, unfirm in my answers.

Thinking in retrospect, even drunk I was cognizant I wasn't interested in having sex. It wasn't like I was blacked out or anything. I've been celibate for a year, happily. And I just let it happen. As we were going to his place, I openly asked him for more booze to help me go along with it. He didn't seem bothered, just excited to sleep with me. The sex was terrible. My vagina was dry; he couldn't stay hard. I woke up feeling ashamed for letting it happen, for saying yes when I rightly should've said no. It wasn't rape ( he asked for consent, saying 'I'm all for consent,"" and I nodded yes.)

I'm normally (soberly) an assertive, self-assured person. I'm ashamed at myself for doing something I'd never do sober. And I'm worried this could affect my friendships were anyone to find out.

What should I do? I'm too ashamed to talk to my friends about it. To tell my best friend would be like suicided myself. How can I cope with this? How can I face his group of friends again?

relationship_advice,I (27M) am newly unemployed and torn between job interviewing and spending a week with LD GF (25F) for birthday and V-day,"In early January, I wound up being laid off by my company unexpectedly, forcing me to start looking for work. I have had some early success, and have lined up conversations with a few local companies to be held in the coming weeks, and I suspect that I will at least be a very strong candidate for these positions.

However, I had previously made prior plans to go see my LD girlfriend in February (together \~1 year), who lives nearly 2k miles away from me, under the assumption I would use PTO to go see her for her birthday and Valentine's Day. Due to my early success in landing interviews, I am currently stuck trying to figure out how to navigate the interviewing schedules of the companies who want to talk to me versus going on the trip that I had previously planned.

I have enough saved to cover all expenses for the trip and for many months of the year, however I do not want to stay unemployed very long, and these companies seem like my best opportunities for comparable or better employment than what I had. However, I am saddened by the prospect of telling my GF that I'm going to have to cancel the trip that was in the making for two months, especially when the plan was to celebrate our anniversary, V-day, and her birthday (which all fall within a 2 week timespan). The distance is very hard on her and she has voiced a lot of dissatisfaction with the fact that I am not physically there with her (she moved away to enter a PhD program, in a place where jobs in my industry are rare). I am caught between taking care of my employment needs and quite possibly our relationship, as I am not sure she would take a cancellation too well, especially at this time of the year.

I am torn on what to do, and I am running out of time to make a decision. I wasn't anticipating being in anything like this position when I made the plans, and I'm afraid that my circumstances could torpedo some possible job offers or my relationship."

relationship_advice,When to give up? My (23F) bf (25m) doesn’t act like he loves me,"I know he loves me, but he doesn’t show it as much anymore. I don’t know if I’ve fallen out of love or if I’m just tired of how comfortable he’s become in our relationship. I know how in love I’m capable of feeling with him and that makes me feel inclined to stay, but lately I’ve only felt resentment. When we broke up we’d see each other occasionally and he’d throw himself at me,  he’d make me feel wanted. When he’s drunk he’s kinky and emotionally open about how much he wants me. He’s been affectionate and we’ve gotten through a lot together.. I’ve never felt this way about previous partners. I know how committed he is, but these last few months he shows no emotion other than annoyance and I’m so fucking tired of the lack of romance. We aren’t physically intimate anymore, we don’t go on dates, he doesn’t kiss me romantically, he doesn’t compliment me, he doesn’t flirt with me, it feels like I’m always crying over the same thing. Our last argument he yelled “I’m breaking up with you” and I was so fed up I was thankful he’d said it. I’d been trying so hard to rebuild our relationship, hearing that shoved me over the edge. He called me over and over until I picked up. He said he only said it to get a reaction out of me and when I bring it up he says I’m not allowed to hold it against him because I’ve left him in the past. 

When I bring up my insecurity about the relationship he gets mad and says “I’m not doing enough, we argue too much for him to be intimate with me, he shows he loves me by being with me, it’s always about him etc.” I try to do sweet things for him. I make him lunches with notes, I clean up and leave his clothes out for him, I cook for him, I offer to buy him massages/games.

I tried to surprise him with a date tonight. I did my makeup really nice, bought our tickets, he showed up, showed no interest, we left early. I suggested we go to an arcade bar, he agrees, we get there and he just stares blindly, says he’s tired. We haven’t had a date in so long.. I’m disappointed but agree we should just go home. He becomes upset at me for being quiet, says he’s anxious, says he wants the night to be over, asks to go to sleep as soon as he gets home. 

Do relationships have an expiration date? We’re making plans to move and Ive been trying to reevaluate our relationship before I make a huge commitment like this. I’m scared and I don’t know what the right decision is. 

Should I try to work things out and if so, how should I approach him? How can I make him more comfortable in the relationship? 

Am I trying to fix something that will always level out to this? Should I leave? Should I talk to him about everything as a final effort (again) ?"
relationship_advice,My [21m] depressed GF [21f] refuses therapy even though she absolutely needs it!!!!,"Dating 19 months. I think we're doing ok. Our biggest problem is no sex in almost 7 months. I'm staying in the relationship hoping it'll change one day. Losing hope. Feeling depressed when we have sleepovers. 

We see each other once a week for a weekly date. We live 50 minutes away. In the beginning we would have sex on our sleepovers. That completely changed 7 months ago. 

She is depressed. She graduated nursing school 4 years ago and never really studied for her board exam. She worked part time as a CNA. 4 years later here she is working as a CNA with a nursing degree but no license. She did a review boot camp for a month recently but did not pass her board exam. 

I am also a nursing student. I have offered multiple times to have study dates. We can do practice questions together and compare answers. She just says ""maybe or I don't know"".

I know she is in a huge rut right now. She has told me she doesn't know what is going on in her life. And is a ""hopeless case"". She said that. 

She told me she has no libido and has no desire for sex anymore. I take care of myself well. I go the gym. I dress well. She always compliments me and tells me she is attracted to me. I'm confident her stress is killing her libido.

I asked her in the past for therapy and she declined.  Now i'm at a point where I think she either needs individual therapy or couples therapy. I recommended it tonight and she just simply says no. It's depressing because I feel like she has no desire to better herself or the relationship. And i'm over here SUPER passionate about us and our obstacles. She still receives handwritten letters and flowers from me monthly. She still holds me when we're out and about. Other than that the intimacy is gone. No sex. No making out.

She is immature for her age. I said it straight out. She lacks even basic communication skills. I explained to her in the beginning of our relationship and I have seen some improvement. But it;s still terrible. She refuses to talk in person face-to-face about issues. Only text. And if she feels like we are arguing over text she will turn off the read-receipts (I can't see she read my text) or she will ignore or BOTH. I'm very mature my age. You are more than welcome to tell me ""i'm full of myself"", however I'm very well aware of the effort I put into my relationship and the emotional maturity I possess. I work part time and am 1.5 years from graduating my own nursing program. While trying to maintain a loving relationship. 

The lack of sex and her lack of passion towards the relationship is really starting to make me consider if this relationship is worth it.

Any advice reddit?

TLDR: just read it please"
relationship_advice,I (24M) don't like my boyfriend's (23M) new behavior,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this because it's kinda gay not gonna lie.

What I'm saying is this is a gay relationship problem so idk if this is the right place to post but here we go

I've been out as gay since I was 12, but no one ever guesses I'm gay unless I say something. This is because I don't talk, walk, act, dress like a stereotypical gay man, I keep the body language to a minimum like straight men as well. All the gay stuff seemed super forced to me and I never understood why some gay men were like that. First glance you guess I'm straight, after years of knowing me, my friends still forget I'm gay.

I met my boyfriend 4 years ago when he was just coming out as gay, and now we've been together for 3 years. I didn't think about it then but now I guess I should have figured that since he was just coming out that version of him wasn't the final build if you get what I mean.

He recently has began to act more and more stereotypically gay, he refers to things as “she” &amp; “her”, his body language has become for flamboyant and feminine, he bought makeup and now everything about him is just different.

Now one or two of these things I could handle but all them are just too much for me. He was in the bedroom and I guess he dropped something because he let out this high pitched scream and I yelled “stop screaming like a fucking girl!” I know that wasn't how I should have reacted. 

All his friends are female and my friends are male and female, this means no mutual friends. His friends asked me how was everything and I thought my fake “great” was fine but they kept asking what was wrong, when I told his friends how I was feeling they ridiculed me telling how ridiculous I was and a horrible person I was being by not wanting him to be himself. 

For the record I'm not saying I only want to some super masculine guy and I'm not even saying I couldn't he with a feminine guy but I don't like this super gay behavior is all.

I don't like it but I also feel like an asshole for me feeling this way when he's just expressing himself, any advice?"
relationship_advice,relationships so complicated :(,"My boyfriend (21m) and I (21f) have been dating for about 16 months. Our relationship is dying, I’m working on improving myself by going to therapy once/twice a week (i’m a sexual assault victim). Friends have tried to force themselves onto me in the past. This is why I get v uncomfortable and lash out at my boyfriend when he hangs out with girls alone. Yes I’m aware of how messed up that is and I’ve been working on that...

He doesn’t attempt to reassure me and now does not tell me when he hangs out with women (because he’s scared). I feel horrible about how I’ve reacted, and now he hangs out with his female friends in secret...

However, not to excuse my actions. He has gone out with friends when we are together and not thought to invite me at all. Telling me I can go home or wait in his room (we don’t live together). This has hurt me and makes me feel like I’m not respected in the relationship. 

He called me a gremlin last week thinking it was cute..but I was hurt by this because I have been bullied because of my height (5’4”). He was leaving to Tahoe that weekend, and he suddenly started to feel v insecure. I reassured him and asked for him to send me a picture of him in Tahoe. He left to Tahoe with his club and did not send me a picture or anything and I lashed out after I had an anxiety attack...I just thought wow he can’t bother to send me a picture after I reassured him, right after he called me a gremlin and I told him it hurt my feelings :( 

I’ve never loved anyone like this before, after I was assaulted I told myself I wasn’t going to get in a relationship (before I met him)...because I felt so broken. I tried to break up with him awhile ago and he threw a tantrum ripping a bag out of my hands and throwing my clothes around the room.. I was scared...but I care about him...

We’re giving each other space right now...but I explained to him earlier one of his friends told me relationships are bs awhile back...He was mean to my boyfriend for awhile and he was a wreck...Now they’re friends again and I’m sure he’s suggesting we break up...

At this point I’m just going to work on dealing with my trauma and whatever happens...happens...

If you’ve been sexually assaulted and suddenly end up in a relationship...don’t bother...you just end up hurting them and yourself...it’s too painful..."
relationship_advice,How to comfort child (to-be sibling) after miscarriage?,"Hi! 
Today, someone very close to me had miscarriage. Naturally, she is devastated. It was very unexpected, but I don’t want to go into too much detail. Now, while I cannot even properly imagine the sadness and shock she must be going through, at least I somehow have some basic ideas about how to let her grieve and support her in the meantime. 
But she already has another child, recently turned four year old girl, who was very much looking forward to a sibling. And I (and I’m afraid no one else in our family) knows how to explain it to the girl that in the end... there will be no sister. Any ideas? While she is really small so I don’t want to unload stuff like “your sister died” on her, I’m also not sure if telling her something like “darling... your sister, she changed her mind and she’s not coming” will not hurt her as well, as she might start questioning why the sister didn’t want to join her. I don’t know. Any advice? Maybe being being straight-forward would be the best, but if someone has advice/tips/experience, it would be appreciated."
relationship_advice,"An older woman [50s?F] approached me [18M] in public and gave me her phone number, should I contact her? or what should I say??","
This incident happened today at while I was at work. I’ve been workinf at my job for roughly 2 years and I used to be a stocker then a freight worker then they recently let me work as an LP/Security member. So, I was by the door today because there was a person trying to walk out and I stayed out there for a few minutes.

Then there was an older woman who looked a lot older than me and even though she was in shape, she looked like she was in her 40s or 50s. When she was paying she looked at me and told me she thought I was attractive and I didn’t hear what she said at first so I asked her what and she repeated what she said and said she was just toying with me. 

When she was walking out, she gave me her phone number and called herself from my phone so she also has my number. Now I do want to see her, but I don’t want to seem desperate OR make her think I’m not interested. 

Should I call her or text her tomorrow? Or would it be too late or too soon? I don’t know what to do since I have no experience with girls at all and she is like 100x more used to this and I’ve never had a girl be so upfront with me like this. Thanks"
relationship_advice,Should I tell my bf I was high while talking to him on the phone?,"It was getting late, and I ate a piece of an edible before I was about to fall asleep. However, my newish bf then called, and we talked for a bit. I don’t  remember much about what  we talked about, but I feel like I must have come off weird. I am concerned I may have said some weird things, too. Should I tell him I was high that night, to explain why I was acting strange, or let it go?"
relationship_advice,I still think of my ex friend,My friend and I had been friends for 5 years. It was a codependent relationship and things ended badly. I tried reconnecting when I wasn’t ready. We both blocked each other but lately I’ve missed our relationship and the good memories. Having a friend I can be myself around. I want to reach out but I feel afraid and like it is an unwise decision but it’s killing me. What should I do?
relationship_advice,I think my boyfriend is lying to me. Should I confront him?,"I’ve got a tricky situation that I need some opinions on. I’ve (18F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (17M) for about 1.5 years now. We’ve been best friends since the seventh grade, and we tell each other everything. 

Back when I was in eighth grade, I suffered from PTSD due to trauma. As a result, a psychologist would visit me at school once a week to talk. I was going though a lot of anxiety attacks that caused me to pick at my fingers a lot.

To stop the finger picking, the psychologist gave me a blue, flat marble to play with when I started feeling anxious. For a few years, I used my marble quite often, especially at nighttime.

As I started to make more progress with overcoming PTSD, I started to need my marble less. However, I always kept it in my backpack because it’s comforting to have it around. Up until a few days ago, I hadn’t even looked at my marble in a very long time.

Anyway, the other day I started to feel the anxiety coming back (happens sometimes in recovery), so I went to look for my marble. It wasn’t in my backpack! I told my boyfriend about it, and he felt really bad for me. Since we’ve been in each other’s lives for so long, he has seen how important the marble is to me.

He assured me that he would look for it. I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend’s house, so he wanted to look for it there. I told him that he probably wouldn’t find it. I never use the marble at my boyfriend’s, so there’s no reason why I would lose it there. I told him he doesn’t have to look because I probably threw it away on accident (it’s a fairly small marble).

He told me he wanted to look anyway and asked me to send a picture of it. I didn’t have any pictures of my marble, so I found a similar one online and said it looks something like that.

Here’s where the suspected lie comes in. Today, when my boyfriend picked me up for school, he said he found my marble under his couch. I was so happy. However, when he handed it to me, I could tell it wasn’t mine. My marble was slightly larger and more rounded. When I pointed it out, he said, “that’s strange” and dropped the subject.

Upon relooking at my messages with him, I noticed that the picture I sent was from a sale website, meaning that my boyfriend could purchase a new marble. It seems very possible because they don’t cost very much at all (like $2 for a whole pack). It would explain why my marble looks very noticeably different.

I think that he replaced my marble. Normally, I would feel extremely upset if I suspected he was lying. However, this seems like he lied to help me and make me happy.

Should I confront him, or should I act like I didn’t notice?"
relationship_advice,How to express if both sides are hesitant?,"I am 21F and I met this guy at a concert and two other girls when I went there alone. We were having a great time and made a group chat after the concert to meet up for drinks later.

So, we met up at a game bar and were talking about a lot of stuff, getting to know each other and having fun.  The two girls went on separate ways and this guy and me were going the same way so we were talking on the way back till we parted. He came to Toronto as an exchange student and he was talking about the places he haven't been in Toronto yet before he leaves. That day I msged on group chat saying that since I am free and lives in Toronto (the two other girls don't), we can maybe hang out and go to places. He said it was a great idea and msged me privately to hang out at the Allen's garden and then to AGO museum.

It went great, talked about a lot of stuff and after the AGO museum, he said he had a meet up with his uni club society and asked if I would like to come along. First of all, I was surprised cause is it normal to bring an unknown person to a uni club meet up? I was like - what? for a while but politely declined saying it'd be too awkward for me. We parted ways and he msged me that same day that he had a great time and asked to meet up the next day at the aquarium but then later changed to meet up at a korean bar for dinner. The dinner went great. After the dinner, he asked if we go see the movies. I was taken aback for a while cause this was not in the plan but then said yeah why not.

During the movie, I felt asleep for a while cause I was tired...I think he noticed cause after the movie, he asked if I fell asleep which I denied and laughed it away LOL. That day, he did not msg me and I didn't as well..maybe I should have?  After a few days, he left back to his country. We are still good friends and he replies to my ig stories.

As someone with little experience in dating and liking someone, I think I was inexpressive with my feelings. Same goes for this guy too, he wasn't showing any signs that he was maybe interested in me? I think we were both really cautious to cross any any line that would not be considered as ""friends"". He also had a lot of female friends according to his ig so this made me overthink as well. What do you guys think?"
relationship_advice,I can’t tell if my boyfriend (M40) is lying to me (F30),"I’m in a relationship that has a history of being so complex that it’s almost impossible to summarise it in a succinct manner. 

Four years ago, I met my current boyfriend. He is ten years older than me - I’ve recently turned thirty, and he is about to turn forty. I lost my virginity to him. He was in a relationship at the time we met, and had a two-year-old daughter with his partner, who he was living with. But he kissed me, told me he had fallen in love with me, and told me he was breaking up with her and hadn’t been intimate with her for two years. 

Shortly after that, he told me they had officially broken up, and I started seeing him. We have been a constant in each other’s lives since the day we met, and I have loved him deeply.

But it has been increasingly complicated and painful. I found out he was lying about having broken up with his partner; she was simply staying at her mother’s house temporarily, as her mother was very unwell. I spoke to his partner and told her he had been seeing me and had lied to me, and after that, he cut me off and acted like I was the one who had done wrong by having contacted her. 

Eventually, he got back in touch with me, saying they had finally broken up for real - and I started seeing him again (after doing all I could to make sure he was telling the truth), only to find out he was still lying. He swore that he was simply sharing a house with her and that they had no intimacy, and that she was “seeing other men”, and that their separation was imminent. I said I would wait for him to prove this to me - by the time, we were two years into our “relationship”. He kept talking about our future and how in just a month, she would truly have moved out, and we could be together.

But something felt wrong - understandably, as he had already lied to me so much. And it was wrong. I managed to find out that his partner was pregnant with his baby. I was devastated and in shock and swore I would never speak to him or see him again. We cut contact, even though he kept telling me it had been a huge mistake, that the baby was a result of them having a drunken one night stand, that he still planned to leave her, and so on. I spoke to his partner and she was vicious and said she knew he had been seeing me but she didn’t care because she was “having his baby”. Her exact words were, “You are nothing - I am having his baby, haha”. It made me feel sick.

At this point, it had been three years since we first became involved. I didn’t think I would ever see him again and I started trying to heal and move on with my life. I tried to improve my self-esteem so I never let anything like this happen to me again. 

About a month after his new baby son was born, he contacted me, sent me love songs, told me he missed me. I tried to ignore him and dissuade him for several weeks. After having had my heart broken and having dealt with all that pain and finally started to move on with my life, it just felt like a tease for him to contact me telling me he still loved me. He also started telling me - again - that he was about to break up with his partner. I made screenshots of absolutely everything he said, anticipating that it was all more lies. The past few years had turned me into a completely different person, with zero trust.

I was traveling extensively overseas, but I agreed to see him when I returned, if he could provide absolute concrete proof beyond all doubt that he was for real this time. And he did. He brought me to his house and all his partner’s things were gone. She was gone. He let me stay as long as I wanted. He went through his custody arrangements with me, in depth. For the first time, it felt completely real.

But my ability to trust is now so damaged that I question everything he does, almost daily. He says he loves me and wants me to be his future and we are seeing each other and it seems like it is truly for real - but his mother is now terminally ill, and he says the fact that I question him so much is heartless of me when he is going through such a difficult time. He has made me feel I’m being selfish. But he also doesn’t want me to talk to his now ex-partner; I asked if I could confirm with her that everything is true, and he gets angry and snaps and says it will ruin outbound relationship and possibly ruin his relationship with his children if I make his ex mad by talking to her.

I am so invested and so close to this situation that I can no longer tell if he is lying. Maybe he is still lying about being broken up - maybe she is just living somewhere else - but how likely is that? I love this man so much and want to Ben my best self with him, but I can’t stop worrying that he is still lying. I don’t know how to trust him and I don’t know if I’m mad to even be giving this a shot after everything he has already done."
relationship_advice,"My parents are pestering me for not taking their MLM supplements since they spent a lot of money on them, but I don't want any of that shit in my body.","My parents are fucking iiiiidiots. They already were pretty insane but about ten years ago they began to buy from multiple MLMs, and continue to buy from a few. Whatever money I would have had for college (probably a year of tuition at the local community college) has now gone to nonsense garbage. This is why I got myself a bank account (rhymes with Dicks Lover) under my name so if I do get a scholarship check, my parents can't use it against me. Yo they are fucking INSANE and I'm moving far far away when I can.

They primarily buy from ItWorks, Isotonix, and Doterra. Mom likes using Rodan+Fields because it's skincare, and a lot of our cookware is Pampered Chef. ""Rodan+Fields is the best skincare on the market, Pampered Chef is good quality, Doterra oils are pure, and Isotonix is better than Walgreens!"" Yo I HATE the ""fat blockers"" because it makes my poop oily, and the Doterra oils burn my throat when I swallow them. And the notion that Isotonix supplements what has been lost in soil nutrition is absolute bonkers and that it's specifically made to be absorbed in the body is nonsense.

I found it weird that stuff we bought would be from family and sent to us but then I found out MLMs are pyramid schemes. I didn't even know what they were. And my parents actually think that the people we buy from are making money and the products/companies are legit. No they're not, and this is why I signed up for a chemistry and economics class.

And I learned that Isotonix is no better than CVS because everything that you ingest is processed by the liver. Soil depletion means I just gotta eat more. Essential oils should never be swallowed and the health claims they make are illegal. I wish I wasn't born to these nutcases.

They get on me for not taking the stuff they have spent thousands on, and are trying to guilt me because they said it night expire, but I said I had a right not to take it. They don't care, and still try to They claim I'm not adulting but I'm taking Khan academy classes, learning about personal finance, looking for a job, applying for scholarships (I HOPE I get one!), and am looking for a secured credit card to build credit. And I'm 18.

Bonus round: Dad thinks homeopathy and oils can treat coronavirus. No joke. And he legit believes that herbology and all that is valid because it's the original medicine and has been shown to cure the common cold, which ""science can't cure"". And went off on this long tangent that science can't entirely be trusted because ""it doesn't know how a bird instinctively knows to sing or a sea turtle to return to the ocean, it can't explain it"" and the same thing goes for homeopathy. I tried telling him that multiple studies have shown it to be ineffective but he says ""they're basing it off of stuff they don't know"" and ""homeopaths know best"" like they're some kind of witch doctors. I said ""I wish the condom didn't break"" to which my dad laughed hysterically at."
relationship_advice,Was this controlling of me?,"my boyfriend and i have been together 4 years, on our first aniversery, i broke down and expressed to him that him liking sexy pics of his old crushes on instagram made me feel very uncomfortable. I am way more secure with myself now and our relationship but i feel like i was bieng controlling maybe? he never liked another sexy pic after that and had no idea how i felt and cried and said he was sorry for making me feel bad. he only used to like sexy bikini pics and no ""normal pics"" of these girls or anyone else. my whole perspective was hey i get you look at people, but it makes me uncomfortable when your name pops up as liked on a sexy pic, its like actively telling this person you think shes hot in front of me. i dont mind looking but what makes you feel the need to show this girl you think shes hot, ya know? was this controlling behavior on my end? i never told him he cant do it but i expressed i was not comfortable with it. i do admit i was super insecure but even now i would still feel weird about it."
relationship_advice,Advice?,"Okay so I smoke weed. I’ve been smoking since before I started dating my bf. When we started talking to each other I was smoking. After a few weeks of us dating, he told me he hates that I smoke. I told him that Im sorry but it helps me with my anxiety. So, I stopped posting about it and stopped talking to him about me smoking because I knew it upset him. When my friends posted it, even tho I told them not to, he would get upset. So, they block him so he wouldn’t get upset at me. 

A few months go by and we argue about it and I decide to give it up. I didn’t smoke or drink for three or four months. Then I got a new job and they threw a party and my bf gave me permission to drink and smoke and have a good time, so I did. Then I wouldn’t smoke anymore. I missed smoking with my friends and my anxiety had started getting really bad so I said a compromise where I don’t smoke as often as I used to and I would quit drinking entirely. 

Well, it’s barely been a few weeks and we’ve been arguing again about it. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to quit because it genuinely helps me, and my bf said he won’t ever change his mind no matter what and that he hates it. I’ve tired to explain how it helps me but his mind is made up. Is there any compromises that you can think of to help both of us be at least a little happy and have both what he want?"

relationship_advice,I’m having dreams about other guys when I’m in a long term relationship,So I’ve been with my bf for 1 year and 6 months and lately I’ve been having dreams about other guys and it’s not always sexual dreams sometimes it’s just hanging out or we’re just talking but I still feel guilty. Idk what it is like me and my bf we do fight a lot but mostly cause we’re long distance most of the time but we see each other somewhat frequently. Sometimes I feel like he’s just not what I want but I do love him and want to be with him but these dreams make me think otherwise. Lately I’ve been feeling really lonely cause when we’re on the phone together sometimes it feels like we’re just off somehow like we haven’t really been spending a lot of time together and I know I can blame it on the distance but usually we’ll watch stuff and talk but lately he’s been focusing on video games more and working more plus he has school and it seems like when he does have time it’s never for me but rather for him to chill and do what he wants and play video games online with his friends. I just don’t know what to do cause I’ve been having these dreams frequently and I want them to stop I just want to be happy with him. Thanks to anyone who’s made it this far this is my first reddit post and probably the last but I just needed to get this off my chest.

She waited until they picked up my niece to tell that I shouldn't have painted nails. I explained to her that it wasn't a big deal and just a way to pass the time with my niece. She also got upset because I didn't take it off right away.

I obviously don't have nail polish remover on hand. Even if I did, I wasn't going to let a kid near it. To me all of this seems like a bigger deal than it needs to be, but I could be wrong. She then got even more mad when I told her that this wasn't a big deal.

Am I overlooking something and how would you go about dealing with the situation?

Thanks for the advice in advance."
relationship_advice,"Think I’ve just actually let my bf go, for good.","It hurts but I’ll be ok. I kept lying to myself thinking he actually loved me. Nah, I just think it was the situation and how comfortable we were with each other. He never respected me. Never protected me. Embarrassed me many times. Lied to my face. Cheated multiple times. Craves attention from other women. Always made me feel very unwanted when I’m a beautiful girl. But you live and you learn. You can’t make someone be the person you want them to be. If someone doesn’t wanna treat you right or they don’t feel you are worthy to be better for, just leave. It’ll never change. Trust me."

Plus we are broke,  due to horrible decisions. I have no family,  no real friends in the same state, have physical issues affecting my ability to work ( really bad arrhythmia) . She is the main money maker, I am primarily a stay at home dad with NO support.  I am way unhappy.  And she is so self absorbed,  something I noticed early on in our relationship (13 years) but convinced myself to love her unconditionally.  Now it's just fucked. I am trying to find solutions to help my arrhythmia, already tried ablation,  and pills ,but still have bad episodes.  (Probably anxiety due to relationship) I am needed to take care of everyone.  My wife has no domestic skills at all. Shes cold as ice. I feel shes a closeted lesbian, and is with me because of the shame of it. It's very hard to get anything but defensive attitude from her. We are so opposite its madness.  I know if I had money I'd be gone. I feel alone and helpless,  and resentful.  This shit sucks...."
relationship_advice,My GF (19F) was invited to a party and I (20M) was not.,"My GF of 5 months was invited to a party by a guy she went to school with many years ago.

 My GF seemed nervous when she told me she was invited to a party next weekend, and I just said cool, where? And she told me that this guy she went to school with 6 years ago had rented a local place in town. She then said that she could only bring one friend. So she said she is bringing her friend Emma. And I asked why not me? And then she said that the host told her that there were so many guys there already that they wanted more girls.

Should I be worried? Why would she want to go to a random party with a guy she barely knows, and barely talks to..

Note: She always wants to bring me to parties she attends, this is a first where she wants to go ¨alone¨. I also got a glimpse of a message she sent him. ¨I can get my boyfriend to drive us, no problem so we don't need a taxi.¨ - Without asking me btw, she said this to him."
relationship_advice,Is my coworker taking advantage of me?,"My coworker (37M) always talks about how he doesn’t have any money, he collects disability from being a veteran. Me (21F). He takes me too and from work and I live 3 miles from work, not that much trouble to pick me up but he likes to hold it over my head. I work part time so he picks me up 3-4 days a week and every two weeks I give him 20$ to do so. I don’t make much money and In the past I used to give him around 25-30$ until I talked to my family about it and they said that’s too much money. 10$ seems really reasonable but sometimes I feel like I don’t know how gas works because I’ve never had a car. What’s your opinion?"
relationship_advice,"How to give my husband his love language [physical touch] when I'm severely disabled for at least 6 weeks, and how to make him know how special he is to me?","A little over a week ago, I underwent major surgery, hours away from home. During the surgery the surgeon accidentally broke my pelvis. 

I have been in OT and PT in the hospital, will have a care-giver at home, and OT and PT that comes to my home.

Here's the thing - I didn't get to see my husband for several months (has to do with his work), and he is touch-starved. Being down here for my surgery to help care for our toddler is the first time he has been able to see me in some time.

I want so bad to hold him, have sex, rub his back, make him feel loved.

I'm pretty much glued to the bed, with PT excercises in bed, and OT and PT outside it with professional help. 

I go home from the hospital tomorrow. I have to sleep in a bed that is as close to ""sterile"" as possible, because of my surgical wound and already having obtained an infection that's healing. So he won't even be able to get into bed with me to snuggle.

What should I do? 

My main love language is quality time(well, sometimes tied with physical touch) , and so talking with him intimately makes me feel loved. But how can I make him feel loved?

He is going to have so much more responsibility now to help take care of me, although I am lucky to have some outside help, but still it'll be a lot. 

I just want him to feel precious, loved, cared for, appreciated, adored, and wanted. 

I don't want this to have a negative impact on our relationship. Especially as over the next 6 weeks, I'm not even allowed to put my foot down on the floor due to the injury needing to heal. 

It will feel like we are in the same room yet separated.

Help please."
relationship_advice,I (M 24) need help getting a girlfriend and need advice.,"I’ve reached the point in my life where I need to settle down and get a girlfriend and then hopefully married! However I have never dated before or been in a relationship.

I’m looking for a specific kind of a girl to date but I’m not sure how much or how little I should determine the importance of those things. I have been told to never settle but I feel like the “ideal” woman would be one in a billion and then there is the possibility that she doesn’t even like me lol.

Then there is the fact I suck at picking up signals from women. There was a girl in my class last quarter that I had a major crush on and I just realized a few days ago that she left me an opportunity to get to know her better but I completely blew it. I always can never tell if a girl is just being nice to me or is actually in to me. So I thought maybe online dating would be an avenue to try because there is no beating around the bush about intentions but I hate setting up profiles. I’m a very anti-picture person in the fact that I hate photos of myself. I don’t think I’m ugly but I literally have 0 photos of myself and I never take pictures. Plus, I never know what to say. 

I know I’m ready for a relationship and I want to settle down but trying to balance what I want in a woman, picking up on interest from women, and putting myself out there in the dating world has become very overwhelming. I keep hoping that a beautiful woman comes and knocks on my door one day and makes me her boyfriend but that most likely won’t happen lol. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
relationship_advice,Dealing with insecurities,"I'll try to make this as short and succinct as possible. I've been dating a girl for about 3 months now and it's been without question the healthiest relationship of my life. She's understanding, beautiful, funny, smart, all the cliche things that are cliche for a reason. But this isn't about that.

I have had 3 sexual partners in my life and I am 33. More than fine with me. I've always been in a relationship while having sex, never a 1 night stand. My new girlfriend has been with quite a few guys. I don't know the number, but we have talked about it a few times, just getting to know each others past a bit and getting to know each other more. 

Before anyone loses their shit, I am fully aware this is a ""me"" issue. She could have had a 1 night stand every day till she met me, it's none of my business what she did or with whom before me. I can also recognize that if I DID have the opportunity to have 1 night stands, I absolutely would have. I understand the hypocrisy completely. I was just an introvert that never really went out or tried to have sex.

I don't want to ruin the relationship because of my insecurities. I've also asked her if she misses those days and having 1 night stands, and she says no. She's more than happy that they are over and that she met me.

Can anyone shed some light or give any advice as to how I can get by this, as it's completely on me and not her? There are days when I dont think about it then BAM hits me an I kinda feel shitty for feeling shitty about it, as I have no right. Anyway, any help would be appreciated. 

TL;DR man insecure about the amount of sexual partners his new girlfriend has had. Don't know the exact number, don't want to know."
relationship_advice,Anxiety &amp; relationships don’t mix,"My partner told me tonight my anxiety is the biggest issue in our relationship. I committed to not talking about my anxiety anymore to save the relationship. Is this going to work out? We both really want it to, we just both decided talking about my anxiety was unproductive and harmful to the relationship."
relationship_advice,My (19F) boyfriend (20M) doesn't want me to go on his upcoming bday trip bc i'm not that sociable,"My SO told me his family recently booked a trip overseas. I've always wanted to go to the place, especially with my SO, so I asked him if I could come as well. He said that his extended family will probably also come. And since I tend to be extremely shy and closed up in group gatherings, he said it's better if I don't tag along for this trip unless I do a complete 180 on my personality. We've been together for almost 2 years now and this really upset me. All I wanted was to be there for his birthday and enjoy the trip with his family. Any tips on how to talk to people? Should I just not come at all? Will I ruin the trip if I still go?"
relationship_advice,Boyfriend of two year has been feeling depressed . Came out he still has issues from his ex. I suggested he talk to her after all this time and get some type of closure/reassurance. Was it an appropriate suggestion and would it help?,"On mobile so I apologise for any grammar mistakes. So this is going to be a bit lengthy but please bare with me. Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost two years now. We both came from horribly abusive relationships. Mine was mental, physical, and emotional abuse. My boyfriends ex was emotionally abusive, a liar and a master manipulater.  When they first got together she even warned him she was a chronic cheater that she never has stayed faithful in any of her relationships. So eventually twoard the end of his relationship he found out she cheated but despite catching her in lies, her contradicting herself and him having proof she remained addament she never cheated. By that point he was done with her. He took care of her in everyway.they lived together and he paid all the bills, all the groceries, paid her car insurance on top of his, drove her around to wherever she wanted, did whatever she wanted. He basically catered to her and she didn't do anything in return. She wouldn't clean, cook, didn't have a job, spent any money he gave her on drugs, and other frivolous things. Let's put it this way, when one of his close friends lost his mother she didn't want him to go because she wanted to run errands to the store. She even fought him on it until he put his foot down. She tried her best to allienate him from his friends and his family his own mother didn't see him for years because of her. She was not a good person.

Now fast forward to two months after they broke up and three months after I broke up with my ex. We met through a mutual friend and it was magic. Didn't even feel like a first meeting. It felt like we were just saying hello again. Instant connection. Almost two years later we have a house and I may be pregnant. Our families love us and each other. It's amazing however here comes the problem. My boyfriend when we first met was sure he didn't have any baggage. I know I had some issues but I worked through them. But for the last six months I've noticed him change. He's more depressed, feels he has to lie to me about certain things like porn.he also was never allowed to view that stuff when he was with his ex. She gave him hell for it even though she was the one who didn't want to have sex most the time and when she did she was always clothed and always missionary. He's told other white lies to like what he's spent our money on. Nothing major just like games and snack and stuff like that but a lie non the less. He wasn't allowed to have friends or play his PC when with her and with me I don't care as long as he at least manages his time to where we can still at least chat about our days for an hour or watch TV for a bit. He hasn't had that freedom in a while and still is learning to manage his time. But in the past six months with him being depressed, I feel like I have to compete for his time bc his way to destress is playing his computer. Our sex life has been up and down because of his stress and being depressed. We've also been having communication issues. 

We recently got into an argument and it came out that the issues we've been having are because of stigma left behind by his ex. He told me he has to remind himself everyday that it wasn't his fault his ex was crap to him and that he's allowed to be happy. He doesn't want me to start going off on him like she did, or feel like I'm unhappy. 

 With us having a house together and me possibly pregnant and us thinking of marriage and forever together I told him things can't keep going how they are if that's what's going on in hisnhead.Because eventually our issues could get worse and things could go down hill. He needs a better way to work through his left over baggage. 
 
When me and my bf got together my ex tried talking to me again. Apologized and what not. But when I said thank you but I've moved on, my ex reverted back to the same abusive jerk I knew. And that for me just helped solidify the truth that I wasn't crazy I didn't deserve the punches or slaps he gave or the hurtful things he spewed. It helped me fully do away with my so much of my baggage. 

Now the reason I'm posting. After we spent hours talking about his confession that he does have left over issues from his ex and that's where our problems are steaming from. I suggested therapy or even talking to his ex again to get actual closure. Rather she admits what she did and apologies or acts how she use to and get huffy and mad and denying he'll still get the reminder from her what happened wasn't his fault and he did all he could and he's allowed to be happy now. He said he's willing to try anything to get over his mental block and I told him whatever he wants to do I'll support but obviously something needs to be done. Thing is with therapy though he's had some bad expierences in the past because when he was with his ex he did try going because he got really depressed being with her and when he tried all they wanted to do was tell him how to feel and shove pills at him. He's still willing to try therapy again but if he had a bad expierence I don't want to push him with therapy. I just really want to find someway to help him or some way he can help himself. 

Did I do the right thing  by suggesting he talk to his ex? And would it actually help him like it helped me? We both love each other and agree this is forever no matter what. I just want him to stop hurting and thinking things like hes not allowed to be happybecause some non existent shoe is gonna drop. I want the issues we have to go away. We are in an overall healthy loving relationship but for things to continue to move forward he needs to find a way to actually start healing the wounds she left. I can do all I can but somethings people have to do on their own. And we both agree that I've done a lot but I can't do much more because it's mental scars she left. Just at a loss at what he should do. I care and love him so much and it breaks my heart he has these thoughts and he hasn't really healed the hurt she caused. He said being with me is the happiest he's ever been and in a lot of ways I've helped him but he still has issues from her. 

Edit: boyfriend of two years feels depressed and it came out he has baggage from his ex. We have a house together and a possible baby on the way. (Dr appointment coming up to confirm) suggested he get in touch with his ex to get closure/reassurance it wasn't his fault and he's allowed to be happy. Therapy may be an option but he's had a bad expierence in the past. Was suggestion talking to his ex a good idea? What other things could help him?"
relationship_advice,Best way to make a conversation actually go somewhere?,"I'm (18M) talking to a guy (20M). We have a lot of history but just recently started talking again after ten or so months of not interacting beyond liking each other's Instagram posts. We've been friends for years, dated for a bit, but eventually stopped talking after breaking up. It wasn't a bad breakup, but neither of us really knew how to act. Regardless, we know each other really well, so it's not like we're uncomfortable, and we do enjoy talking to each other, but our conversations die really fast. I tend to message first a little more often and try a bit harder in conversations, but he's always been less conversational than me, even when we dated, but it wasn't an issue before. It's a little worse now, but he still always responds to my messages pretty fast, even if it's somewhat dry. But even if he's talking just as much as I am, it just feels like we run out of things to talk about. This isn't an issue in person or on the phone, though. How do I bring up more topics and continue the conversation without it feeling forced? Should I keep trying as much as I do when we talk?"
relationship_advice,How do I overcome my anxiety to talk to girls,"I’ve been up for 3 hours later than usual and I can’t sleep. Basically I asked a girl I liked to a school dance, we’re both fifteen and introverted as hell so we have barely any social experience let alone dancing or being open in large public events. During the event it becomes very awkward very fast and I’m being eaten from the inside out from all of this built up guilt I have, and out of the blue three months later she messages me that she’s sorry for being so distant which is what I thought I was doing to her and we’ve talked around twice since. We weren’t dating and we’ve talked a lot over text and have had two short conversations 3 months ago in person. I really think I should talk to her in person tomorrow to make the situation less awkward but I can’t work up enough courage to overcome the anxiety of being judged. Please help any advice at all, having an outcome of a relationship is optional just if I’m able to repair it to being good friends that would be swell too."
relationship_advice,Will my boyfriend ever stop looking at/paying for porn?,"I am struggling in my relationship of going on 3 years, with a man who has given me a promise ring talks about proposal, marriage, kids, the whole nine yards. Everything is great(except maybe he could clean a damn thing every once in a while) but there one thing that I just at this point feel like I need to accept or realize I’m just not ok with.
To keep it to the point:
-Started dating &amp; he was very honest that his last relationship ended because he cheated on his girlfriend (has mentioned things like he lost  sexual interest in his ex and looking at girls on Instagram was a factor in causing him to crave more sexually and tainted his view on a womans body - but only while he was super active on it)
-I catch him with porn- no biggie I get it all guys do it I didn’t make a big deal out of it until ...
- I catch him on Only Fans spends over $200 in less than 3 weeks of using the app and he lies to me about it
Ok I’m not comfortable and voice that it seems like a problem/possible addiction? We agree that he’ll tone it down 
-I find another site, I forget what’s it’s called patreon? 
-I find more pictures 
- I find search history on Instagram of the countless basically naked woman porn star accounts 
Then he comments that he can’t wait for me to get my boobs done one day 
Now I’m sitting here again seeing more girls on his Instagram telling myself not to be upset but knowing it doesn’t feel right 

Do all men really always look at porn? If he’s clearing not stopping do I accept it ? Its not affecting our sex life
I can’t imagine walking away from something so good because he can’t stop looking something that seems like just a guy habit I guess 

Short summary; caught boyfriend looking &amp;paying for porn I’ve voiced that it makes me uncomfortable he’s made comments that make me slightly insecure, do I just need to accept it or not?"
relationship_advice,Is it bad that I dont want to be intimate with girlfriend after she was sexually assaulted?,Girlfriend had been touched inappropriately last weekend and I will be seeing her soon but am grossed out/disgusted (awfully wrongfully so) and don’t want to get sexual. Is that bad?
relationship_advice,I’m in Grade 12 and have no friends,"I’m usually used for something and when I offer no value then I’m treated badly. I have two good friends but they’re super popular and prefer talking to their other friends. 
Litterly the only thing I can trust is reddit. 
I stopped letting people use me and since then people stopped wanting to see me. I stopped paying and driving friends everywhere. 
I am a musician and the first time I performed none of my friends wanted to go, except one, she came because she said only if i got her dinner after, so I did.
I know so many people but no one wants to be close to me. Even the men I dated, they just wanted sex. 

My personality is very kind. I always please customers where I work and the customers love me! I love people who talk fluently and formally. I been walked over so many times that now I don’t like it when people get too comfortable around me, I guess that’s why I prefer speaking in formal/proper manner/etiquette.  

I only go to school in afternoons because I finished all my classes so I don’t have to worry about where to sit at lunch. I’m just worried that I’m graduating and leaving school without the connections I was supposed to make. And leaving to fight a musical journey with no one to lean on.
I love being alone because then I’m free, but at the same time there’s this horrid loneliness that creeps around me. 

If you can give me advice on making friends that value me please do, but I think advice to cope with the feeling of loneliness would be much more useful. 

Thanks!!"

relationship_advice,ThrowRA Was I(21f) sexually assaulted by my(21) boyfriend?,"Extreme Trigger warning, also I don't mean to sound insensitive to people who have gone through these traumatic experiences by asking this question, but this occurred years ago and I genuinely don't know what to think about it all. Also this is a throwaway, because I feel really anxious about revealing all of this. A few weeks into when my boyfriend and I first started dating two years ago, we were at his best friends apartment drinking. I didn't plan on drinking very much but I remember both of them being really ""encouraging"" about pouring another drink. Late that night I remember going to the bathroom and when I came out my boyfriends friend had closed his door and my boyfriend led me to the couch saying I could sleep there for the night. I began throwing up and then I blacked out. Then I remember ""waking up"" several times through out the night to him being on top of me, even once at 4 AM hours later where I'm sure I would have been asleep. We had never done anything sexual before that night, and the next day he was very adamant about us spending the day together because I was feeling really sick, and I told him I blacked out and he just laughed saying ""he couldn't tell"". I have thought about it a few times through out the years but I always push these thoughts away because I just can't imagine him as being the type to do something like that. But somehow it was brought up today and he made a joke about how I climbed on his lap and ""initiated"" everything, but again I have no memories of that, and I know when I start to throw up from being too drunk and blackout (its happened quite a few times, unfortunately), I cannot even hold my head up let alone my body. I know I can't expect you guys to tell me with any ounce of certainty that it was a sexual assault, because even I don't remember all of what happened, but I guess my question is, If I feel so strongly that something clearly nonconsensual happened, then am I disrespecting myself by remaining in a relationship with the man who potentially did it?  Or maybe there's something to be said about both of our behaviors being inappropriate that night? I'm sorry to be writing this all, I honestly want to just delete this but, here goes"
relationship_advice,I (m19) am currently living with my mom but have made almost 400 thousand through investing. How do I get out of the scenario where she thinks I’m greedy or hiding stuff?,"Context: since I was 18 I started investing a few hundred every month, lost a lot, but ultimately ended up making a shit ton. I live poor and my mom doesn’t have much money so I eat at home, rarely buy new clothes, and don’t even have a car. 


My moms very stingy with money so how am I supposed to just all of the sudden by a new car and move out without her starting arguments about where I got money, how much money I have, etc?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend was a babysitter,"Let me (M25) start by saying  my girlfriends dad died when she was young. (Under 5) Anyway, my girlfriend(24) of over 5 years now, used to babysit two families. Neither of the dads were very attractive, but recently I just overheard her say she had a crush on one of the dads. Which was totally unexpected because this guy was not good looking, and also had the humor of an ant. So, that was whatever. Everybody has crushes. But I just remembered that we had the other family’s, dads car because hers was totaled. On the GPS in recent destinations, was my girlfriends address. She said she didn’t know what that was about and that she was creeped out. I persisted and she just got upset that I wouldn’t drop it. I didn’t think anything of it because this dad was even less appealing than the one she had a crush on. 

She is a very nice person and has an actually sweet, kind heart, but now I’m completely in my head that something was going on there, maybe because of some unresolved dad issues, or something? Within the first year of us dating I caught her texting her ex. I was unabashedly not a good boyfriend then (treated her more like a guy friend, was very insecure about everything, etc...), so after awhile I understood why that happened. This has been our only really hiccup in the entire relationship. I can’t accuse her or ask about it, because that’s me not trusting her. I’m not sure what to do, but it’s eating me alive. 

I 100% realize this could be a complete fabrication of my mind. I am admittedly insecure. Not to a crazy extent, just enough to keep me on edge. Any thoughts?"

For the past year I've been working from an office about 30 minutes away and he changed jobs too so our commute time is pretty much the same now but I still find that I'm doing the vast majority of the household chores which is ok but what's really frustrating is when I've been at work all day and he's had the day off, he still waits for me to get home so I can make dinner.

I've voiced this to him multiple times but nothing changes. I'm not a fussy eater and he knows how to cook some dishes.

Is it too much to ask for him to take care of dinner once in a blue moon??"
relationship_advice,just help pls,"This isn't really relationship advice since im a tiny little 8th grader, I just have this awkward situation that I would like some help with. I went to the mall with two of my friends, and we met up with three other friends there. Just to get this straight, I'm a straight girl, the two people I went with were girls and one of them is basically les, and the people we met up with were three straight guys. 

It was a fun trip but afterwards, the two friends and I (I'll call them A and B) were at my house for a bit. We got a text from one of the guys, who is a total dickhead. (We'll call him C) C said that his friend (D) thought I was cute (so he sold him out. bruhh) and then texted B and asked her out right off the bat lmao. (C's just like that) I kind of just went on with my life and stuff, but apparently A told D that I knew he thought I was cute. Which is bad for me, because I hung out with him a bit. I dont want him to think I changed how I acted and i dont want things to get awkward. 

I've been texting A and she said that she'll basically just talk to him about it and tell him that I just want to be friends. (I'm pretty sure he just wants to be friends too and I have a reason for that) but I still feel like it'll be awkward. 

I know this probably isn't the right subreddit at all

And I guess what I'm asking is, how do I un-awkwardify this? Is that possible? Hes a super nice person and I really wanna be friends with him"

relationship_advice,I’m (23F) burned out trying to support a coworker (49F) in an abusive relationship. How can I help her better?,"I (23F) met my coworker Elizabeth (49F) six years ago when we both worked in the same office. I’ve since moved jobs but we stayed really close and over time developed a mother/daughter or aunt/niece-type relationship. 

Elizabeth has been in a volatile relationship with her partner of eight or nine years, Rich (40s M), ever since I’ve known her. The relationship is extremely abusive. Rich easily makes five times what Elizabeth does and he is very controlling financially. During the relationship, he has been caught cheating with coworkers, escorts, and his hairdresser. He has two ex-wives and three children that he barely maintains a relationship with. He is a pathological liar and disappears constantly doing who knows what. Worst of all, he is physically abusive to Elizabeth. He has beat her, choked her, and even grabbed her small dog in front of her. She has a entire hidden folder of pictures of her injuries but has never taken them to the police. She confides in me almost daily about their relationship.

Over the years, he has left her many times to be with other women, with the most recent break-up happening this past September. Each time she became nearly catatonic. She took absences from work, drained her savings, and begged and pleaded for him to come back. Elizabeth has no family or children as she was adopted and her adoptive parents are now both deceased. She is reliant financially on him as her income is not enough to cover the household bills and she will not move to a smaller place as she lives in her childhood home, which is extremely sentimental to her. She also seems to have extremely low self-esteem and believes that at her age she will not be able to find someone else. 

Throughout the years I have spent countless hours advising her to seek counselling, to reevaluate the relationship, to report the abuse, etc; for a long time I simply listened and let her vent but after a long period of watching the abusive cycle continue I started to slowly add suggestions for ways to her to gain her independence from him. After a few years of that and seeing no change I started being more frank and would tell her that I hated him and thought the relationship was abusive, codependent, and disturbing. She does not listen to me. She does not want to be independent from him. She still desperately wants to be with him.

Now he is dangling the carrot of maybe getting back together but he has decided that he would like her to sell her home and everything in it, including her clothes and shoes (!!!), to start a new life with him in a new house “for a fresh start”. I think this is a HORRIBLE idea and that he is going to succeed in stripping her of the last thing that is truly hers (her home) and isolating her from the few people she has left in her life. I expressed my concern but she is CONSIDERING IT. Even when I pointed out the huge financial impracticality of buying all new household things she still kept saying she wanted to think about it.

I am burned out. I don’t know what else to do to help her and I feel like worrying about her is becoming detrimental to my own mental health because I now dread seeing her messages and taking her calls because I know all she wants to do is vent or cry about how she misses him and hopes he will come back. I worry that he will take it one step too far and one day and will seriously injure her or kill her. How do I support her going forward without making it sound like I support the relationship rebuilding because I DO NOT?"
relationship_advice,"Long distance round 2, not sure how to handle it","Backstory: me (21M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together around 9 years, started dating real young after being friends online for a couple years. We were long distance for about six of those years until I moved out to where she’s from for college (even though that wasn’t my first choice to live/go to school but that’s another story). So we’ve been living together ever since and spending pretty much all our time together. 

The issue: 
after college, she wasn’t set on her intended career path and decided to pursue an internship with a large company 3 hours away from where we live now. Admittedly I gave her a hard time on this, as I wasn’t ready to be long distance again after six years of it not to mention the fact that I’ve been clear on not wanting to stay where we live now after college. But I ended up feeling guilty bc the internship is with her dream company, and I realized it wasn’t my place to sway her one way or the other. 
Flash forward to now, she’s having a hard time being apart among other things and I’ve been persistent that she stick with it and give it some time to get adjusted. I haven’t felt like I can truly weigh in on how I feel about the situation, especially when I wasn’t supportive when she first broke the news that she was pursuing this. I’ve been as optimistic as I can be, but mentally it’s starting to weigh on me because I’d much rather be with her and out of the state like originally planned, but things haven’t gone as such. 
We’ve talked about moving after the internship and agreed that that is on the table, but it’s been hard to be supportive/optimistic when she’s constantly debating on staying or leaving and not taking care of herself mentally/physically due to the stress of the new living situation. 
Part of me wants to tell her to quit if it’s coming to a point where she can’t even bring herself to eat some days, but part of me knows I should be convincing her to stay bc this is her dream and a great opportunity.  I’m not handling it the best, nor do I enjoy being without her but I feel guilty for feeling that way or even expressing that to her, all things considered. Any thoughts on how to reach a compromise or a happy medium for the time being? It’s not a break up situation, but I’d appreciate any tips on how to deal or if anyone has gone through the same thing. I know I can’t be crazy for feeling a little frustrated/disillusioned with the whole thing. 

Additional backstory: the internship is for 6 months, I have transportation to visit, I have a full time 9-5 job and the internship has her working odd hours, so weekends are potentially off the table because her schedule changes from week to week"
relationship_advice,I think im kinda stuck with a sad loop of talking with people online and if i find them interesting they leave me?,"I don’t have problem with talking with people online. But offline I hardly talk. I do have friends but I don’t feel energetic enough to talk. Talking online is kinds my safe place and i did meet some amazing people but when they leave it hurts. Like you’re talking for some days and then other person stop talking becoz of various reasons which I understand but it makes me feel sad. Like im not comfortable with my personal information take. Out becoz of various reasons but im not asking anyone either. I think trust needs time to build.
But then again talking with someone and then not talking anymore makes me sad and. I want to stop doing it. I want to stop filling my gap by talking with people but I LOVE TALKING. And idk what to do anymore. 
Can anyone tell me what to do?"
relationship_advice,I 24[M] had sex with a close friend of the girl [20F] I just started dating.,"So for a couple of years I have been in love with an amazing girl, who is basically everything I have been looking for all my life. We became best friends and I told her how I felt about a year and a half ago.

A couple of weeks ago, a close friend of her and I met in my apartment and we agreed that we were going to have sex because we were both bored and did not have anything else to do. We agreed to keep it a secret but now since 2-3 weeks ago the girl of my dreams is FINALLY giving me a chance and we are dating after me waiting for this for so long. But I feel guilty of not telling her that before we started dating I slept with one of her close friends out of boredom.

Am I lying to her? I don’t wanna mess this up"
relationship_advice,"My boyfriend critiques my gameplay, how do I get him to stop?","So when me and my boyfriend first start playing a new game together it's fun and enjoyable. However as we start to play it more, his competitiveness/seriousness takes over and he focuses on winning. Then he starts critiquing my gameplay and harps on my performance. It's mixed in with jokes here and there, but its sort of unpleasant. I don't like that kind of playstyle of holding me to a standard and ""teaching me how to play"" if you catch my drift. It makes me feel like crap. I've already brought this up with him multiple times and he understands that he's being rude, but he doesn't seem to stop. However I really just want him to understand my point of view and come around because gaming is a huge part of both of our lives and we don't want to stop.

I decided to only play certain kinds of games with him that weren't too competitive and were still co-op but I'm beginning to understand that he's always like this no matter how competitive the game is. We tried playing sea of thieves tonight and all I heard from him was ""I told you to steer the ship, why aren't you steering it properly, we're heading into a rock again and I can't leave you alone for one second"" or ""why did you abandon the wheel I told you to steer"" and I just said I'm trying to help. I even explained to him that we just have a skill difference. I just feel like crap and it's not fun being told what to do (even if I'm not playing very well)


We played Grand theft auto 5 in the past because of the free roam ability, where him and I just goofed off for hours. It was super duper fun for about one day, and then the next day it was him complaining about how I can't drive the helicopter very well, or shoot well enough, or being criticized for not knowing how to get missions done. I stopped playing GTA with him and it is now banned from our rotation because it was too unpleasant. He knows why I won't play GTA with him and he thinks that if I just give him one more shot he will be nice and not be a jerk.

I don't want you to get the wrong impression of him. He's not a horrible person to be around. He likes laughing and joking and having fun too. And sometimes he even gives me a compliment and tries to do what I want. I just don't know what to tell him or how to make him see that he's being too critical.
We can play civilization 6 together and it goes great but it's been overplayed recently and were branching out to new games. If we are playing against each other he is chill."
relationship_advice,"I was nice to a new co-worker and now he thinks I want his dick, what the actual fuck?","I'm a mix of angry and confused with a hint of betrayal that this fucking idiot would even fabricate such garbage in his cave-man brain. Basically a new guy showed up at our workplace and I was being nice/polite to him because that's what I do. I was never interested in him, in fact I thought he looked like some type of neckbeard pirate: he wears a bandana, has a braided goatee, ear piercings, sailor tattoos, while having greasy skin, patchy neckbeard, and talks like a robot trying to assimilate as a human.

M'Captain hardly talked to me that much when I spoke to him in the first place. I greeted him a couple of times and had small talk where he wouldn't make eye contact with me hence I thought I made him uncomfortable so I would just greet him. Fast forward to now and I've heard him telling people I've been ""hitting"" on him and want to have sex with him. It feels incredibly rude and insulting that he literally turned up, acted weird, then started this shit. I also cannot believe people actually do this. What to do? I don't want to talk to him ever again."
relationship_advice,Has anyone stayed in a marriage after their partner had an affair and had a child with someone else?,"Additional information: My husband (38m) and I (38f) We have been married for 15 years. The last few years have been pretty much miserable but we basically stayed together for our children (this was not something that was discussed). I had no desire for sex at all and we easily went a year without sex with each other a few times. We slept in separate rooms and we also did not communicate other than to briefly talk about everyday household things. When we did talk it usually ended up with one of us being noticeably irritated with the other.   There was history of infidelity on both parts.  Most recently, he had started becoming friendly with a coworker (27f) and I suspected something was going on after looking at our phone records. However, I did not have the energy to question him about it knowing the condition of our relationship. Anyhow, a few months ago we ended up having a heart to heart and decided that we really wanted to work on our marriage. Immediately following this conversation he discloses that this girl is pregnant. After many long conversations we decided to keep working on our marriage and we have actually been closer than we have been in several years. We are also attending marriage counseling. My problem is, I feel humiliated to be in this situation and do not want any of my family or friends to find out. While I feel hurt by being put into this position, and I know I don’t deserve it, I can reasonably understand how we got here. What I find the hardest to come to terms with, is having other people know that my husband has a child outside our marriage. I am also concerned that I cannot find many examples similar to my situation, which makes me feel like I am the only person willing to stay in this situation."
relationship_advice,Is she pregnant?,"Not sure if this is the correct place to ask this but i’m desperate.

My girlfriend and I first had sex last week Thursday the 1/23/2020. It was her first time. 

To begin, i did not use a condom for the first like 4 minutes of it. I did not even feel any lingering orgasm or anything so I doubt i even had precum.

After about 4 minutes of no condom, i then put one on and proceeded to have sex and then ejaculated inside the condom outside of her.

Fast forward today 1/30/2020 my GF says she felt some abdominal paid, nausea, breast tenderness/slight pain, and a headache. I bought her a pregnancy test to urinate on and it said she is not pregnant.

Her period is in two weeks. And I’m paranoid about this. What do you guys think?"
relationship_advice,My (M27) roommate (M34) is constantly belittling me and it’s becoming toxic.,"I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t respectful to him but he is the kind of person who has to have things go his way, he’s very lazy, and god forbid he has to compromise on anything. It’s clear that he resents me. 

Lately I’ve been avoiding him as much as possible because he literally has to say something negative or condescending to me every time we are in the same room. Just now he kept going on about how he has so many more friends than me and that I’m antisocial and have no friends... not true, I just have no need to talk to him or tell him about my life outside of the house because I want nothing to do with him. 

It’s not really that I don’t have a spine. I could blow up at him, call him out on all of this, or even try to have a reasonable discussion but with a manchild like this, we can all imagine how that is going to go. We have had an awkward discussion many months ago but his toxic attitude has come back with a vengeance. Honestly I haven’t felt this bullied since middle school."

relationship_advice,Lying never stops....,My boyfriend of 2 years always lies to me. I always catch him. He lies like twice a week that I know of anyways. Not always big but most the time it’s big and hurtful. Can you trust somebody who keeps lying? I get so upset and cry and show him it tears me apart. I tell him that I lost my self esteem and dignity but he’ll do it again. He looks at other women in front of me and ignores me to stare it really hurts me deeply. What should I do?
relationship_advice,Need advice,"So my girlfriend of a year is bi and has had relationships with women in the past. She didn't tell me this untill late into our relationship.

Recently I went through her computer and saw she watches alot of 3some and lesbian porn. I've talked about it with her and she told me she hasn't and doesn't ever want to have a 3some, and I don't either because it makes me feel super uncomfortable and I don't like sharing.

relationship_advice,"Painting in the house in the winter is not generally a good idea, just don’t tell me.","My wife and I just had a small argument.  She came home after a late night hair cut all excited to start painting the house.  I told her plainly that painting the inside of the house in the winter (&lt;40 degrees) isn’t ideal.  And said frankly it is a bad idea. 

She got mad at me.  Very mad. We had a small argument as to how I should have approached the conversation.  She said I should have supported her decision to paint but asked her to do research.  (I have done that in the past and she gets mad when she didn’t think of x to research and blamed me for extra expenses and extra time it took to get the project done).  I know I can’t get it right but what I want to know is where do you draw the line in providing information?  Should I just let her do whatever?  How would you want someone to share the information with you?

relationship_advice,Bad response to a rough past,"I (25M) am lucky enough to never have had anything extremely traumatic growing up.

Wasn't the best. She's further upset that I'm 25 and don't really know how to handle these things, which I give her that, but I also don't really know how I would have learned without it happening. Can you help me understand the right way to approach this? When I heard it all I wanted to do was protect her and hold her and destroy anyone who would try to harm her, but it came across as more disbelief that anyone would ever hurt my girl. What is the right way to approach this, because she's worried that I'll never be receptive in the right way, and I want to be there for her when she's ready to share."

relationship_advice,Feel like I [M17] Don't get to hang out with girlfriend [F18] enough,"Her and I started dating about 5 months ago and starting off we saw each other for more than a couple of hours on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays because we both had mountain bike practice together. Its been about 3 months since the biking season ended and now we only get to see each other very briefly during school (no classes together) and because of homework and work her and I can never hang out during the week so we settle on hanging out during the weekends which are also full of homework and mixed schedules of work pretty much only letting us hang out early in the morning before work. Not to mention she has needy parents who hate last minute changes and require family time for themselves so i can't really hang out with her more than once a weekend. Whenever we hang out we always have a blast, but during the week I miss her and feel bad. (No way in hell ill break up with her so don't suggest that please). Is there anything i can do to either cope with it, or change things up to allow more time with her?

relationship_advice,I(22M) think my girlfriend’s(19F) father(71M) is emotionally abusive,"I’ve been with my girlfriend (I’ll call her “Jill”) for 6 months. Jill told me right from the beginning that she struggles with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and related atypical anorexia, as well as self-harm. None of this has affected our relationship, she’s very good at coping with BPD and while she has hundreds of scars, she hasn’t cut herself in almost a year now. She is getting the help she needs and I do everything I can to support her. I’ll get back to this later.

Jill’s dad (I’ll call him Doug) has a history of anger issues and lashing out at both Jill and her mom(55F). Off the top of my head, one day I brought her home 5 minutes late from when her father demanded she be home. She later told me that after she went inside, he proceeded to scream at her, call her names, and threaten to kick her out. The next day, he got mad that Jill’s mom was going to spend time with a friend, and threatened to kick both Jill and her mom out and told them that he’ll be living life while they’re homeless on the street (Jill’s mom quit work to help Jill recover from her eating disorder). Doug frequently calls Jill an ungrateful bitch. Until somewhat recently, he used to slap her ass when she walked by despite her telling him that it makes her uncomfortable. Jill’s mom (I’ll call her Phoebe) recently told her that Doug used to hit her in front of Jill when she was too young to remember, but hasn’t been physically abusive since. Doug expects a home cooked meal every night when he comes home from work. If Phoebe doesn’t want to make dinner and gets takeout, he throws a fit and berates her. One night, Phoebe wanted to go visit a friend, so she went out of her way to make a meal for Doug and save it in the fridge. Doug was so irritated that it wasn’t warm and ready for him, he threw it on the floor and made Jill clean it up.

Jill’s eating disorder has progressively gotten worse, and she began having suicidal thoughts. About a week and a half before Christmas, she tried to overdose. She had an intake at an eating disorder center after she took the overdose, and was rushed to the hospital when she passed out in the building. Her dad told a different story. He told his coworkers that he found her lying on the bathroom floor in her house, unconscious and foaming at the mouth. She was in a psych unit for a week and got to come home for Christmas. A few weeks ago, Jill was admitted to a residential eating disorder center with a very good reputation. She has been making amazing progress in her recovery, and she’s expressed that she thinks this is what she needed. I’m so proud of her, Jill is the strongest person I know and I call every day and visit as often as I can. Last time Doug visited, he was angry about something petty and told Jill that he will no longer come to visit her (he is all talk). Family therapy is a part of Jill’s treatment, but so far she has only had it with her mom by choice. 

Jill’s estimated discharge date is in two weeks, but she will likely be discharged sooner. She can now leave for 4 hours twice a week to do whatever she wants. I’m going to spend time with her outside of the center in a few days, for the first time in what feels like forever. She has told me that she feels her father is one of the biggest speed bumps in her recovery. She has very thick skin. Jill says that she can’t change him, she can only change herself. I wish I was that mature. 

I’m so afraid that when Jill gets discharged, she will relapse because of her father’s abusive nature. I told her that she should tell him exactly what he’s doing in family therapy, because the only thing Doug seems to care about is bad things happening to Jill. He loves her but hurts her so much at the same time. Part of me wants to sit down and talk to her about this when I see her in a few days, but another part of me just wants to make sure my favorite person has a good time. But I feel as if I cannot sit back and watch my girlfriend get emotionally abused by this sad excuse of a man any longer. I feel like I need to do something. I don’t know what to do. Please help."

We hit it off pretty good and we talked about when im coming down to visit family for Christmas. We hung out a lot and i asked her out a couple days before i had to fly back with the knowledge of me moving back with my mom when social services get it all sorted. When we started dating she told me she doesn’t really like long distance relationships but she would date me because we both thought i would be moving back within 3 months. After i got back i found out i wouldnt be able to live with my mom because of my sisters probation violations (shes 14). I havent told my girlfriend this yet but she was saying that she loved me (im homeschooled so we talk almost all day) and she would wait the 6 months for me to be 18 if she had to. The thing is is that i got drunk one night and called her talking about she would probably leave me if she had to wait the 6 months and she said probably bit i dont know if she was joking or not (we both have a really weird sense of humor) but a couple days ago she was telling me she would wait. How can i make her happy thought these next 6 months?

relationship_advice,Seems Uninterested but Asked Me Out?,"I made friends with a bartender nearby my place. I liked him a little bit, but was into this other guy that came to the bar like so much it was ridiculous. Got the bartender's Snapchat so I could ask when events were, chat a bit, and get the dirt on hot guys. I could tell he was maybe a little attracted to me but not too interested as I saw it. When I began Snapchatting with him though he'd start dropping hints that he liked me when I tried to discuss the one guy. He'd say, ""I'm too old for you!"" (The other guy is 7 years younger than me.) I tried changing the subject. Then it was ""maybe you can help me with (his project sometime)"" The next phase was ""So are you coming to see me tonight?"" He finally did ask me to get drinks but it was in a weird way, like he was afraid to actually come out directly and say it, it was hidden in a joke if that makes sense. He also kind of gazed across the room at me enough to notice. He's kind of a different duck, but I did enjoy talking to him at least. I would say for the record, he is probably ostensibly the most ""uninterested"" guy to ask me out. I wonder if he just did it bc I was convenient and had my snapchat? And why he kind of acted weird about it like that he expected me to pick up his hints while I was not really showing interest outside of being friends?"
relationship_advice,"Long distance boyfriend is acting... Well, distant. Need advice please. :')","(first off, yes I posted this exact thing on r/longdistance ,, I really just want some peace of mind lol)

Hey there, using my throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm just gonna jump straight into it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for the better part of a year now, we've been amazing about visiting each other (largest gap between visits so far has been 3 months) (which I'm pretty proud of because not only are we from two separate countries, also different Continents) having consistent communication and fun Skype dates, rarely arguing etc. 

The last couple of weeks have just felt,,, off??? He's been taking a course so he can eventually quit his current job, also planning a few things for his friend (won't specify because I'm trying to be as vague as possible for anonymity reasons)  and since he began he's just seemed really distant and weird. We have a dynamic where we're constantly poking fun at each other but lately that's all he does, to where I feel like I'm a bud more than anything and there's very little affectionate talk/flirting in between. I've been really worried about him leaving me (I have bad relationship anxiety to begin with, past abuse and all that, so this is why I'm making this post). He just seems off and I can't ignore it. I'm making myself sick over it. Not to mention he's going to a concert next month with some random girl he's been mutuals with on twitter for a while. (Like a year I think) haven't heard anything about her before this, and now she's suddenly liking all of his stuff, replying to him, being all friendly. 

Please don't attack me for being paranoid, I know I am. I've been trying really hard to not let my past experiences become an issue and let my fear of abandonment get the best of me but it's not an overnight process  I just need some peace of mind that this could all be chalked up to him being stressed please :')"
relationship_advice,Wife doesn’t support my positive life changes,"So this whole thing started two years ago, my then girlfriend was always haggling me about getting into the gym I was 350 pounds had a heavy drinking problem and was in the worst shape of my life so I finally gave in and got a gym membership with her, flash forward a year and I’ve lost 100 pounds and am feeling amazing about myself for once while she gave up within two months and I had decided then to set two goals for myself my short term goal compete in a local strongman competition coming up in a few months my long term goal to compete in worlds strongest man in the not so near future (yes very big aspirations I know) so I’ve been putting my nose to the grindstone and have been working as hard as possible four days a week sometimes up too three hours a night September comes around we get married and I’m feeling awesome about looking good for my wedding everything is fine until about a month later when she starts complaining about my new hobby, about how much food I’m eating, about how long I spend at the gym, about how I’m not spending enough time with her ( I set aside Wednesday evening and all weekend to do things with here) yet when it comes time to do things she never wants too, she always has plans with somebody else or doesn’t want to do the things I try to plan then complains about me “not being spontaneous anymore, it has culminated to the point now where she is demeaning my dreams, constantly calling me through my gym sessions “why are you still at the gym? You’re wasting your time, you’re never going to compete it’s not realistic” I’ve tried to talk to her and explain to her that I’ve finally found a healthy productive lifestyle and aspirations that I’m fully committed too, but she can’t seem to come to terms with that, when I do spend time with her all she wants to do is fight about all the tine I spend away from her, I don’t know if she’s jealous of what I’ve done with myself in the tine she wasnt committed or if she’s mad I’m not interested in participating in her hobby ( she wants me to quit training for strongman and come be part of her families racing team but I have no interest in taking that up)  I’m not sure what to do, reasoning with her gets me no where and I’m tired of constantly being brought down and demeaned by her for the things I want to do, sometimes I think she wants me to become a lazy drunk who’s completely dependent on her for my happiness, any advice on how to handle the situation?"
relationship_advice,I’ll be 500 miles away from my boyfriend for 3.5 months,"My boyfriend (M18) and I (F18) are very happily in a relationship right now with me at uni and him working, seeing each other at least once a week with only a distance of a 20 minute drive between us.

relationship_advice,Why did Ex unblocked me on Instagram after 2 years no contact (narcissistic ex),"He is a narcissist ex. He kicked me out numerous times until one day I didn’t come back. I had enough. Well he wanted to get rid of me so bad but once I was gone he began to stalk me , harass me at work, follow me, then one night he took it too far. I have exposed him by going to court and trying to get protection which I never got in the end . After one year exactly from the horrifying incident, I lost my mind and called him and began to even thank him and say I love and miss him... He told me to stay away and that I lied to the judge and he lives his new gf very much and that she actually respects him. He also told me to call back in 5 years because 1 year doesnt change people... then began to blame me for it being ruined and how insane sociopath I am..  then hung up . He had actually stayed in the phone for 20 mins. 


I was told I have Stockholm  syndrome . Anyways after that I realize how bad I had it with him and the trauma bond was dangerous, I have not contacted him since and want to keep no contact for life .. 
a month or two later I noticed he has unblocked me on Instagram ( I was not able to block him since he blocked me first before I could ) I checked after I noticed seeing him on my Venmo feed ( we were never Venmo friends before ..) 

I checked and he unblocked me on Instagram.  No communication at all still. I have yet to block him back I am just feeling like playing dead, I don’t want him to know i noticed or give any reaction. I’m torn if I should be scared (I was so scared when I left because he stalked me Heavy) but now he had a new gf so I believe he is not attempting anything"
relationship_advice,My(29) questions my relationship with my wife(27),"Hello, I finally decided to make a post here. It hits me everyday that I do not want to be with my wife. 
Here is the background.
I am asian so most of the decision came from my parents and it would be dishonor to not listen to them. 
So I never told my wife this. I was dating someone at the time I met my wife. I know I am a shit person. I was in a long distance relationship with someone from another country. As time progresses, I wanted someone local. Thats how I met my wife. I met her on an online dating site. 

In the beginning of the relationship I really enjoyed her company. We almost did everything together. I spend couple nights at her place and she spends a couple nights at my place. We met when I was 26ish, at the time we started dating I kept my long distance relationship. In the back of my mind I knew I want to married the long distance girl and just want company from the local girl. Couple months goes by I brought a ticket to see my long distance girl and broke it off with her. Then couples months later my local girl friend moved in with me. I was about 27, my parents kept rushing me to get married. So I did, I proposed to her. Even with the proposal, I didn't really felt likes he was the one. I only did it because my parents wanted me to. Then about 7-8 months goes by I met her side of the family.  I started disliking them. Then later found out her mom was sick and had cancer so her parents and my parents rush us to have a kid. We ended up having a beautiful daughter and I will never regret having her.  She is currently everything to me. If it was her, I would of had a divorce already. Over time her mom was cancer free from the treatments. Which I am happy about.

We then had our official wedding ceremony which confirms my dislike for her side of the family. At this moment I don't really talk to them, I would say hi at times when they video chat. 
Couple months after the wedding, our parents want us to have another child because they wanted a boy. It is really big in the asian community to have a boy.  Also, my wife and I felt like we want to have another one so our first kid has someone to play with. So as of right now my wife is pregnant with our second kid.

That's the background, as far as our sex life goes, we do not have one. I don't feel sexually attracted to her. I know the feelings are not there. I know I don't want to be with her, but since we have two kids I don't want them to grow up without both parents. I would do anything for my kids. I was going to wait until my kids are old enough then I can go through a divorce. As of right now, my wife controls a lot of my life. I can't really hang out with my friends for certain events. My days look like this. Work, home, sleep. When we are together we would be on our phones. I am a point where for holidays I don't really put any thoughts on what to get her. I just let her choose on what she wants. 

I want to thank this platform for letting me vent. I need to get that out of my system. Thank you for reading up to this point. Any advice will be helpful"
relationship_advice,Friends without benefits,"Ok so I was fwb with someone and it’s kind of just tapered off..sexually. Somewhat. We flirt and joke around and kiss and hug and cuddle hold hands etc. Only thing is we only have sex here and there now. I mean, we still do, but It’s not nearly as much as it was in the beginning. Although, we still hang out every day and kiss and stuff. Whats happening? lol I guess what I’m asking is why does he still hang around me and act sexual/ flirty even all the times that we don’t have sex? It doesn’t even phase him either. He doesn’t bring it up like he just wants to do it with me. He’s like perfectly content with just hanging out with me chillin cuddling watching movies or something"
relationship_advice,"I (21M) am worried about my boyfriend (23M) being bisexual, how do I cope with this?","First and foremost, I know that my behavior is EXTREMELY biphobic... I can’t help these feelings that I’m having about not being able to give him what a girl can, and it stresses me out.

I went to high school with this guy and didn’t really know him too well, he played 2 sports, took college classes, and was in student government. Really awesome guy, we just didn’t cross paths a lot as it was sort of frowned upon to be a guy playing sports talking to the only openly gay kid. He was never mean or rude to me, we just didn’t really talk.

He’s been in 2 relationships, both with women. From what he told me, they were both pretty awful to him. Cheating, manipulating, all of the tell signs of an abusive relationship. He has been single for about a year, and decided it was time to open up about being bisexual. He told me that he always thought I was cute in high school and was too scared to say hi, because well... high school.

As some backstory, I too have been in 2 relationships, however both with men. They were both awful to me. The first was very mentally/emotionally abusive with a single instance of physical abuse. He scared me away from dating for 4 years... I was a young teenager. The other guy had Tinder the entire time we dated and used me like a walking bank. Told his now ex-boyfriend (who he dated after me) that he never found me attractive but liked how generous I was.

Basically, I’ve never dated a bisexual man before. We’ve only been together about a month, and I really have no reason to feel the way I do. Maybe these feelings are normal, but I feel like they’re not. I feel awful about them and know they’re wrong, but I can’t shake them. He is so sweet to me and absurdly generous (which I don’t like very much) and once told me I make him feel “pretty gay”. He isn’t out to his parents or many of his old friends, but some of his new friends know. He’s met my parents, many of my friends, etc. and things are moving pretty fast, which might be a mistake. We’ve sort of slowed down a lot, which I think is for the best.

I have no reason to distrust him, and we’ve both been in pretty bad relationships. I just don’t know what to do.

TLDR:

I feel biphobic and have not been in a healthy relationship so I have distrust for no reason."

relationship_advice,Honesty about cheating,"Does it matter that your significant other admits to cheating? 

Long story short: 
I (M 33) have dating this lovely girl (27) for about 6 years. We were amazing for the majority of it, then our intimacy reduced from 2-3 weekly to maybe ~1 monthly. 3 months ago, we took a break from each other for about month until we mended things and for me, things were even more amazing; like 'arranging plans to fly to where her dad lives and ask for her hand in marriage' type amazing.
She just recently breaks down to me that during our break, she slept with somebody. 
Even though we were on a break (her idea) it still shoots daggers to my heart. And it's difficult to process it all.
I appreciate that she was honest about it. But I don't know how to feel.
Should I disregard because of the break?  Even though it still hurts like it wasn't a break?
Any advice helps. Thank you."
relationship_advice,I (21M) got into an argument with my girlfriend (22F) and I do not know how to validate her feelings because I do not understand them,"All,

My gf and I got into an argument today because I tried a drug (MDMA) and she hates drugs. Now, as far as I knew, she hates addictive drugs for the obvious reasons and I wouldn’t argue that for a second, they are dangerous. However, I did this twice while we were apart just to experiment and experience it. I enjoyed it, but I haven’t tried it since and have no plans of trying it again in the near future. I also backed that up by mentioning how the two times I tried that I was clubbing and how I was been clubbing several times since then and haven’t partaken even when it’s available.

Basically she got upset and I was trying to understand her rational. I calmly asked her to tell me more about how she was feeling and what bothered her about my behavior. The only time I got defensive was when I said it wasn’t a habit, just experimentation. After a few minutes of this she said that she is even more upset that I didn’t validate her feelings, that she cannot be with a drug user, and then she stormed out.

I’m left dumbfounded. I thought I handled the situation well - remained calm, didn’t get defensive (even though I did feel attacked), and tried to understand what was going on. RA, what should I have done different and what do I do know.

Follow up here, this kind of thing happens often when we get in an argument and she is angry with something I did. I try to be the best I can, but two things happen often. 1) it is very hard for me to validate her being upset with me because I genuinely do not have bad intentions. 2) I do not understand so I can’t validate her because I don’t know what’s going on. Not to be self-pitiful, but often times when an argument begins I feel defeated because I know no matter what my response or however much I try to validate (even if I don’t understand or agree) she seems to get more upset by what I say. I need to nip this in the butt because it is unhealthy and making me crazy. I’m hoping some of you with more experience can please help me and teach me to see past my own ego."
relationship_advice,When does it go away?,"I have no.idea where to post this, so I hope this is the right place. I don't have many people to reach out to living in a city by myself and working full time, so this is the closest I have to reaching out right now.

Ok, so everything has come to make sense since my break up. One of my very few friends got sick of me being miserable at my break up. I was so miserable because I had my ex on a pedestal, thinking he was different and that he got away.... Until my close mate decided enough was enough and sent me screenshot of my ex's Facebook saying if he can move on, so can I. He had uploaded photos of him and his new girl (who he told me the entire time we were together were just friends and I encouraged him to catch up with her whenever he brought her up in conversarion).

Now, I am just angry. I am angry at him for dumping me after my birthday giving me so many different lies and excuses he gave me. The lies that he never would betray my trust, that he isn't the type to jump straight to another girl because of his OCD and mental health.

And mostly, I am angry at myself for falling for another toxic relationship where there was a 3rd in the relationship involved. How I keep missing the red flags and letting myself get into these situations so many times with different men. I am tired crying at being alone and hard done by and feeling like there is something wrong with me. 

It has been 3 months since the break up and I feel so many bought of anger from wanting to make him hurt as much as I am. But also that wierd feeling of happiness and closure that I.finally have the real answer as to why he broke up with me.

When does that anger stop? What can I do to speed up the healing? 

This was only my 3rd serious relationship and he was a wonderful boyfriend only to stab me in the back like the others. I know I will be single for a very long time after this because I can't even bring myself to rebound like before. I don't even know where my head is at from this."

relationship_advice,If it’s not a fuck yes then it’s a no?,"Talked to this guy in the fall for 5 months. We were exclusive, he was recently out of a long term relationship and it ended up not working out due to him feeling like there was still baggage from his previous relationship (his ex still trying to be in his life). He ended up telling her to go away and reached out to me two months after splitting claiming he sees a future with me after college (were both seniors), and he knows he messed up yada yada. I decided to give him another chance cause he is a genuinely sweet guy. Things were going great for a month but we ended up fighting a lot last week over really dumb things. I especially was difficult and acted like a complete dumbo which I have apologized profusely for. Everything seemed fine for a couple days and then he started acting distant. I asked him what was wrong and he came over to talk and said he’s confused about what he wants because the constant arguing drains him (which really is out of the norm for us), and he’s scared about having to move after we graduate/ having to deal with that down the line. I really really do like him and see a future with him but I’m tired of this half in and half out BS. I do believe he cares about me and is scared to commit but he’s acting like being official is a friggin marriage proposal. We already act like we are together, are exclusive, all our friends know..... so why not? I’ve tried really hard to be patient and understanding but am I letting him walk all over me at this point? We’re supposed to talk tomorrow about things but I’m not so sure I want to be with someone who’s been so unsure about me. Advice?"
relationship_advice,My(f21) Mom (f57) is having a mental breakdown again and refuses to get help again and my dad thinks i’m a jerk for telling her she needs it,"My mom has tried to commit suicide multiple times. The first time was when she was pregnant with my eldest brother. My dad found her passed out after taking a bottle of motrin, She thought that would do it apparently. My dad got her to go to therapy back in the 90s and even got some anti depressants. Those didn’t last long since my grandmother talked her out of it. My family has a history of the women on my moms side having BPD. I have it. My mom, grandmother, and great grandmother had it who the latter actually committed suicided and succeeded well before my mom was born. My mom has had multiple points where she has tried or threatened to self harm again and again and always refuses help. It triggers her to even suggest she needs it. This past two months have been extremely hard on me. She always picks someone to take her grief out on and it has been me. For example, she bought oranges four weeks ago and I found then molded over yesterday. I threw them out thought nothing of it. Cue an hour later she rushes me in the living room yelling at me about how I threw out her dinner. That I’m targeting her and destroying her life. Because I threw out rotten food? My dad tried to intervene but that just made it worse. She claimed we were ganging up on her. I told her to stop playing these games and to go to a f*cking therapist. I then went to my room and slammed the door (I know very teenage). She went to her room crying and told my dad she is thinking about ending it again. He told me today that I should never had said anything to her and that this wasn’t my place. I disagree but tbh i’m probably in too deep to see clearly. Help me. What can I do?"

relationship_advice,"Ex broke up with me yesterday, he's coming over tonight to talk - last chance?","Hi guys,

My ex broke up with me yesterday. He left ohr apartment and went to sleep at a friend's place. I'm a mess and I don't understand anything. He wanted to come by tomorrow to talk and to sort out all of our shared things.

We texted for a bit today and he agreed he'd come over tonight already instead of tomorrow 11am.

I asked him to, but now I'm thinking he could have insisted on tomorrow, his original suggestion. He know a part of him still loves me and he obviously cares that I'm not doing okay. We said we'd order food and talk. He'll bring some confectionery and drinks.

I don't know, is this maybe a sign he might still be open to discuss everything?
I feel like if he just wanted to get that break, he would have stuck with his original plan to come by tomorrow.

What do you guys think? Is this a tiny light at the end of the tunnel?"
relationship_advice,How to get over a girl I asked out but had to cut contact off with?,"I asked a girl out from work that I see everyday. She told me she has a boyfriend. That's cool so I backed off. But she wanted to be friends, so I reciprocated. This was stupid of me because I just developed feelings for her and wanted to ask her out more.

At this point I decided to tell her I can't be friends with her. She has the right to not to reject my date offer, just as I have a right not to accept her friendship.

In that sense, everything is fine.

She is clearly pissed off that I told her we didn't want to be friends. She won't even look me in the eye. We cross paths frequently and she just puts a stern look on and looks straight ahead, purposely making sure not to look at me. Which is totally OK - she doesn't owe me anything.

But everyday I almost break in and apologize to her and tell her we can still be friends just so I can talk to her again. The thing I hate the most is knowing that I hurt her.

Is there anything else other than rely on the tincture of time to get over this? Any way to better deal with the situation?"
relationship_advice,My (30M) girlfriend (30F) and I had ecstasy. I disclosed the trauma experienced as a soldier. She's questioned if I'm violent and has cut me off from her friends,"I love my girlfriend, she's incredibly smart and a loving woman. We've been dating for less than a year but I felt we shared the same values and a future. The one point we did disagree on was recreational drug use which she's used on occasion. 

She's from a very privileged family, but escaped her lawless home country.  As a girl, she was the victim of a bombing and has a history of exposure to country falling into chaos.

Over NYE she suggested I try a small dose of MDMA / ecstasy for the first time.   

It's the closest thing I could describe it as is a spiritual experience. I confessed I loved her and felt bliss, except surprisingly retreating during the fireworks at 9pm. She knows I served, but the conversation never went far as she would blunty ask if I killed people.

This week we had a large party to celebrate a national holiday (we're not American). She highlighted it's use in PTSD therapy, and I agreed to have another dosage of MDMA. The article she shared noted that PTSD patients have made breakthroughs through MDMA.  

Whilst under the influence I disclosed that as a soldier I had taken the lives of others. My girlfriend and a close female friend of hers were unaffected by the dose and were stunned / embarrassed. I don't recall what I said, but she said I confessed to killing women and children.   

My girlfriend took me aside, let me share my truth and we partied until sunset.   

The days following she's asked me again, how many women and children I’ve killed.  

I responded, stating I don't know. We were in the middle of a Netflix comedy and felt her opening line was abrupt. I did try to explain the 'don't know' but inelegantly. At the time I didn't recall the specifics of my confession, merely knowing I revealed too much.  

I don't know because we would only return fire when engaged. Up to 16 soldiers would be returning fire. Most of these engagements were at roughly 300meters / 300 feet. It's impossible to know the enemy shooting at me is a woman, child, or man until after. It's impossible to know if I killed them, or simply returned fired in their direction. I would go into autopilot, return fire, reload, clear any rifle jams. It's like when one drives to work and can't recall driving.  

Most of the combatants would be local veterans but kids, widows and the mentally handicapped were used as suicide bombers. 

I've tried not to think about this in the decade since. After an injury I discharged and 12 weeks later I enrolled in engineering school. I've worked corporate internationally. I have a healthy social life, I founded a company across three countries. I don't know why, on drugs I've unburied this all.  

Since this weekend I’ve noted she stopped inviting me to social events and had withdrawn.  

I tried to arrange a call her to discuss this and we had the following [conversation](https://imgur.com/a/OLFxDtO).  

She questioned if she can have a family with me. She suggested I was a threat to her safety. This is a legitimate response given the confession but I felt abandoned.  Days before she said she wanted to have a family together. Given her history I expected her to appreciate not everywhere is safe, and why I volunteered to serve.

My Doctor who is also a veteran advised not to use MDMA at all without a trained professional. He expressed it is very common for traumatic memories to rise up for processing during an MDMA experience. It is one of the primary known effects of the substance. I've scheduled in a counselor to get the appropriate treatment.

Was my decision too sensitive? 

Should I respond to her and express the background or leave her be?  

Pardon my English, I'm not a native speaker."
relationship_advice,My (22M) girlfriend (22F) got upset I forgot our year and a half anniversary. Then told me that I never do anything sweet for her. Should I tell her why?,"So I have been dating my girlfriend for about two years, but officially for a year and a half now. Today was our year and a half anniversary and I totally forgot. I feel terrible because it was important to her (although I personally didn't think too much of it myself). I wish I had said something or visited her to surprise her. 

This caused her to become upset with me, which I understand and is completely valid. She continued on to tell me that she feels like I don't do anything sweet for her anymore. She said she is tired of the ""same old, same old"". I feel guilty because she is partially right, although I am sweet to her on a daily basis and try to do small gestures regularly , I haven't taken her out on a date or similar in some time. 

The three main reasons are:

* While we are currently in school right now our schedules do not line up very well, making it difficult.
* Also due to school I work only weekends and make less money, so I can't afford dates as often due to lack of money. She also currently makes little to no money so I have been paying for our eating out when we hangout, as well as gas to visit her (25km away, 3x a week avg.). Not that I mind this
* The main reason, however, is that I have been depressed as hell.   

I spend most of my time on reddit or youtube, despite being in school and not even wanting to spend my time like that or enjoying it. Last semester I skipped the majority of my classes each week to spend time lying in bed on my phone. I have no motivation or care for anything, family, friends, myself or her, as much as it pains me to admit. Lately I have been trying to stop this behavior but I have found it so hard and draining. I have been going to every class (with only 3 exceptions due to family emergency or really depressed days), spending more time with family, friends (the few I do have) and my girlfriend. I am not feeling better but I hope that going through the motions will make me feel better. Trying to do this stuff has left me feeling so tired and still empty, as a result I haven't even thought about planning a date for us at all, I am just trying to get through the days.

The problem that I am having now is if i tell her the scope of my depression. She knows I have been down for a little bit but I don't tell her exactly what is happening. She herself suffers from depression and has been going through a really rough bout of it right now. I try to cheer her up and keep her hopeful as best I can, and as a result I don't want to burden her with my issues more than I do (not saying I am a burden). For example, all of the classes I skipped last semester (which was probably over 40% of all classes and labs), I told her I went to all of them. I felt wrong telling her how I was wasting days away on nothing. Then it got to so many classes I felt wrong for hiding it from her and didn't want her to be upset with me because of it. I still passed my classes (thank god lmao) and so she never had a reason to doubt it. On days where I feel my worst I sometimes tell her,but often I try to ignore it, or she will come to me with her issues and I will put mine aside to help her. 

The other thing is that she often gets really cold when we have an argument. We were supposed to see each other tomorrow and she said not to bother. She said she doesn't want to do Valentines day (which I actually planned for) and she said she wants space. Then she asked me if I'm happy with us. I said yes and asked her the same, to which she said hesitantly that she didn't know.

SO I don't know if I should tell her because:

* I don't want her to worry about me or be upset with me (kinda foolish ik)
* I don't want her to feel guilty for being upset because it is valid
* I don't want to bring it up if I don't think she'll be happy with me regardless, I'd rather save her the time and disappointment

Right now I just feel lost, I don't know what to do and I don't feel like anyone has given me solid advice yet. I love her and I just want the best for us. If anything I want to know the best way to approach the situation, without making her feel guilty and doing it in a way that she can understand (as I am bad at explaining my feelings). I also don't want to use depression as an excuse for my arguably poor behavior as she does deserve better, so I wanted an unbiased opinion on myself as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Forgot my 1.5yr anniversary (important to her). Issue of lack of planed dates came up. Don't know if I should tell her it is due to the severity of my depression or if it just an excuse I use for myself."
relationship_advice,"How do i get my boyfriend to like, leave me alone?","i really love him but he is just so damn clingy. he literally wants to talk all day, and if i leave our discord call while we are gaming and wanna be alone and listen to youtube, or go to sleep without saying goodnight, he like freaks out. he sends me texts saying that he’s sorry he fucked up and asks why i’m mad at him, he starts crying, and when i talk again (this is like, a hour later. not like i’m ghosting him for 4 weeks) he says he’ll do better and that he’s sorry for hurting my feels... like dude you did literally nothing wrong, i just want to be alone sometimes. i would want to be alone sometimes no matter who it is. sometimes you just need personal time to recharge ya know? i just don’t wanna hurt his feelings, what would be a good way to tell him this without doing that?"
relationship_advice,Am I(21F) over-exaggerating how badly my mom’s(50F) reaction to me coming out was?,"When I was around 15 years old, my mom searched my phone and found very flirtatious text messages between me and a girl from school that I was dating. She immediately asked me if I was a lesbian and if I was dating this random girl. I couldn’t speak, just stammered and started to tear up. We were sitting on a couch, with my head in her lap at the time. After I calmed down a little, I told her that I was dating this person, and she was a girl. Next thing I know, she slapped me. I remember freezing, resuming my panicking, and just saying “You hit me” while my mom kept talking, I don’t remember what. Eventually, she calmed down and told me it was an accident. It is common for her to flail her arms when she gets scared or shocked, and because of our positioning, her arms were already close to my face. 

Now, I am 21 and I have not gotten over this incident, and we have not talked about this since it happened. I have only told this story to one person- my best friend. I just recently realized that I have not come out to anyone else close to me. I have tried to ignore that this happened until a recently.

A month ago, my younger brother- who is a freshmen in high school- started to be bullied because of a rumor that he was gay. My mom doesn’t think he is gay, and was just started by some random kid. When I was told about this from my mom, I decided that the next time I went home I was going to talk with her about how she reacts to people coming out to her can be very impactful, especially to your child. I was very anxious, and psyched myself up before talking with her. I essentially told her that if my brother were to come out to her, she needs to react positively, and remind him that she loves him. I felt like I was protecting my brother from an upsetting experience and would give him confidence to be out to more people than myself. My mom reacted by cutting me off half way through my prepared speech by laughing, and saying “I probably shouldn’t hit him, huh?” 

I was speechless, I saw this incident as incredibly distressing and I thought it had dramatically changed how I interacted with people. And she was laughing about it. Based on her reaction, I am starting to reevaluate the incident.

When I was in middle school, around 12 years old, I was transferred to a new school because I was being bullied. I know that my psychologist wrote to the superintendent of my school saying that my life was in danger, as I was suicidal. I know that the kids at school weren’t acting kind towards me, however, I cannot remember the bullying, or even individual incidents of bullying. I also know that the group of kids that I accused of bullying me denied everything, saying that I was making everything up. I have questioned if I was over-exaggerating about the bullying since it has happened. I am beginning to question if I am over-exaggerating about how bad my coming out actually was. If my coming out was meet with such a negative reaction, why would my mom react to my coming out with laughter. She has never been cruel, malicious, or abusive to me or any of my siblings before, so if my coming out was so negative, why is she reacting like this. 

I don’t know how to approach this. I cannot tell if I am making all this up or exaggerating how this happened, and I don’t have a lot of people to talk to about this, so I am turning to Reddit because it’s cheaper than a therapist. Am I over-exaggerating? How should I approach this if I am?"
relationship_advice,Do I need to end things with my(18f) boyfriend(19m)?,"{Just a heads up, I honestly don’t know how to format this and I’m rambling at like 11:45 at night}

So to I guess put things on paper, I am having doubts in my relationship. I feel as though I, further down the line, might have to keep on doing what im already doing to keep things going. 

What has been going, is that I feel as though my boyfriend is really clingy, is kinda annoying, and kinda always needs motivation. To clarify, he always wants to be around me, wants to hug, and wants to kiss. I’ll probably sound kinda weird when I say this but there are times where I don’t feel like being affectionate. In better words, I’m kinda like a cat when it comes down to affection. As far as annoying goes...yeah. I got nothing right now so ignore that. For needing motivation, I helped him get the same job as me, I have to motivate him to work out even though he says he wants to lose weight, and I have to motivate him to get a new job since we both quit the other job. I feel as though if I bring this up to him, actually every time I bring this up to him, he kinda gets sad/depressed and always asks if hes a bad boyfriend. And there are honestly times where I want to say yes so that he’ll get it through his skull that he needs to get his shit together. 

Am I just an nit picky person?

Am I the problem?  I kinda feel like I am. Maybe I am. Idk. I can’t really decide how I feel right now. 

My main question is “Do I want to deal with this for the rest of the year? The rest of my life if we even make it that far?”"
relationship_advice,My (30/M) girlfriend’s (28/F) former fuck buddy is coming in to town for a week. And staying with her.,"I’ve been dating someone for 6 months now, and for the most part it’s been going well. We like each another a lot, and have been meeting up 2-3 times a week since we met. I should note she’s not technically my “girlfriend”, since she claims she’s hesitant about labels, though we did decide to be exclusive early on. The labeling has bothered me at times, other times not as much. Her parents know of me as “Jeremy, the kind of boyfriend”. Fine. 

The real issue is about two months ago she admitted to me she cheated on her prior boyfriend, with multiple people, although according to her he “started it”. One of the people she cheated with was someone who was supposed to just be her platonic roommate, but they couldn’t keep their hands off each other and they hooked up a week before they even moved in together. All red flags.

An affair ensued, he eventually moved out of the country, they had a long distance relationship, and it quickly fell apart. They are however still friends, and I recently found out (by accident), that she’s been planning to go to Canada to visit him. That plan slightly changed, and he’s now coming HERE to stay with her for a week. Again, I found this out by total accident. Obviously I’m very uneasy about this situation, though I’ve yet to have a real conversation with her about it. She’ll probably say they’re “just friends” now and that I have nothing to worry about, but believing that will take a super human amount of trust on my part.

My question is: do I confront her about the dubiousness of this situation, possibly breaking up with her, or rely on blind trust and choose to believe her? I feel like no matter how I vent my concerns the die is cast and he’s going to be here no matter what. I just don’t know how I should deal with that reality.

TL;DR: the person I’m dating is shacking up with a guy she cheated ON her last boyfriend with. Is this beyond the pale and grounds for a breakup, or the ultimate test in trust?"
relationship_advice,Anyone else frustrated w not looking like the porn starts / girls / ig models you know your bf looks at,"I have a good relationship w my bf- we have been dating 6 y and have talked about getting married etc. However .... I hate when I see the type of models / porn he uses to ... relieve his needs ? They don’t look like me .... they’re a lot thinner, fitter (6 pack type deal). It’s silly because we connect so well as people and he approached me after meeting me for only a few minutes (so I have , at least, some physical features he likes). It just kills me a little .... esp since one-of the ig models is a friend of a friend from his hometown. I look at these girls and feel ugly ... how can I not"
relationship_advice,Am I (18M) unreasonable to get angry over my girlfriend (18F) demanding that I block one of my friends (17F)?,"Pretty much the title I suppose, but it goes back a bit. This past Summer I attended where I had to be away from my Girlfriend for a few weeks. Ever since this, she has had major trust issues with me, especially with anyone from the program.

I made some good friends over the summer, but she doesn't want me talking to any of them, and gets incredibly angry when I do. But there is this one girl in particular that she hates, even though I never did anything out of bounds (in my opinion) with her. I hung out with her in a group setting with our friends over the summer, but my GF thought that was too far, so I refrained from major interaction since then.

She still holds everything from the Summer against me. I have several classes this year with that particular girl this year, which drives my GF crazy. She saw that I had a Snap from her, which was only about calculus since she missed a day. This lead to my GF throwing a fit and demanding that I block her, or that she would break up with me. 

I resisted at first, but eventually gave in. She's got major jealousy issues, and I don't want to upset her too much, so I gave in. It still really upsets me though. I don't like being told what to do, especially when I haven't done anything truly wrong in my opinion. Am I wrong for being mad? Am I wrong for not wanting to block her?

TLDR: My GF made me block one of my (girl) friends for asking a question about our class, I didn't want to and got upset but gave in. Am I wrong?"
relationship_advice,"She said she feels bad for me, what does this mean?","What does it mean? Like I know its pity. But is that exactly a bad thing? Is that empathy?

relationship_advice,My Friend (17M) thinks his best friend (17M) is trying to get with his girlfriend (17F),"Alrighty, so my close friend who we'll call Bret has been coming to me about this issue for the past few days. Bret is dating this girl Carrie, and they have been dating for about five-ish months now. It's been a rocky road for them both, but overall they are doing ok. Bret's best friend and roommate is Gary.  We all go to a boarding high school. 

All of us are in the same friend ground, and recently, Gary has been talking to Carrie pretty frequently and they have been getting pretty close. Carrie and Gary talk to each other more than Bret and Carrie do (from Bret's perspective). Gary did have feelings for Carrie at one point, before Bret and her started dating, and has not pursued anything further. Bret is obsessed with the idea that Gary is trying to get with Carrie, and keeps coming back to the few same points:

\- Gary had feelings for her

\- Gary likes someone and that person likes him back but they haven't begun a relationship

\- Gary has never opened up about his mental health to anyone other than Carrie

\- Bret's therapist (first time was today) mentioned that she would feel the same way in that situation, and that he is being totally reasonable.

Bret knows that Carrie has no feelings for Gary and will not try anything, but he is still bothered by the idea of them spending so much time together and talking too much. I've talked with all three of them indivualdually and tried to get them all to talk. Bret and Gary talked last night and Bret said he felt much better and was just being irrational about it, but now after his therapists comment, he's back to obsessing over it. He's not convinced that Gary is lying to him and trying to cover up the situation. 

Also important background, Gary and Bret have been friends for four years now, and Carrie is new this school year. 

Anyways, I'm not sure what to do or how to help them? How to I help this situation, what advice can I give? 

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I'm 99.9% sure Gary is not trying to get with Carrie and that Bret just has some underlying issues that are making this seem bigger than it is."
relationship_advice,How do you get over anxiety after traumatic past relationships and other things,"Hello everyone, yes this is a new account but I decided to make a separate account for posts that I want to be anonymous, not for just this subreddit but for just in general instead of making a throwaway account for everything. Hopefully that makes sense!


This is kind of a two part question, and I’m going to try to make it short and to the point. The first part to it is pretty self explanatory from the title. I am 27F, and I identify as demisexual. I have not dated anyone since 2013, in which I ended a very toxic relationship that included lots of gaslighting, cheating, etc. I’ve gone on a few dates, and talked to people on dating apps, but anxiety has usually led me to cancel dates and just ghost someone pretty much immediately. 

This past November I met someone and somehow managed to go on several dates and not ghost them, and we have been talking ever since. The beginning of this month we became “official” and while I really like him (30M) I still find myself with just so much anxiety and overwhelm at times that I don’t know how to deal with it. I can’t even really articulate WHAT is making me anxious besides just trauma from past relationships. I’ve communicated this and he has been super understanding and kind, but has anyone else experienced this/does anyone have advice for dealing with anxiety over relationships?

My second question has to do with something he told me and how best to support him. A few months ago when we were talking about what we wanted and where we saw this going, he told me that his past relationship had lasted almost ten years and had ended in the beginning of 2019 when she passed away really suddenly. I honestly just can’t relate to this because I had one bad relationship and didn’t date for like 7 years, and it hasn’t even been a full year of her passing but I also don’t want to all him how to feel or cope or just back out because I think it might not work out, but I also am not sure what to do with this information besides just keep doing what we’re doing and taking things super slowly. So has anyone else experienced something similar to this before/how do you support an SO that has lost someone before you?


That was really rambly, if anyone read all of this I’m honestly amazed. 

TL;DR how do you deal with anxiety over dating after 7 years of being single, and how do you support a new SO who lost a loved one before you? 

TIA!"
relationship_advice,She (17f) stalked my (17m) twitter and found out that I called another girl hot," 

Few  months ago, I came across a tweet that insulted the looks of the daughter of one of the famous guys in my country. I replied to that  tweet ""The girl's hot"". But if you'd seen the girl you'd decide she was objectively good looking at an instant. I love my girlfriend, no other female is attractive to my eyes. And even in a future where we break up none other will be attractive to my eyes. Attractive and looking good are two separate things. So, she got jealous and sent me pictures of guys she finds hot.  The guys were literally top tier male models, and she sent me a picture  of a guy that does some Instagram modelling and called him ""the most  handsome kid in our country"".

Now,  I've done modeling in the past and still get offers, and in real life  standards you could say I'm an attractive guy who had zero problems with his looks. I get asked once in a while if I do modelling,  and when I say no they tell me I should think about it. So I don't really have any problems with my looks, and her sending those pictures of guys she finds hot didn't really bother me or made me feel insecure. If she had any chance with them, I could have been disturbed about it. But those were extremely good looking people.

 After she sent me those pics  I told her if she wants me to send her a picture of a girl that's really hot, she said yes. In response I sent her her own picture. And she asked me ""okay, and do you want me to  send you pictures of a guy I really find hot?"" I said sure, you can send me the pictures. And she kept sending me pictures of another guys. I  wasn't really disturbed or jealous, but my heart hurt a little. Not  because of she found those guys ""hot"", that would be something I'd be  disturbed about in the past. But I don't know why, it just hurt man.  What should I do? I love her a lot, am I just pretending like I'm not  seeing the red flags? Or would you have done the same she's done? She  has no problems with her looks, she doesn't look bad and has no  insecurities about it. But me calling another girl hot offended her I  guess. And I figured I'd ask her ""if one of these guys were to hit on you, would you leave me and go to them?"", she said ""yes I'd go to them instantly they are hot as fuck"". But I know for a fact she did it to get back at me. I love her. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there anything I should do? I am currently happy with our situation.
2. Could what she did be justified? She acted out of jealousy I guess. I love her. 
3. Did I act like an asshole in any part of this situation?
4. If you read the P/S, do you guys think I have the secret gay? 

&amp;#x200B;

P/S:  I don't know if I should include this but here we go, I have a hidden picture album in my phone. This album consists of male models like Francisco Lachowski, David Gandy, Jordan Barrett, Sean O'Pry, Jon  Kortajarena, Atesh Salih, Lucky Blue Smith, Matt Bomer, Jeremy Meeks.  Whenever I get bored, I type in the password and get access to the  album, and I look at their pictures while being amazed at how aesthetic they are. Might this be why I had no problem by looking at the pictures  of hot guys she sent me?"
relationship_advice,"Told my partner I didn’t think I could be a Christian like they wanted, they said that this wasn’t going to stop them from trying to convert me. Where do I go from here?","Hi all, I’m Avery (14NB) and Ive been dating my partner (14, N/A gender) for about half a new year now. For the sake of simplicity, let’s called them Alex. Alex is a Christian (they’re not a religious zealot or anything dw) and I go with them to their youth group on Fridays. At this point I’ve been going with them to youth group for about a year. The thing is, the main reason why I was invited to go with them in the first place was because Alex is trying to convert me to Christianity. The reason why they’re trying to in the first place is because in Christianity (not Catholic btw), non-Christians automatically go to hell and Alex doesn’t want that for me, hence the attempting conversion to their religion. Though, after getting more information and thinking it over, I realized that I didn’t want to become a Christian as I had a lack of belief. Realizing how much this would hurt Alex, for a while I just didn’t say anything. Though soon enough I realized I had to address this, so despite being extremely anxious this Thursday I confronted them and told Alex how I “didn’t think I could be a Christian like they wanted”. Alex just stared at me for a moment, and I saw their eyes start to water. Fewer moments could make me feel as horrible as that. Afterwards, instead of respecting my decision or breaking up with me like I thought they would, Alex asked me why specifically I couldn’t follow Christianity, and basically went on a rant about how much God loves us, how non-Christians are denying Jesus’s help, etc. They made this one analogy about how everyone is drowning, and Jesus is someone with a ton of boats and resources. There are some people (Christians) who are like “fucking finally, let’s get out of the water” while others (non-christians)  They even said, “We [christians] can’t just let people not accept help. We aren’t gonna be like ‘oh well, it’s fine for different people to have different opinions-‘ no, we’re going to save them.” The entire time during their rant, I just didn’t say anything, even though I knew I should’ve stood up for myself.
After that conversation I didn’t really know what to do. Originally I set out to set some boundaries, but clearly that didn’t work? I just talked to one of my good friends and they said that this is a really toxic situation as no person should force something onto someone that doesn’t want it. My current plan is to confront Alex tomorrow and be more direct, but does anyone have any advice on how to do that better than I did? It’s clear I was way too passive as Alex didn’t get the message. What things should I say that address the problem directly and set boundaries nice and clear?

TL;DR, Partner is trying to covert me to their religion, I didn’t want to and confronted them about trying to pressure me into it. They didn’t get the message, and I’m going to try again tomorrow. Advice on what to say and to be more direct and firm?"

Problem is we are both incredibly shy and the farthest we’ve made it is cuddling (not even kisses). In the next couple days he wants to come here and show me the Star Wars movies  because I’m uncultured swine and have never seen them. Which makes me incredibly happy because we went on our first date today and so I’m glad he enjoyed it and is already wanting to make a prolonged date spread over a couple days to marathon these movies. 

He and I agreed to take things incredibly slow as we both got out of rough relationships recently. But I found out today that he’s been talking to his mother about me!! Usually he only involves her in his social life if the people are important to him. He even told her about my disorder which made me want to cry cause it means he’s not ashamed or fearful to date a crazy girl. Which warmed my little heart :3 

I really really want to push the touch boundary just a tiny bit more but I’m literally getting anxious just typing this. Ugh please help... should I just play it cool like we normally do but kiss him on the cheek when he leaves??? I am definitely gunna be laying in his lap but goodness he gives me the same fluttery feelings he did back in high school when I was just his project partner for class.

relationship_advice,I need help dealing with my emotionally disturbed ex boyfriend.,"Long story short, we were together for almost 6 years. He always had crippling anxiety, depression, a porn addiction and had a bad addiction to weed, which I never experienced before. (I always assumed it was safe because nobody I knew had issues with it, ever). 

I reached my breaking point and wound up leaving him for someone else. (He didn’t learn this until much later, he just assumed I was fed up),

I made the stupid mistake of trying to be friendly, and cordial. The breakup was surprisingly easy and we went our separate ways without anger. 

This is where is turns dark. 

Apparently he started drinking quite a bit. He totaled our old car while on a date 3 or 4 months post breakup. he hit a parked car and fled the scene because he was drunk. He drove the car into an alley and the next day had it towed and sold it for parts. 

He got a new car but drove home drunk and got a flat. He didn’t notice and actually drove home on the rims. On the freeway in Los Angeles. 

He blacked out outside of a bar and was dropped off at the park by his house because he couldn’t remember his address and a friendly bar patron was trying to help him out. 

He would periodically send me stupid articles or music and I just wouldn’t respond because I’m busy and have my own life.  He took huge offense to it twice and told me that I was awful and ask me to never talk to him again. He wrote these lengthy incoherent texts about how awful I am as a friend and that I’m full of shit when I promised I would always be there for him. 

5-6 months later he would see a therapist and reach out and apologize and I would respond like a stupid idiot. 

We made up again and he told me he fell in love with some married girl at work and he sent me the texts he sent her - it was awful. She seemed scared and he seemed like he was crazy and kept saying he loved her over and over again. She just kept saying “I don’t understand how you feel mislead, I’m married, we were just friends”

It really freaked me out but I brushed it off. He wound up quitting that job, the 4th one since we broke up 5 years ago. It was always someone else’s fault. 

Now, He keeps trying to hang out and I keep making excuses to not meet up for a drink. I don’t want to see him. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like if I tell him honestly that I just can’t be friends with him, he will either try to hurt himself or he will hurt me. I think he’s beginning to snap. We broke up so long ago and I’ve been in a longterm relationship since. He’s just been job hopping, blacking out and still lives with his Mom (in his late 30’s). 

I don’t know what to do- he’s so fragile and creepy and frantic. I don’t feel safe if I upset him. He’s spiraling. 

I’m open to any advice"
relationship_advice,My (24 M) ex girlfriend (21 F) is destroying our friend group because I broke up with her. How can I try to unify and keep my friend group intact?,"My ex and I have a large intersection of friends and our break up has caused a huge rift because of the circumstances of the break up. We broke up because I no longer am attracted to her. I know I’ll get lit up by this sub for the reason why but here goes. She came out to me that she is bisexual and finds women attractive. That is a huge turn off for me and makes me uncomfortable to the point where I don’t want to be intimate with her. I was honest to her about it and said that I hope we can be friends but that she deserves to be with someone who can be intimate with her. 

She completely freaked out on me and has called me biphobic and sexist, even though I am none of those things. I was the only person she has come out to so I understand why she is upset and I honestly did not mean to diminish her sexuality or imply that it is wrong. I just can’t be with a woman who is attracted to other women. Anyway afterwards she told our friend group that we broke up because I was a bigot and a homophobe and didn’t expand. My friends, concerned about this approached me because they are concerned about her and my actions and wanted to know what was going on. So I told the truth. This then led to her being “outed” by me because I told people her sexuality. But I wouldn’t have done that if she didn’t attack my character and had our friends concerned about me. So now our friend group is divided. Some are taking her side saying that I am a bigot and that I shouldn’t have outed her. Some are taking my side saying that it was good of me to break things off early and being honest about things and that she shouldn’t have made these attacks on my character without me being able to explain the situation.

Anyway the whole thing is a mess. On top of the emotional anguish that comes with a breakup, I’m dealing with friend group drama that has now spiraled out of just our breakup but to other people in our friend group. My ex apparently felt betrayed by one our friends and told her boyfriend she cheated on him, which may or may not be true. It’s just a mess and I’m trying to do the right thing. I knew it was going to be hard to break up with my ex, but being honest and up front is what I live by. I am mot ashamed that I lost my attractiveness to her because of her bisexuality. I cannot control who I am and am not attracted to and I really tried not to let it affect me but it has. And she deserves someone that will find her attractive in all ways. 

I feel like my entire social circle has been fractured and that friendships that have lasted years will now dissipate. Is there something I can do to salvage any of these friendships?"
relationship_advice,My ex contacted me saying he regrets breaking up with me. Do I even respond?,"Sorry... a lot of background. My ex was always a “grass is always greener on the other side” kind of person, and super interested in other cultures and traveling. We met when I studied abroad in his country.  I knew I wanted to return to his country after graduation for work, so we decided to keep things up long distance when I returned home.  

About 6 months later he messaged me that he got an internship in Thailand, and if things worked out he might want to stay permanently. Basically hinting a breakup might happen unless I decide to get a job in Thailand with him, which wasn’t going to happen. I was stressed. 

He wasn’t happy with the work culture in Thailand when he actually got there, and said he had trouble making friends. He sent me this long sappy love letter message saying he was an idiot for even considering leaving me, his family, and friends in his home country.  Things were fine again. 

I graduated and moved to his country and our relationship was normal again. But a year later he got the travel bug again and basically broke up with me to move to yet another country for a permanent job.  We were both sick of long distance and him hinting at breaking up in person hurt a lot.  We ended up breaking up. 

I moved on and have a wonderful new bf, and see that my ex keeps country hopping as some sort of laborer?  He messaged me yesterday with a similar sappy message saying he was an idiot for breaking up with me, that he was with other girls (I was his first gf) and didn’t realize how great I actually was until he realized the things he liked about me weren’t the “norm”. 

I have no idea how he expects me to react, but I got over him long ago.  There was no “give me another chance” or question or apology or anything.  

Why would he send this in the first place?  He knows I have a boyfriend and he’d literally still be a flight risk again anyway.  Maybe I shouldn’t respond but I would feel bad just ignoring it when obviously he’s in a vulnerable place mentally.  I just have no idea what to say."
relationship_advice,I’m (19F) getting to breaking point with trying to get my boyfriend (22M) to get off video games and actually do stuff with me,"I love my boyfriend so much. We met when I was in another state and he’d travel across the country for me. We’d have the most amazing dates and have so much fun doing spontaneous crazy things. 

Now it’s an absolute effort for me to get him to do anything. I have to bargain with him and plead with him to get him to go out with me even to the shops. I have spoken to him about it nearly 4 times quite seriously and he gets upset each time but nothing changes. He never comes up with an idea of something for us to do either. It’s always on me. 

I don’t want to lose him because despite this he means a lot to me and provides a lot of emotional support. But I’m so bored of just sitting around while he plays games. Please help me!!"

relationship_advice,My(23f) best friend(25f) is jealous of my son(9Months),"Since my son was born, my best friend has become extremely weird about me being a parent. She invites me out every week and gets offended when I don’t show up. She seems to think that I’m using my child as an excuse to avoid her. 

I’m a single mom with no family nearby so it’s really difficult to find a sitter. On top of that, my friend only ever wants to go out and drink and do drugs. I like to enjoy a cocktail now and then but she wants to drink to the point where we black out. Even if my son isn’t with me, I don’t feel comfortable drinking to the point of incoherence. When it comes to drugs, I never partake due to breastfeeding. She always tries to push me to do drugs and has literally blown weed smoke in my face as an attempt to get me high. She doesn’t care that what I ingest is passed onto the baby and it’s really upsetting that she’s trying to gaslight me and claim that I’m a bad friend because I don’t want to do mushrooms, ecstasy, or ketamine with her. I’ve tried to explain my feelings to her and usually she agrees but come the next weekend, she’s doing the same shit. 

She doesn’t realize that a night of heavy drinking equates to a hangover that can make it extremely difficult to be patient and caring with a baby. I love my friend especially since we’ve known each other since grade 7 however, I’m starting to get really irritated by her behavior. 

A few weeks ago, she told me that she was looking up how to not be jealous about a friends baby. I just couldn’t believe her audacity in telling me this and the fact that she’s jealous that I’m choosing to be a good parent rather than a neglectful one. 

Should I just let her go?

TLDR: best friend of over a decade is jealous of my baby and I’m at the point where I’m ready to cut her off but not sure if I’m overreacting"
relationship_advice,I asked him about his sex life and he got offended (22F),So I asked a guy that I’ve been talking to for a few months who he last had sex with and he told me that it was with his ex two years ago. He seemed offended and he said that he was annoyed that something like that would even matter. He has asked me lots of questions about my sexual life (granted I don’t have much to say) and he seems to enjoy sexual conversations usually. Did I do something wrong? Do you understand his reaction?

relationship_advice,Did (21)I make the right choice by downloading tinder after so little time?,"So I broke up with my SO, two weeks ago. I wasn’t happy nor in love anymore and felt like I would rob him from actually meeting someone better that could share the same values and dreams as them. 

I felt pretty disappointed since July and most of my emotions started to change drastically in the last 4 months until everything ended on January. This week I downloaded tinder and created a profile, I don’t know if I moved on too fast since I have talked about my ex a lot this past week but feel like I should lose my fear of actually falling head over heels...

I’m kinda scared of over rationalizing my own emotions, realizing I’m avoiding to feel anything about a major break up, yet sane only too real when not knowing who we are at all... I’m really sad right now, I don’t know if I made the right choice I’ve seen there are few people actually interested in me but I wouldn’t really like to lead them on...

What should I do? 

TLDR: I broke up a long relationship(2years) and downloaded tinder, don’t know if I should feel bad in case I decide to close it for a while ?"
relationship_advice,Is love overrated?,"My bf (26M) and I (24F) are very compatible. We have the same worldview, share interests and he ticks so many of my boxes of what I want in a partner. He also treats me like a princess. There is so much I like about him, but I’m not sure if I’m in love with him. I stay with him because I can’t imagine finding anyone more compatible who makes me feel as special as he does.. Should I marry him or find someone that I am certain I am “in love” with..? Is love overrated anyway?"
relationship_advice,I’m in a Interracial relationship but getting tired of the racist jokes.,So as you can guess I’m in a relationship with a black bf and I’m a white woman. I can handle jokes but lately all of his jokes have been leaning towards the color of my skin or white stereotypes. His first joke within in our relationship while we were talking about making dinner he said something along the lines “I’m going to have to teach you how to season your chicken because you white people don’t know how to make a chicken the proper way.” I kinda felt awkward about this comment because he assumed I didn’t know how to cook chicken based on my skin color which I have no idea what that has to do with making a chicken and I just laughed it off and pretended it didn’t bug me as much. Fast forward to a few days later we got into a deep discussion about our exes and how we were treated in our previous relationships and when I was done telling him about my past relationship my boyfriend turned around and said “Must suck to see him still during family gatherings.” Implying that I dated one of my family members. I was really mad about this comment and I told him that he was being kind of racist and how it was inappropriate to say that about one of my family members and he proceeds to say you can’t be racist to a white person because blacks were oppressed and that it is just a joke and I needed to get over it. At this point I went on about how that is unfair for him to just brush of my feelings and making me feel guilty for calling him out on his inappropriate racist jokes. I asked him how he would like it if a dropped the “n” word around and he said I can’t compare that to his “harmless jokes” because I have white privilege and he doesn’t.
relationship_advice,Ending of a relationship,"So I woke up one morning with some morning wood and I did what every man does (or would think they do)  I beat it out and wanted to go back to sleep but my girlfriend (at the time) was annoyed about it and suggested I should do it in the bathroom. As requested I took my business to the bathroom and I got back to my room she was very angry about how I handled the situation. So I thought going into the next room would let the situation settle (it’s 6:30 in the morning) but like always it made it even worse,she continued to tell me that if this is what I care about then I need help. (already In thearpy because of our previous break up she did not follow up with her counselor) My question is am I an asshole for going about the actions I took?"
relationship_advice,do i (17f) have the right to be mad at my boyfriend(16m)?,"so my boyfriend has this ex (lets call her J)he dated over summer before we got together for around 2 weeks. he said he really didnt have feelings for her and blah blah. well, his best friend (well call him D), is J's step brother so J stays at D's house sometimes  and my boyfriend often stays at D's house. two nights ago, we had a conversation for some reason about who our first guesses would be of if he or i cheated who our first guesses would be and i said J. later that night he stayed there and didnt tell me that his ex (J) was there staying too. the next morning he calls me to his friends locker and says he has to tell me something really important, but before he tells me his friend tells him not to say anything. so now im freaking out and in my next class i text him and ask him what it was. he tells me that they thought itd be funny to tell me that my bf had sex with J the night before. i obviously was pretty upset that they would joke about that especially since he knows that every relationship ive been in ive been cheated on. i was so upset because then i started thinking how suspicious it was about the timing and i started to wonder if he really did. i really do trust him but its so hard not to think that he did and now i have the image of them having sex stuck in my head. its very frustrating because he kept telling me i shouldnt be mad or i dont have the right to be. am i just overreacting?????"
relationship_advice,Is it okay to want tangible commitment?,"Hey friends - what do you/ did you need to feel ""committed"" in a relationship? Is it wrong to need different forms of commitment from your S.O.?

My fiance (he/him) 28, me (she/her, they/them) 25, have decided to get married. My partner proposed to me off-the -cuff one evening in a cute, but untraditional way. He proposed without a ring (which is fine), but adds on him seeming hesitant to commit to the relationship in any way that would make it more than emotionally difficult to break up with me. We live together, but I moved out of my house into his studio apartment because it was downtown in the city we're close to (Western NC) and he doesn't drive (and lives where he can walk to work). 

We have made tentative plans about moving into a new place together, sometime when the lease is up for this apartment towards the end of March. I'm already looking for places, but his interest/excitement/help in this endeavor is nonexistent. He isn't much of a future planner, but knows that I am, and that it is important to me. 

Every single day he does his best to make me laugh and smile, and loves and adores me. He is a wonderful person, and makes me so happy. He has stuck by me through thick and thin the last year, as I've been struggling with chronic illness. I love him more than it feels like the word describes, but I still am craving some kind of link for our relationship. 

He isn't interested to combining our finances into one pot (but has agreed to contribute money to a shared account for shared expenses), and often points out reasons we might need to rehome our dog, but never actually makes any steps towards doing so (Puppy, high energy, just under a year old - mostly the issue with her is lots of energy in a small space). I know he loves me, i just want something to know that the love isn't temporary. 

There are probably a billion things I'm forgetting to add that are relevant, but as a general question, am I being totally silly? Should I just be wrapping my arms tightly around this tremendous, unconditional love and contributing my worries to previous unhappy relationships and general anxiety about everything? Or does it make some kind of sense to have a desire for some kind of tangible commitment?

Much love, thanks for taking the time to read 💙"
relationship_advice,Weird question but I’m curious...,"My half brother and I are 10 years apart. He is (28M) and I am (18F). 

Now our dad was married to his mum years ago, they had a divorce then my dad got married to my mum, they waited 5 years after their marriage to have a kid which resulted to me. My half brother was 10 when I was born. 

Now, his mother got married and immediately had kids who are technically not related to me. Cause his mother I share no blood. But I’m curious, my half brother has another half brother due to their mum. What would it mean if I dated my half brothers, half brother? That wouldn’t result to incest because we aren’t related. Would our relation be right or wrong?"
relationship_advice,I (19M) am about to propose to girlfriend (22F). Am I moving too quickly?,"I (19M) have planned to propose to my partner (22F) of one year sometime in the next few months. Now I know a lot of y'all are probably thinking ""aren't you a little young to be getting married?"" or ""you've only been together a year! Shouldn't you wait a bit?"" these are both questions I've carefully considered.

My partner and I have extensively discussed the topic of marriage. She wants to have a ring on her finger essentially as soon as I'm ready- and as of right now, I definitely don't see us ever not being together. Even after a year of togetherness it still feels as though we've just started dating. Our 'fights' have never really been actual fights, just reasoned discussions in which one or both of us always makes a change to accomodate the others' concern. I feel safe and secure in her presence in ways that I've never felt with anyone else. 

Even with saying this, I probably would have wanted to wait another year before a proposal just to make sure we are long-term compatible. However, we've planned a years long trip around Europe to begin in 2021 and logistically speaking, it makes sense to be married before we leave, while we're still in our own country with all our friends and family. Neither I, nor her, have displayed any signs of hesitancy around the plan to be married by the end of the year. I know that I feel especially confident that she's the one.

In spite of this, my dad had a conversation with me yesterday talking about how getting married young is always a mistake. He is a divorcee, himself. Having been cheated on by my mother after over 15 years of marriage. He described once seeing my mother in very similar ways to how I see my own partner- and while I'm 100% sure I'm not going to get cheated on, it did make me wonder if waiting for the sake of a little bit extra added security might be beneficial.

So, essentially what I'm asking is this: Is it reasonable to propose as young as I am? Or is my head-over-heelsness clouding my judgement? Do any of you have experiences marrying young? Any help with this conundrum would be greatly appreciated.  


tldr: About to propose after one year of dating. Wondering if we're moving too fast."
relationship_advice,Pitiful,"It's been five year since we broke up, it was her decision she's moved on, I thought I had too but I see now I might not have I still think about her. I truly believe I loved her and I fear that she might view that part of her life as nothing more than childs play when it was the realest thing I've ever had and have not been able to find a connection anywhere near that since and what hurts me most is that I desperately want to go back to being friends like before but we can't even maintain a conversation. I guess we're not the same people anymore but can't seem to let go of what I once felt. Advice?"
relationship_advice,Is this interrupting or am I?,"So I just yelled at my partner because they interrupted me whilst talking... Again.

OK, so all the time, I'll start talking or telling him something, and then he will cut me off and start talking. I'll push through it sometimes, other times I'll give him a look and he'll stop and I'll continue, but it can happen multiple times in a row, just to tell be about something that could have waited.

This time, I just blew up and yelled ""can you please not interrupt me when I'm talking?!?"" and his response is to say ""I was just talking to myself. I'm allowed to do that, you can just keep going"", talking about himself. The reality is, when he talks how am I meant to know it's to himself, and he does this many times a day and it completely crushes my momentum and what I'm saying.

It's not like I haven't told him not to do it and he says sorry, but to try and say now that I'm taking away his right to talk to himself by being mad when he talks over me? Am I crazy... Or is he just making a bullshit excuse?

*tldr: boyfriend talks to ""himself"" while I'm talking and saying I'm in the wrong for getting upset."
relationship_advice,Girlfriend (20) is a bit jealous that I (M20) play the video games we play together by myself sometimes,"Let me preface this by saying we've been dating almost 2 years and our relationship is perfectly healthy. Here and there we've been spending our free time together playing video games, like sports games and fighting games. I've always been a gamer, albeit a casual one, while my girlfriend was mostly a stranger to video games before me - she dabbled in her DS when she was younger. But yeah, we have fun playing games and we enjoy progressing our skills together. However since I own the console, I obviously have more time with the games, so by the next time she picks up the game again with me, I'm a bit better every time. This is an area where she feels self-conscious, I suppose. When it comes to competitive games, I have to ease up or it's unfair. I personally don't have a problem with easing up/the skill gap between us, but I do understand her frustration.

Recently I picked up Rocket League and we've been playing it together and we're having an absolute blast. However it's getting to the point where I feel like I can't play it by myself in my free time because the same situation is going to happen. We've talked about it a bit, and I dislike that this is a sore spot for us. Can anyone offer some insight on this situation? Thank you for the help."
relationship_advice,Good first date idea?,"I’m not great at first dates and usually go for coffee/drinks but getting bored of that routine. 

Met a girl I’m into &amp; an old friend of mine is playing a show next Friday (used to work in music they’re actually averagely successful not just some shitty show). Is inviting her to come to the show with me a decent date idea? Does that sound like a date? Or just hanging out?"
relationship_advice,"I (18M) feel very lonely, and am desperate for some form of close relationship whether it's through dating or friendship. I have recently befriended a girl (21F) who has been the first actual friend I have had in such a long time, but I am not sure how to develop anything more. (TLDR at bottom)","This is a kind of complicated situation so it may be a very long and ranty post, but essentially I am feeling very lonely, and have not had any friends since primary school. A week ago I turned 18, and apart from some family who felt obligated, I  got no birthday wishes. I didn't even have a cake or anything. The whole ordeal was pretty depressing, and 18 is supposed to be a big deal. It's not really because I'm terribly shy, in fact I enjoy public speaking and have made acquaintances in class easily enough, I just never really get to the actual friend stage, This is due to a bunch of reasons including my parents having a rough divorce forcing me to move around the world a bunch, plus me having Asperger's.

I'm now in university, and I've meet a girl who is the first person I'd really call a friend in such a long time. Essentially I meet her in class, and found we shared lot's of interests, so I invited her out, something I never really did before. Long story a bit shorter, I clumsy became friends with her, and was very awkward and immature many times, despite this she stuck by. I even told her about my Asperger's, and she assured me that it's fine, as she is pretty shy and socially awkward herself. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and I generally really like her, and relate to her, like more than I have liked anyone before...

So yeah, I have kind of fallen for her... She's 3 and a half years older than me, and is generally much more mature than me. And frankly I'm pretty certain she does not feel the same way about me. However this is not even my problem. I would like to be in a relationship yes, but if I'm being honest I'm not even sure I'm mature enough to be in a relationship. What I'm really looking for most, is closeness, something I have never found in a friend before so I guess I was looking for in a relationship. Along with this stability and longevity, because I want friendship that won't die as soon we change classes, and something I don't feel like I constantly maintain on my end. 

The problem is that I'm not really sure how much she likes me, even as a friend. A few days ago, I went to the theater with her, and I've sorta suggested doing something else in the coming weeks, but I want to be with her more, and spend more time with her. The thing is, she's not super willing to do things that much, mainly because she's just busy with school (as am I), and I think I have gotten obsessed with her. I'm not really sure what to do though, as she is pretty much my only friend, and as pathetic as it seems, the only thing giving me some much needed purpose to life as of late. I would like to be honest about some of my confusion, and even my feelings with her, but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable, or ruin the friendship we do have. 

In terms of making other friends, and not just relying on one, I know, but frankly I have no interest in making surface level friends to hang out with, I just want one or two close ones. Like I already get basic social interaction in school, so that's not really a problem. It'd just be nice to at least get a wish on my birthday I guess... I don't know what to do, I can't give up on this girl, or just abandon her because ""it's not working out"", it is working out, it's the most a relationship has worked out with me in many years. The problem is that I am not fulfilled, I would like something more but I don't know how to get it.

TLDR: I am very lonely and have not had close friends since primary school. Now that I am in university I meet a girl been the first actual friend I have had in such a long time. Were both shy and nerdy history students, and we have been texting and hanging out quite a bit. I generally really like her, and relate to her, more than I have liked anyone before, and I have kind of fallen for her. But I don't think she feels the same way, nor do I think I am mature enough for a relationship. I'm confused on what I want, but I think that I am really looking for closeness, stability, and longevity, whether it's through dating or friendship, but I'm not sure how in both cases."

relationship_advice,I (33f) messed up and almost messed up again,"Ok so a little back story: I have major insecurities from a bad childhood and from really bad relationships.  I've been abandoned by everyone I loved and cheated on.  

To the reason why I'am writing this.  

A few years after my longest and most recent relationship.  I finally met a wonderful good guy. (44m) We been together for a year and a half now.  Well things were going great until i found out he keeps in touch with a old ex.  So with my insecurities (which he knows about) I tell him how I feel weird about it (I don't mind friends that are girls just exs, every relationship has been ruined by the ""don't worry about them"" ex.)  but he reassures me there is nothing to it, that he doesn't talk to her and has seen her in a long time.  He went on to tell me how he doesn't see her like that and it was a long time ago when they had a thing.  Well after that conversation some time passed and I saw her bubble pop up.  I didn't say anything I just started overthinking and it got to the point where I did the big no no.  I went through his phone(found nothing) so I went to facebook and sure enough I found out (no cheating though) that the friend he said ""not to worry about"" he lied.  They talked like everyday and I found a pic of them kissing three months before he met me.  It was before me but it bothers me he lied about it.  What hurt the most was he's joking with her how they can't make out any more (she lives in another state) and how I'm super jealous and how he wishes it was different but because I've been with a real dirt bag that they need to stop talking to ease my mind.  Well he found out I went through his stuff and was pissed.  I don't blame him.  I've been working through my insecurities and just repeat to myself, if i can be faith so can he. After he cooled down things were good and I've been really good with my insecurities but today wasn't a good day for me.  With all the stress and still working on my insecurities I start to overthink shit.  So I see his old phone and I turn it on.  Thank god it was slow.  It gave me time to think: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?! NO NO!!!  So I turn it off.  But now I feel bad that i wanted to stoop that low again and not trust him.  So should I tell him what I almost did?

I have known him since we were in 7th grade, our first kiss was in 8th grade, and we started officially dating sophomore year. I love this man. More than I have ever loved anyone else. He is so good to me and kind and we have a great relationship. We are both at the same college out of state together, and we have built a wonderful life here together and we have the same friend group. In some ways, although I’m so young, I feel as if I’m married to him. I have never dated anyone else.

I have a class where this guy sits next to me every single class. We usually get to class early, so we end up talking for thirty minutes before and after each class. I feel so horrible and awful for saying this, but I think I have a crush on him. I’m trying not to think about him, but I can’t stop thinking about him and it’s tearing me apart. He’s so handsome and kind and down to earth, and it sucks so much that I’m developing some sort of feelings for him. Now in no way would I EVER act on these feelings, especially while being together with my boyfriend. I don’t think I could ever forgive myself for that. I don’t know. I feel like a cheater even though I haven’t done anything.

Am I horrible for having these thoughts? What is your take on all of this?"
relationship_advice,need some simple advice on how to put myself out there,"This post is honestly a low priority post but seriously I need to ask. Long story short, I’m still struggling after the best person I’ve ever met left me over 6 months ago. I will always love him, but it’s tearing me apart. I’m in college and in this one lecture, I saw this guy. Dear lord I had to do a double take and it was the first time my cheeks have gotten flushed since my ex. I just want to find a way to move on and meet new people and become a better person. But honestly I have no game period. I have never been the one to make a first move. But I’m always the one making the moves after that. I see him twice a week and I try to look cute as hell, sit right in front of him and make eye contact. I know there’s a chance he doesn’t really want that attention but I want to straight up walk to him and tell him I think he’s attractive and give him my number. But again, I have no game. I seriously don’t even know what to start with, like I need a script because there really isn’t a way to just small talk, we just have lecture together. Anyways (I said long story short lol). Thank you if you’ve read this far but a girl needs some tips so I can just put myself out there."
relationship_advice,Is it wrong for me (26F) to be put off by what my Bf (27m) said to me?,"My boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) have been together about 3 years. 

Tonight we went out to a nice restaurant and I mentioned that I might go to Australia for a couple weeks for work. I asked him if he might want to come along and he said he was interested. 

Then he said, “why don’t you go to Australia for 6 months?” I responded that I wouldn’t want to go without him for that long. 

He then said, “why? If I could go to Australia for 6 months I would in a heartbeat.” I then said “what about me?” And he said that I could go visit him. 

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting to this, but I was hurt that he said that so easily, and I would’ve at least wanted it to be a more serious discussion where my feelings where taken into account.

Am I overreacting to this or should I just let it go?"
relationship_advice,"Girlfriend stopped smoking for me, but recently got the chance to smoke again.","So I need some help, me (M18) and my current girlfriend (F19) just had a massive argument about weed. When we started dating, she smoked weed a lot to relieve stress, but within the “stress relief” she would often smoke with friends or at parties. While I don’t smoke, or even like it. I’ve never been a fan of smoking or drinking, while she believes it’s fine. A few months into our relationship (we both work together) the one day I don’t work, she does and doesn’t tell me she got sent home early and written up. So I go in the next day and find it all out first hand. So I immediately go up to her and ask her, she firmly denies it, until I have to bring up all the people who told me what she did. She got sent home because her and a few coworkers(all guys) were smoking outback of the restaurant. So they all got sent home and written up. She never once told me she was hanging out with this guy, and never once said that she got sent home. I’ve always just accepted the fact that, I guess it happens. So for the next few months she’s completely quit smoking because she doesn’t have the money, and she knows that I don’t like it. So thankfully she understands why I’m not a huge fan of smoking, it’s expensive and causes problems. So now, as of yesterday, her old friend came to pickup a coworker and she went into the car and took a hit off a blunt with me sitting right in front of her on the bench. So I casually went up to her after she was done and said “I thought you gave up smoking” when clearly she just took a hit. She said something along the lines of “I need to relieve stress I’ve been having a rough day, it should be fine if I do it every now and again” and at that point I had enough, I said “you know how I feel, you changed, but it feels like I’m the reason why you’re always stressed out” then we started arguing over why she should smoke weed. So at the end of it all, the last words that she said were “I want to keep smoking” and with that we stopped arguing.

TLDR: Girlfriend stopped smoking for me and her wellbeing, then friend let her smoke with her, and now she wants to smoke again

What should I do about this? I don’t know if I should be worried about her going behind my back again and smoking with coworkers, or ex’s, or whoever. I’m really confused. Any help would be appreciated!"
relationship_advice,I’m (F18) and my boyfriend (21) of two and a half years is insiting I tell my mom about our relationship,"Hi all, my boyfriend has recently been insisting that I tell my mom about our relationship but I am honestly really scared. We are of hispanic background but she is against me dating hispanics who are more Amerindian than European. I haven’t told him about this. The first time she knew about us I was a minor then and she took my phone away from me saying that I was “too good” for him. She even ignored me for the longest and constantly said she was disappointed in me and that affected me alot, I really don’t want to go through that trauma again. I am afraid she will also manipulate my father to take my car away too. Thinking about telling her the truth makes me tear up I have no idea what to do. When she first found out she said that men like what they see and girls like what they hear and that he only treats me good because he wants to manipulate me. I know that is not at all true, any advice?"
relationship_advice,Coworker (22f) and I (22f) are not friends anymore. She is also the boss' daughter. How to deal...,"So as the title says, I am not friends with my coworker anymore and I feel awkward and alienated at work. The reason I stopped was because I thought she was too manipulative towards me and has a tendency to have me 'relate' to her when she says her opinion even when I don't agree. I never wanted to stop being her friend but when I told her that I wanted a break from our friendship she took it as you're either with me or against me type of thing. I've come to realize that I am kind of weak-minded and I let her take advantage of me because I don't like making decisions for myself. At work, she is a very charismatic person and everyone (!!!) loves talking with her and she knows it. I've also let her know mostly all of my insecurities and she'll bring up snide comments with other people that I kind of feel like they're about me. Her mom is my boss and they act the exact same way; making rude comments about others but passing it off as jokes or 'roasts', making snide comments about me getting my priorities straight, and just knowing how to push my buttons. (I wear my heart and feelings on my sleeve/face lol). 

Today I kind of felt like it was the last straw. Her mom will bring up things that we have done together with her daughter but not in a direct way (?), like this store is selling shirts that we had bought together one time or if I shop at the Walmart that I used to shop with my friend still. The whole time I was working I was just thinking about quitting right then and there but I feel like that would be losing. 

Now my coworker doesn't even acknowledge me and talks around me as if I'm not there. I don't know if this post made sense or if I should go see a therapist because I feel like I'm going to bubble over and explode at these people and I don't want to. I know my boss and coworker are talking with each other on probably how to deal with me but I don't know if I can give them the satisfaction of losing me because I can't handle it and I don't have another job lined up."
relationship_advice,Need advice about a girl I work with.,"Situation:

I  work with a girl. She ended up being super charming. Normally I have my  'castle walls' up so damn high, not letting anyone in; but she sang around me and did this little dance when I first met her and for whatever reason it seems like shes been inside my castle walls ever since, and I havent wanted to kick her out, either. I'm pretty sure she likes me. She flirts with me, says the most sexual things around me.  She  will touch and hit me playfully. Or comment on my ass lmao. I really want to tell her  something  about how I feel but she has a  boyfriend so idk what to do. Should I just  stay her 'co-worker/friend'  who she  flirts excessively with? Or should I  tell her something like  ""I wish I  could take you on a date"". Or  anything smaller than that  like 'youre  charming' or something. Im not trying to help her cheat tbh, I dont even have  her phone number and wont try to get it unless I feel  like she really needs me or something.

Im  not  trying to blow  her out of the water with the sentiment, just being able to open up  even a little bit to be genuine with her about how she effects me seems  like it would help alleviate some pressure from me or something. It sucks being soo close to someone who constantly flirts with you and  seeming like you shouldnt get close to them. And maybe if  Im lucky she  can take it well / maturely or just tell me off so I can put some space  between us if needs be.

So  what does everyone think? I was leaning towards just 1 well thought out compliment. Or saying something in a roundabout way like ""You seem like you'd be a fun date"" or something.

If you reply please if you are a guy or a girl, and how old you are."
relationship_advice,what the fuck,"Hi, me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) have been dating for about a year, recently she started texting one of her ex boyfriends which really doesn't bother me other than the fact that if i even look in another females direction its a problem. Anyways, I looked through her dms today (terrible idea i know) and i found her respond to his story which said,""tell me something you wouldn't tell your parents."" She replies, ""I like to be fucked like ive been acting up."" Am i fucking crazy or is this a totally inappropriate thing to fucking text your ex boyfriend?"
relationship_advice,[M]e 29 got back together with my g[F] 26,"Long story short, she broke up with me for what she explained was a mistake that she made without proper communication and thought. We spent about a month apart in which she had sexual encounters with other guys. Something that she says is a coping mechanism for pain and break up. I on the other hand was just heart broken and didn't even think about being intimate with someone. To each their own.

So we've talked things out and we're back together. But I have trust issues and they're beginning to weigh on me. I always have trusted her before the break up, and I try to give her the benefit of the doubt. She hasn't given me a reason in the past to not trust her word. But personally I can't help but constantly think that there is a chance she's going to make the choice to be unfaithful.

I'm currently pushing through it alone. But what keeps throwing me off is that she has quite a few guy friends and some of them she's had sex with. One of them is someone she had sex with recently when we broke up.

I've talk to her about it, her boundaries, their relationship, I've asked questions and she wants to be transparent. I just don't quite understand being friends with someone and having sex with them occasionally, then just cutting it off once you're in a relationship. As if there was no desire in the first place.

I care about her very much, and I want to be with her. It's just very tough on me right now. Trying to wrap my head around everything that's going on.

Any thoughts or advise?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend said she’s too good for me,Idk what to do. Idk if she’s kidding or not
relationship_advice,My trust issues are back and ruining my relationship,"I (m 17) have been dating my girlfriend (f 16) for more than a year now,it has always been a great relationship,she has been considerate of my insecurities and trust issues as she had her own as well(probably even worse than mine), things started getting really bad last month around Christmas,she started talking to a dude (m 18), let's call him G.  I was always skeptical of him as with my experience with being a manipulative person in the past and dealing with multiple manipulative people, I can sense manipulative people from a mile, I could see him using the the manipulative fuckboy tactics and let her know that he seems sketchy to me, she ignored my advice and kept talking and flirting with him, mostly in group chats too where I could see her doing that, now with my trust issues,I couldn't really see that so I asked her to just not flirt with him at places where I can see it,even if it's as a joke it hurts me and makes me feel odd,she listened and I didn't see her flirting on group chats after that,it was around the 18th of December last year when she was just exchanging a few flirty texts with him and for the first time they genuinely turned her on, she immediately told me and was extremely sorry about it, I was quite disappointed and expected her to not talk to him again or at least not flirt with him again which she did not and shut him down every time he tried again, it was our first anniversary on Christmas Eve and she was really drunk, that night was one of my most horrible ones, not only she forced me to video sex with her to the point that I had to cry to make her stop as she was drunk and it felt wrong, but she also fucked up my self esteem pretty bad, soon after I literally cried and begged her to not video call me and show me her naked body(as she wasn't in her senses), she asked if we could at least phone sex, she already made me feel extremely guilty for denying her what she wanted so I couldn't deny, when we started,while we were doing it, she said "" kiss me all over G),that really fucked me up and made me cry even more, I still couldn't leave her alone as she was drunk and I didn't know what she could've done to her self, I sang her to sleep and thought of talking to her the next day. She was really guilty for both the things she did and we decided to take a break to figure things out, she admitted that she felt attracted to him and she kept talking to him as she loved the attention, it was clear that she had horrible self esteem issues and that made her extremely vulnerable, for the first time I realised how easy it was to make her cheat on me, really made me question everything and then obviously I found Reddit where I read hundreds of cheating stories, that combined with my trust issues really fucked my brain well and good,after a couple of days of break, I realised that in November she made a catfishing account to ""test"" my loyalty lmao, that made me even more furious but I wanted to make things work, she means a lot to me, she said she won't talk to that guy again and will get therapy for her self esteem issues,it has been a month after that happened, she hasn't taken any therapy and she still talks to him way more than she talks to me(I can't talk to her a lot as my finals are just 20 days away),I don't know what to do, every time she fucks up she promises to get better but doesn't do anything to get better, my trust issues are getting worse each day, I have talked to her about it but she's gleefully blaming it all on my trust issues and not willing to take any responsibility for changing her own behavior, really need your advice, sorry for making it so long it's my first Reddit post

T L D R: girlfriend of one year was attracted to another dude, called me by his name during phone sex on our anniversary, promised to take therapy for her low self esteem but didn't, promised to not talk to him but still does every day, need your advice on what to do"
relationship_advice,My partner (27M) May have a hereditary condition that I (26F) don’t want to pass on to children. He says adoption is off the table. Is this a deal breaker?,"This may be above Reddit’s pay grade, but let’s give it a go. 

Essentially my partner may have a hereditary condition that’s kind of like MS. He may lose gross motor function gradually over time. His dad is in his late 50s and is wheelchair bound, can’t handle small utensils (forks, pencils, etc.), and essentially will need a full time care taker in the next 5-10 years. There are no cognitive effects. 

My partner has a 50/50 chance of having these genes. He refuses to get his DNA tested and I have honoured his choice. He says that he wants to live a normal life and doesn’t feel like he could do that if he knew he has the condition. His entire family shares this mentality; no one has ever had any genetic testing and they just take it as it comes. As multiple members of the family have the condition, they see it as just a reality of their lives. 

We have been together for almost three years and we’re starting to figure out if marriage is on the table. I may seem to be really relaxed about this whole situation, but truthfully it’s pretty hard for me to wrap my head around it. To be totally honest, if I had known early on in the relationship that his dad’s condition was genetic I probably would have ended things. I don’t want to be a caretaker for the rest of my life. However, I’m also positive this is my person and I can’t imagine not being with him. We and I alone have been to multiple therapy sessions, talked it over with family and friends, and I’ve decided that I want to be with him, for better or for worse. 

However. 

We both want children, but I just don’t want to risk passing his condition onto children. We’ve talked about adoption and my partner feels like he just wouldn’t be able to love a child that isn’t his own. He says he’s been looking forward to going through pregnancy with a partner and this is a milestone he can’t imagine not doing. Fair enough. 

I suggested genetic counselling, and we’ve looked into a bit. The problem is this will require us to find out if he has the condition.  He is committed to not knowing. It also costs a TON of money, but in my opinion it’s worth it if we can guarantee that our children will be born without the condition.  

My opinion is that we’re going to figure it out eventually. I would like to be prepared financially, mentally and emotionally before we get to that point. I also am trying to empathize with his situation. I can’t imagine knowing that in 20-30 years you’re going to be wheel chair bound. 

Because of this unique situation, it’s imperative that we’re on the same page about everything before committing to each other. We’ve been extremely proactive about how finances will work, life/disability insurance, goals, milestones, etc. This is the one situation we’ve come across that we just can’t seem to find a solution for. I feel like I’m being extremely reasonable and I just think this is something I’m not going to budge on.

relationship_advice,Dealing with Married Woman,"I(51) made a post the other day about walking away from my girlfriend (48) last week. Well, she called me Tuesday night and cussed me out for being insensitive. First, let me give you a little background.  
My girlfriend and I started dating about six years ago. At the time she was still married, so it started off as an affair. But in the summer of 2015 she finally moved out and six months later I moved in with her and her daughter. We lived together for about two years and soon began to discuss marriage even though she hadn’t even talked to a lawyer about getting a divorce from her husband. Over that span she began going and doing more and more with her husband. Started out as going out once or twice a month with the daughter and then evolved into 3-4 times a week and a couple of vacations a year. Two years ago she bought a house next to her husband. The whole time she was telling me it was so the daughter (16) could be closer to her dad.  
The daughter is now 18 and my gf is going out every day with her husband, with the daughter going with them about 1 out of every 5 days. She now tells me she goes out with him to keep him from griping and so he will provide for their daughter, he is very wealthy.  
Now to my problem. I don’t believe that there is anything going between them physically. She vehemently denies it and I do believe her. However, I have acted in a very jealous manner over the last few years and she says this has pushed her away. She says she still loves me though and would be willing to work on us when she gets things resolved in her life. She quit talking to me for thirty days last April and then out of the blue called me and wanted to make up telling that she was suffering from depression. In the past if I had made her mad she would quit talking to me for three or four days but always came back after I would beg and plead with her. There has always been these hot and cold cycles with her. It has gotten to the point where we only see each other about once every couple of months, talk on the phone for about ten minutes once a week, and maybe a couple texts each day. Last week I asked her if she were planning on getting back together with her husband. Her only response was she wasn’t sure what was going to happen. Exactly what she says about the possibility of us getting together in the future. Anyway, I walked away last week but she called me the other day cussing me out.  
She was angry that I had not texted her that I was sorry for asking that question. When I have apologized in the past she says that they are meaningless. Then she started accusing me of talking to someone else (which I am not). She has always accused me of talking to someone else or cheating on her. That was her husband’s thing, not mine. Then she started accusing me of being selfish and wanting to talk to her and see her. Said she had dealt with selfishness all her life and wasn’t dealing with it with me. Said if I truly loved her that I would give her the time she needed to work on her problems and be supportive of her.  
Just today I asked her how I can be more supportive and be there for her. Her reply, “I don’t need things or people in my life that make it harder or more upsetting. I have to get through each day as peacefully as I can.”  
I have also had my downside so not saying I am a victim or anything. She has caught me going through her phone and looking at her messages. There have been several instances of me asking about her relationship with her husband. One day when we lived together he pulled up in the driveway and I watched from the window and saw him kiss her on the forehead and confronted her about that upsetting her very badly. I am being treated and in counseling for codependency.  
I am at a loss as to what to do. She says she loves me and I do love her but I don’t feel wanted in her life. When I try to walk away I am told I am selfish. I get that she is going through some stuff and I want to be supportive of her but this is pure hell for me. When I don’t talk to her I get very anxious and depressed but when I do talk to her I feel like I have to tip m-toe around everything to keep from making her mad. Really at a loss. I have never felt like this about anyone in my life. I don’t think the current situation is good for either of us but I am afraid if we take a break I will lose her but on the other hand I feel like our only chance is to take a break and work through our own stuff together. What should I do?"
relationship_advice,Eccentric teen wishes to not be a loner.,"So I have NEVER been at a party, and I am 16 in high school, I don't do drugs, I'm not in any group that appreciates me for me. And I want to be able to go to a party, because I want to fix my relationship to people as a whole, and fix my relationship with myself. I have basically no social status, and just want to be out there with people, pls help. Also this is my first ever Reddit post so hello world"
relationship_advice,He told me he loves me then disappeared.,"The guy I’m dating (long distance) told me last week he loved me. At first I said how sweet, then I felt awful as I have been wanting this from him, so later that night I text him, I loved him and goodnight. The next morning he text me again he loved me too. We chatted briefly and that was that. The next day he messaged me we chatted and that was it, which was last weds. 

Monday I couldn’t take it anymore and text him I hoped he was having a good day, he replied immediately the same thing back also saying word was very busy with kissy face emojis. I replied we’d talk later then. That was it again. 

Why????? I don’t get it. I’m so nervous and worried especially since he’s supposed to come visit me in about 10 days??? We were doing great! And now I just feel like I got my hopes up for nothing."
relationship_advice,My (26F) bf (25M) flirted with another girl over text,"Long story short, I've been dating the best boy in the world for over a year. We've hardly had any trouble in our relationship, aside from his difficulty talking about his emotions. 

I stumbled upon flirtatious texts between him and an old friend who he's kissed before, where they were talking about an old kiss and he said he's glad he kissed her because it felt special. (This kiss happened years before we met)

He looked like a deer caught in headlights when I confronted him about it. When we talked about it, he said he doesn't have feelings for her and that he just felt a spark and nostalgia for the past and that he's been depressed lately and misses the old care-free college days. He denies that it has anything to do with our relationship, but he did say that he has minor doubts sometimes about our compatibility - after I kept pushing. 

I don't really know what to do. I feel extremely hurt because I never in a million years would've expected this from him. He says he loves me and realizes that what he did was wrong, and that he wants to work on things. I can't help but feel that this is a big warning sign that he's not happy with me and that this is just going to happen again/or that he's gonna realize he's not happy and it'll end soon anyway. 

I told him I need some time to think things through. I really love him and I've been heartbroken all day not talking to him. I don't want to end things but I also don't want to invest my emotions in someone who would hurt me like this. 

Do you think this is salvageable?"
relationship_advice,Too many arguments/is this taking out anger on me? me(24m) and my gf(26f),"So I can't tell if this is true or not but I'm beginning to think that my GF can be guilt tripping and manipulative sometimes when shes upset in general and it's starting to get to me. But its possible that I'm just not considerate? I'm not sure.  We have been together for 4 months and the fighting started right after 3 months. 

So in the past we have fought about some stupid things, but tonight I can understand why the fighting started. For some context, my whole life I have been pretty socially awkward at times and have barely any experience with girls (a few hookups, one summer fling in high school). 

She had left her car open on accident for 15 minutes at work at a warehouse while bringing stuff in . And one of the workers(probably) stole around 100 dollars. She called me while I was at the gym and I went to the locker room. She then told me about the money being stolen. She very quickly started yelling about how the other workers there are ridiculous and she KNOWS the guy that stole it because she hates him. Now in the past, she has gotten mad at someone before that she didn't like for something they didn't do. So I just tried to tell her that maybe it wasn't this guy. Then she got an attitude with me after a bit for disagreeing with her. I was in an awkward situation since everyone could hear me and now she had an attitude at me. Then she was quiet for a few seconds and then started to say she was just upset at everything in life and wanted to cry. Because of me being genuinely confused that she was upset at me an also the awkwardness of the locker room and people hearing me, I let out a laugh. Really horrible thing for me to do :( 

We got over that in a little bit though, I apologized a lot and tried to explain without being so defensive(although i was defensive because I felt like a shitty boyfriend) and she wasn't that mad and started ventint to me again. She told me that she didn't want me to disagree with her over petty things like who stole the money or whatever and just listen. I agreed I shouldn't have put my opinions in at that point, it wasn't the right time. But apparently she took that as I should agree to everything? She went on to say ""its just 100 dollars I shouldn't be upset"" I then said ""hell, I'd be mad if I lost 100 dollars"". She got jumpy and angry really quick and it started into a fight for some reason. I tried to explain to her that I was just trying to make her feel better and validate her being so upset. She even said she gets it but she kept on texting me being pissed about me saying that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things like ""God forbid you know you go along with what I say bc you know itll make me feel better"" . and then about what I said again ""Clearly I knew and know that its a lot of money. Im trying to get over it not remind myself well you know what that is a good chunk. You being like hy, yeah things could have been wore. You could have crashed your car or died would have went differently. This is coming from a place of ME feeling disrespected. so great. We both feel disrespected. You feel better you said it a bunch? JOIN THE CLLLLLLUB""

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I see a lot of it as her being upset about the situation and taking it out on me. Am I wrong to think that? I really was trying to make her feel better :( And I feel like I have a right to be upset with her yelling at me for it. I thought it would make sense that when she realized what I meant we could drop that part?"
relationship_advice,I (20m) am in love with my friend (21f) but she’s in a relationship.,"
So I’ve known this girl for a while and we’ve always been incredibly good mates. We’re incredibly comfortable together and when we end up drinking/smoking we always end up cuddling etc.

She has a boyfriend of a year (who I introduced her too) who’s a very nice lad and I get on with reasonably well. Recently I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ve always had feelings for her and have never acted upon them. I’ve been hanging around with her a lot lately and she’s often complained about him and said she’s considering breaking up with him.

When our drinking with my best friend tonight (who is also a very good friend of hers as well) he said that he is certain that she’s always liked me and said that I should say something. He says he’s fairly certain she’ll reciprocate and if not then at least I’ll admit to her how I feel. He’s threatened that unless I tell her at a party tomorrow night then he’ll tell her  how I feel.

I don’t want to break her relationship because I think it’d be a dick move. I also really want to tell her how I feel but don’t want to loose a strong friendship.  What do you think reddit?"
relationship_advice,Me (19F) and a tinder match (19M) stopped talking after we swapped social media,"This is a little embarrassing putting this out there, but I made a tinder account for the first time out of complete boredom, met this dude whos super cute and actually funny and he's been the only match I talked to. We finally gave each other our instagram accounts (he was the one who initiated it) and the thing is, I don't have a lot of posts involving my face, maybe like two or three posts dedicated to selfies or pictures of me and my friends but I mainly use the ig story to post things about college events and my face manages to be in those shots. I've been the one who's initiated the conversation (but then again, he's usually the last one to text by the end of the day) and when I don't text him we don't talk at all. I'm wondering if I should stop putting the effort in trying to make this work because we have yet to have a conversation where we can get to know each other. Any advice?"
relationship_advice,Which is more valued: Education or Work Ethic?,"Good evening everyone. I have a question for you.

I have worked in a fast food restaurant for 9 years now, with only a high school diploma in my name. Ever since I've worked there, I've been well, nervous about money issues I would have in my future such as retirement or living areas.

And so I work and save as much as I can. I work and listen to my coworkers chat on about family, finances and I...feel bad that I can't relate because I haven't experienced the same things they have. My father has reassured me that my future living area will be taken care of, but  that's in the far future. 

I feel guilty that I never went to college because I didn't want my father to go in debt and I wasn't that good in school anyway and he felt that going into the workforce would be better.

But customers and coworkers tell me that I have a great work ethic and they hope I keep it up. 

And so I'm lost. Is a good work ethic more valued than a college education?"

relationship_advice,"Ex gf asked for space, but continues to like my posts and text my family? Help!","Hello reddit community, I’m stuck in a predicament which calls for a lot of help.

I (23) would love to mend the relationship with my ex girlfriend (22). We dated a year and a half. She broke up with me, and shortly after I asked if we could meet in person and talk about it , which she lead to “please respect my decision, I need some space”. So I’ve given her space, in fact, I’ve given her a week and 4 days with no reply. She texted my brother Friday and my mom Monday saying “happy birthday”. She kept me on all social media, including uploads pics with me. I shortly removed her from all media so I could move on. She still watches all of my Snapchat posts. I uploaded a picture onto Instagram and she liked it. I had removed her follow, which means it didnt pop up in her feed and she had to deliberately type in my account and like the photos.

So I’m confused here. If she asks for space, and I’m respecting that, why in the world is she texting my family and liking my posts and stalking my social media? Is this her trying to contact me? Does she want a reaction?

Please help

TLDR: ex gf asked for space, but continues to text family and like my social media posts"
relationship_advice,I'm (18M) worried about my gf (15F) sitting next to her ex-crush.,"Hi everyone. 

So my girlfriend and I met in one of our classes at the beginning of the school year. However, now with the new semester starting, we have new seating arrangements. And she sits next to her ex-crush. Soon before we started dating, she had been obsessed with this guy. Just bat-shit crazy about him. And when she pursued him, he led her on. And led her on. And then broke her heart. She had a complete breakdown and was throwing up all the time, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep...basically it was very traumatic. But now that she's sitting next to him, she's talking with him and having fun and flipping her hair often and making jokes and it just...it just kills me to see it happening from the other side of the room. I communicated my thoughts to her and asked her if she still has feelings, and she said no. But then I found out she told one of her friends right after that that she DID have feelings, but then kept switching back and forth with them and eventually said no. Despite my best efforts to treat her well, she seems to have way more fun talking to this douchebag who broke her heart months ago than she does with me. I would be lying if I said it didn't hurt. I told her that I would trust her and that I wouldn't control her, and that she can do what she wants. But recently, she's been super defensive when it comes to him and gets annoyed when he ends up in the conversation. Which, literally just makes me more sure that she still has feelings for him. I know that this is a serious red flag. But we're happy together. What can I do to salvage this and make it work between us? Am I overreacting? Thanks everyone. 

P.S. I get the age gap...no sex is happening whatsoever, even when she does turn 16. I'm not interested in her like that. Dating her is legal, and we're happy together."

We were at our friends house and all of us watching a movie and eating ice cream and she was going crazy on her ice cream.

It was awkward so i told her to cut it out because we were with friends and i dont want them to see her giving her ice cream cone a blow job. Then she ignored me and wouldn’t stop and then i got mad so i asked her again and she yelled at me and told me to leave her alone.

relationship_advice,"I (18/M) am struggling with a relationship with my ex (19/F), would love some advice!","Howdy y'all. First time redditor, so bear with me \^\~\^ I've been having a lot of trouble lately with my most recent relationship. We've been apart for just over 2 months now and it's not getting any easier, and I'd love to hear from you all what I should say/do. 

\-=+=-

***TL;DR I'm emotionally committed to my ex-girlfriend and she's not making things easy on me morally or emotionally and I've lost sight of what it is I need to do. (***[***This song***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Saltrw8V3UI) ***really does everything justice, as does*** [***this one***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7-n-D2HhA) ***to an extent.)***

\-=+=-

We started dating towards the end of our senior year in high school, and we caught on very quickly. 3 days after really meeting each other and we're making out. I take her to prom. A month I met her we started dating. We spent most of the summer apart (she was a Spanish major and took a trip abroad to Spain, while I was doing family vacations and things of that nature back stateside). The first day we're both home, we go out (I couldn't drive at the time so she drove us everywhere while I played music) and when we get back to my house we (*very* carefully) choose to have sex in the backseat of her car. Fast forward a month or two, she moves 2 hours away to college. I'm doing an online program for college, so I can pretty much be anywhere anytime so long as I'm keeping up with my work. So about a month or so into college (it's about October or so,)  we get to talking on the phone and we kind of realize we're oddly very different people. I know exactly who I am and what I want to do with my life, and I have a fairly decent plan on getting there. She, however, has changed her major to Political Science and has 0 clue really who she is or what she wants to do with her life. It's now late November, and I get a text saying she wants to talk to me. My heart sinks. She calls me on the phone and tells me that she wants to break up, out of the blue. She told me she was just stressed and tired and just needed a minute, that I was still going to be a part of her life, just not her boyfriend anymore. I respected that and moved forward. 

We still talk, and we've seen each other since we broke up, and every time we see each other we kiss. Whether it was my doing or hers, it seems like neither of us can help it. The last time I saw her, I asked her how she feels. She tells me she still loves me, and the only thing that's changed between us is the label of our relationship, and we're allowed to see other people if we so choose. We almost had sex in the back of *my* car (I've since gotten my license, a car, and a job,) but I politely refused due to the fact that 1) My car is tiny as shit 2) We're in broad daylight at 12:00 in the afternoon 3) Literally anyone in their right mind could've rolled up on us (that was my big fear along with #2, in hindsight really sad I didn't make that clear). Don't get me wrong, I would've jumped at that opportunity in a heartbeat, I'd much rather though do that shit proper. 

On top of that, I've met someone at work who *really* likes me (it's honestly really cute), but I don't *love* her, and I feel like I'm cheating on my ex-girlfriend for whatever reason because I still have feelings for her, even though we're not dating anymore. I think she's really sweet, and she's super gentle, but she's just too shy and not quite my energy, yet I still want to get together and watch movies and cuddle and give her little baby smooches on the forehead. She just screams *\*c u t e\** but isn't great for me in the long run. 

I take my relationships wickedly serious. I'm all but 18 but I think about more than just them when I have feelings, I think about their family, how I'd call them mine when we get married and vice versa, how we're actually going to get married, being the father of our children, and so on and so forth. What I'm trying to get at is that my ex-girlfriend is special. I love her family (and her family tolerates me I'm pretty sure,) I'd love to be her husband, it'd be a dream come true if I could be the father of her kids, but seemingly she doesn't want any of that. Her words are telling me no, but her actions are telling me yes, and it's killing me slowly, it's like I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. Maybe it's love, or maybe I need to take a hint, or we just need to communicate better, whatever it is, I'd love to hear what I should do."
relationship_advice,I found out my boyfriend (18M) is still talking to a girl he briefly dated over a year ago. Not sure if I should be concerned. (Please read description),"The context: my boyfriend and I are newly dating (approx 2 months). Everything is going great so far. The other night we were hanging out with his friends and he left to go buy everyone some food. While he was gone, his friend and I started talking and he told me all about my bf’s dating history (which i already knew). He told me about this girl (lets call her Sarah). They went on a couple dates a little over a year ago, but it never worked out because she wasn’t into him as much as he was into her. Apparently he was head over heels for her and put in alot of effort. This is all i know about her, i have no idea if they are still friends or anything. All i know is her name and that they went on a couple dates. 

So today, i was hanging out with my bf and he was chilling on his phone when all of a sudden a text message from her popped up. I was alarmed because I didn’t know they still talked. He opened the text in front of me and they were talking about something school related. (We go to a huge university, i had no idea she went there too). He was texting back and forth with her in front of me with no problem, which I guess is a good sign, but I just dont know how to feel about him talking to her being that they went out at some point and he had a huge crush on her. I know my jealousy is getting the best of me but its bothering me. 

Is this something i should bring up with him or am I overreacting? Should i let it slide ?"
relationship_advice,I'm(19F) considering trying out casual sex with my best friend's ex(19M),"I'm so embarrassed to write this out, but he suggested it last night after some flirting back and forth and I told him I thought it would be irresponsible. My best friend broke up with him and said she lost her interest in him a while ago and she doesn't want anything to do with him anymore. They don't speak anymore, but I've stayed friends with him and he occasionally mentions how he misses her and is trying to get over her. We've started talking a fair bit and I find him really sweet. 

Last night things got a little heated over text and he suddenly asked me what I think of him and if I would be interested in having sex with him, no strings attached. I feel bad for even wanting to, but considering they aren't in contact, I thought it would be okay, or is it not? He makes me feel safe and really knows me. He asked me to come and watch a movie at his place and I agreed. 

tl;dr my best friend's ex boyfriend (who i am now close with and has no contact with my best friend because she somewhat dislikes him) asked me to his place and then asked to hook up and i'm considering it. Is this a total dick move? I don't want to hurt anyone."
relationship_advice,Emotions have been fleeting for me...,"(Both of us are F21)

So I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for a little over a year now and things were going great for a while but lately for me, things have been starting to take a turn. 

Now my girlfriend and I have only had one major fight, the rest have been smaller arguments about the same things over and over again. She prides herself on being good with communication and healthy relationship building, but as I said, the same things keep getting brought up and it is getting downright exhausting for me emotionally. 

The two biggest things that bother me are her huge mood swings, constant complaining about mundane things, and clinginess/needy tendencies towards me. I have expressed my feelings about the mood swings and how they have a negative effect on my mental health and she apologized, swearing she was gonna work on it. Admittedly, she had slightly improved on that aspect but there are still moments where she gets into bad moods for minor reasons and the whole day is ruined because of it. 

The second issue I have not mentioned to her because I know how much it would hurt her to hear. We only see each other Monday-Thursday (we both attend the same college, so we only see each other on the days we are both on campus. Not on weekends because of work) but we spend upwards of 5 uninterrupted hours together for a few of those days. During that time, she needs reassuring and constant attention. One example being if my hands are full and can’t hold her hand, she will try and wrap her arm around my arm even when I’m preoccupied for that short span of time. She also says things like “I am obsessed with you” and talks about how she sees us being married and living together (even though we are both only 21 years old and still in college, and I’ve expressed how I am not one for marriage).

After we are done spending the day together, it takes a while just to say goodbye. She acts like we aren’t gonna see each other the next day or following Monday. Then when we aren’t together, we are in constant contact via messaging and she is always complaining about something whether it be how she misses me, drama in her family or friend group, something about school, or something else. 

Does it make me a bad significant other to say all of this makes me feel exhausted and overwhelmed ? Is this relationship still worth holding on to? I know ending things would break her heart, but is it time to move on?"
relationship_advice,I just divided my family in half and idk wtf to say,"So this is happening at the moment. A little backstory:

I have two aunts and one uncle(he’s dead)  and then there’s my mother.

So my one aunt L, she went to jail about half a decade ago in a huge meth ring bust and because she had children and a bad heart they put her on house arrest. She’s violated parole multiple times. Our family is highly dysfunctional.


Tonight my cousin called my grandma screaming and crying saying that CPS is at my aunts house is gonna take the kids.

So naturally everyone ended up getting called and then my aunt L called my grandma and put having her on speaker phone. My aunt L was giving my grandma’s info to the CPS worker and my grandma lost her shit and told her no. She said absolutely not she doesn’t want to be involved. My aunt hung up on her and then a few minutes later my mom called her.

My mom called and told her that they just want to inspect my grandma’s home and make sure it’s safe for the kids. My grandma doubled down and said absolutely not, because  she had to deal with COS twice with my mother. Once when my baby bro was born because she had weed in her system and once somewhat recently when my little sister broke her arm at my grandmas house. She broke her arm but she didnt know it was actually hurt because my little sister is overly dramatic. When my sister woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and crying she took her to the emergency room and CPS asked her why she took so long and my grandma took offense to it.

Then my other aunt called and balled her out. She told her to just take them for tonight and she would drive all the way from Arizona and come and get them and when my grandma doubled down even more saying no my aunt kinda lost it and was screaming and crying and saying to just take them. She still said no and my aunt said that she’s doing her grandchildren wrong and she shouldn’t care about one cps worker being “rude” if it means her grandchildren going to state.

Iagreed with my aunt and told my grandma that it’s absolutely fucked up she cares more about being “embarrassed” by a CPS worker asking questions they’re supposed to, that she’s going to let her grandchildren go to the state.

My grandma started yelling at me and telling me to mind my business and stay in a kids place (I’m an adult) and telling me and she doesn’t care she’s not doing it. I get there ya her choice but she’s letting three children go to state over them asking questions.


Now I’m getting bitched at by BOTH of my grandparents for saying something and I don’t feel like I’m wrong here?? These are my cousins too and I grew up with them. I was the one who babysat them all the time. 

I haven’t talked to my mom yet and don’t plan on it but I’m just so fucking confused. Half my family is divided right now, half are in support of me saying and the other half are bitching me out for even talking.

I don’t know anymore I hate this family. I don’t know what I could potentially say for my grandma to think straight... I can’t believe she’s really letting my cousins go to state when my aunt said she would come and get them."
relationship_advice,What do I (39/f) do about my unemployed and disabled girlfriend (37/f)?,"My girlfriend has been diagnosed with depression. She up and quit her job over a year ago without telling her ahead of time, leaving me as the sole breadwinner. Not what I signed up for. She was denied for social security disability and the first appeal last Summer. 

We got an attorney at around the same time. The attorney purposefully wanted us to not fight the first appeal because ""only 9% of people get approved at that step"" so can get to the second appeal ASAP. Which is in front of an administrative law judge. The attorney (obviously) believes it likely my girlfriend will win because she only charges if my girlfriend wins her disability case. If one receives disability from social security you get back pay from when you became disabled. 

At the same time I'm getting really frustrated and resentful here. Still no word on when we'll hear about appearing before the administrative law judge other than the attorney wayyyy back in Summer saying ""probably this coming Summer or Fall"" (2020). Meanwhile, my girlfriend still isn't working (at all) and her medical treatments with both the psychiatrist and the psychologist aren't seeming to work much. The psychologist is doing better; the psychiatrist is so bad she is going to switch to a different one. The meds she's been given so far have either done nothing at all or done nothing other than giving her side effects. 

It's taken a toll on me being the sole breadwinner. I've pretty much always earned more than her (me about $80k, her about $35k). That's fine. I've usually paid the bulk of the bills (I do the majority and property tax).. she does the groceries, utilities, and internet. Most of the time when we get stuff like fast food I buy, though sometimes she did too. But now I'm not only pulling 51% of the weight, I'm pulling all the weight. And I don't like it. It's not fair. My girlfriend knows that I hate work. Yes - hate work. Not my job. Work in general. I'm 39 and I've been aggressively saving money since I was 30 and was hoping to retire in 5 years or so. Not on some extravagant salary mind you, but just retire and live off the money in my various retirement accounts (IRA etc). Yet she quit and left me in a bind. Now every day she doesn't work is a day I'm going to have to. 

I'm especially worried if she doesn't get approved for SSDI. What do I do? Make her hold a cardboard sign and beg? Wash cars, mow lawns, walk dogs, and shovel snow? Even to just bring a little bit of cash in if she can't work a full time job? Leave? I scrimped and saved. I didn't live an extravagant lifetime. I saved most of my money so I could quit. Now I'm not going to be able to. What the hell do I do?"
relationship_advice,How do I fix my mistakes to fix my relationship,"I [21f] have royally screwed up with my fiancé [21m]. So I am on mobile sorry if this doesn’t look good. I’ve only been with one person in any way sexually, same with my fiancé. Recently my fiancé wants nothing to do with me and wants to end our relationship. last weekend he ditched me to go out with friends in the sand dunes near our house (we live together) I was very upset at the time due to  wanting him to meet my great grandpa who was in the hospital. During this  time I ended up calling him and telling him in a threatening tone to watch out for police. Going into the sand dunes is illegal as it’s private property. Little did I know police did show up after I had called him. He thinks I called the police on him because I was very mad and upset. Now adding to that I already have a bad time following through with what I say I will do.  I have PCOS so I need to lose weight and I just never go to the gym and work out. I tell him I will but I end up not doing it. Things like that add strain to the relationship. Now that he wants to be done 100% due to the cop situation I really want to fix myself and my relationship because i do love him. He is my one and only and I don’t want to give up hope. I have til the end of June when lease is over to make things better but he doesn’t seem to care. He even said he will move out and continue to pay rent. I really don’t know what to do at this point. All advice is welcome."
relationship_advice,I (M19) cheated on my Gf (f18),"I cheated on my girlfriend of nearly a year at a party a few days ago. I had been at a small concert with a couple of friends from a nearby college, then went to a bar, and then to a small house party after that. People had been drinking for hours, and at one point in the night people started to get ‘casually naked’. As things progressed, and people started passing out/falling asleep I ended up cuddling and watching a film with a girl who I had met once before until around 5 am. We hooked up that night (morning?), and again when we woke up an hour or two later, at which point I didn’t have any booze left in me.

So I really fucked up. Texted my girlfriend, told her we needed to talk, and around 4pm that day we met up, I said I cheated on her, and she broke up with me.

I realize what I did was awful. I apologized to her how I could, and while there is a temptation to text her again and say it again I haven’t. Probably wouldn’t be healthy for either of us to be in contact so soon after. At this point it feels like isn’t much I can do but process it and move on, but I can’t help but wonder what I should do, and how I should be feeling?

I didn’t regret the act of cheating much at all in the moment, there was only a little anxiety and a sense that it was wrong. It took until I got home and sat down for a few hours before I felt anything significant. And while I did feel horribly guilty at the end, I don’t know if that was an under reaction? I genuinely thought that I loved her (which is prob wrong, given I cheated on her), and she was my first long term relationship. Was the guilt just from hurting an emotional rock in my life who I happened to make out with? Or a sort of shame that I betrayed someone? Maybe even just having lost a good friend in such a bad way, and most definitely alienated others?

And what’s appropriate from this point forward? Is there a way I should process this and move forward? Because I don’t feel proportionally sad to how much I thought I cared about her. Is there a way I can make sure that I, as thoroughly as possible, work through how I feel about this? And at what point should I move on?

Myself aside, is there anything I can do for her past this point? I was her first relationship, first time she even held hands romantically. And, if nothing else, I know I regret hurting her. Is there some way I can help ease this for her? Or is it best to just completely let go, give her space and realize that I did something horrible and consequences tend to last for a while, regardless of who faces them.

TLDR: I’m a piece of shit who cheated on his girlfriend of a year, and after telling her + breaking up I’m wondering what I should do now, both in reference to her and myself."
relationship_advice,[15 F] unsure about my gf [17 F],"Ill preface this with that this is my first relationship in like 3 years and I generally don't get along with people. 
She's very sweet I think she's funny and beautiful and I appreciate her a lot, but a few things have made me uneasy. 

She's said a couple of offensive things that I tried to bring up but she brushed me off 

She's very affectionate with her friends (which isn't a problem) but goes a little far by saying she would ""date you so fast"" and ""good thing that [friends gf] doesn't watch my story because she'd be so mad at you""

She doesn't want to be affectionate with me in public. She'll text me all day about how she wants to cuddle and kiss me and hold my hand but every time i hold her hand she finds an excuse to drop it. She doesn't like calling me pet names in front of people but she's yelled to her guy friends that they have a nice ass(I'm trying to say she's not exactly shy) 

All our conversations have been awkward and dry since things got slightly more serious 
If anyone has advice on how to approach these topics or if they seem like red flags itd be very appreciated 
Thank you."

Ex knows about bf and approved because he treats me well, and our kids. Bf visits and helps me with money to support them. Okay so I have no friends because they have all moved away, and I just don’t want to make new ones when I’m moving in a month. I’m literally confined to my house (ex has the car mine is in the shop). I don’t work again moving. My only other human interaction is my bf we are always on the phone, we sleep on the phone etc. I always tell him he doesn’t need to talk to me when he’s free if he wants to be alone I’m okay. I’ve been very depressed lately, I don’t even know what’s wrong with me I just have no motivation I feel so blah. I have no energy no will nothing. I have been telling him this. I always ask him “are you sure you don’t have to talk to me if you don’t want you sent obligated”. He thinks it’s because I have no interaction and am just by myself 24/7 tending to children. It’s finally taking a toll on me having no adults in person. He believes it will change once I move out with him next month and can work, go back to school have an identity. But lately he’s been disappearing on me. The last week it would be a fee hours from 4pm-7pm. He’d tell me “spending time with family since I won’t be once we are together. Which I’m 100% for. Today he was suppose to call me back this morning or afternoon he hasn’t and it’s been 12 hours, that’s very very unusual. He messages me to tell me he’s cooking and drunk that was 3 hours ago, I tell him “okay, have fun!” Usually he will always read and text back. But I just have this feeling that I’m honestly exhausting him with how just low and just down I’ve been. So I know it’s me, and he’s probably just needing a break. My question is should I step back as well? And how so? Should I also just distance myself?

Additional information: He’s also in the middle of buying a house to accommodate my children and me. I will have 45/55 custody. My ex (their father is active in their lives and I refuse to deny my children that)"
relationship_advice,First date,"So, I asked a girl I like on a date for valentines day. Kind of random, but what food is good for this kind of thing?"
relationship_advice,Fighting with parents and don't quite know who is wrong (17M/OK),"I am a 18yo male who has Asperger's and is attending college and am swamped with stuff. I also tend to be forgetful. I am working on it however and I'd say I am making progress in remembering stuff. Earlier I forgot a blanket in the wash. Not really a big deal. She told me, I apologized and went to correct it. She then accused me of ""not caring"". That is a very hurtful accusation, I bit back a little bit. She immediately went to a 10. She blew up. I tried to separate myself but she can't stop berating me. So I snap back and say something along the lines of ""didn't you forget it too?"" I felt so disrespected and degraded. She normally is great (amazing) but sometimes she disrespects me by making accusations like this. She knows how offensive that is to me. I'm honestly getting tired of this. I think she is emotionally manipulative. I need help. Any questions/comments?"
relationship_advice,I feel lonely with my husband,"Basically what the title says... I'm on mobile blah blah blah. 



My husband and I have been together for 6 years. We got married in October 2019 and I constantly feel lonely with him. And without him. 

I dont know if it's him or me but when I'm with my husband; whether one on one or surrounded by people, I feel lonely. 

I recently left for a trip with a couple girlfriends and the day I left, he acted like it was just another day. Like I wasnt going to be gone for a week plus. He's on his phone when he gets home from work, scrolling through facebook or whatever, while I'm trying to be like ""I leave today and want to spend quality time with you."" 

Being in contact while seperated is HUGE for me. Texting, calling, Facetime, whatever is important to me. He struggles to text me through an average day, let alone days when we wont see each other at all (we work different shifts). 

I don't know how else to bring up this feeling of loneliness to him without being a hen pecking wife. Are we incompatible or just... lacking something? I've told him how I feel and expressed that's how I feel love but.. It's still something he doesnt do/express/care about/whatever... 

Tell me if I'm being codependent or if its reasonable to expect contact through days I'm not seeing my husband."
relationship_advice,I (20M) have a gf(19F) with attachment and hygiene issues. What do I do about it?,"We have have been dating for about a year most of that time has been pretty good. However, in October things started to get bad. She slowly began to resent my friends because they weren’t her friends too. She called me one night when I was with some friends and she asked me to stay with her because she said she was having suicidal thoughts. She will say she is fine with me taking time for my friends but then also complains about how she isn’t included. She will interrupt a conversation I’m having to make me hug her and tell her I love her. 

This is combined with her steadily declining hygiene as she takes showers only a few times a week and rarely wears deodorant or perfume. On top of this she dyed her hair and cut it pretty short. I frequently notice her hair getting thinner and thinner and have found a lot of her hair in the house that I’m staying in. The worst of all is that she often has terrible breath and she expects me to kiss her often. 

I do care about her a lot but I don’t know how to overcome these issues. Any advice would be welcome."
relationship_advice,My girlfriend (15F) keeps telling me (17M) that she loves this guy and thinks that he is hot as a joke.,"So this started ever since she noticed this guy who I am good friends with. She told me that he was cute and since that day, she keeps telling me the same thing over and over. She keeps saying that she doesn’t like him at all and just wants me to be jealous because she likes it, but I’ve caught her staring at him for long periods of time. Today she asked me how old is he and when was his birthday. I asked her “Why?” and she just replied “Just”. She notices things on the guy I didn’t even know about. Then there are times where she goes way overboard and starts saying she would do all these sexual things to him. I’ve never experienced this. Is this normal? What are y’all thoughts?"
relationship_advice,Strong initial connection with bumble date but now distant before nice double date. What should I do?,"I (24m) had a really strong connection on bumble with this one girl (24f). We went on a first date that went really well, we got food and drinks, then went to an arcade and played some VR games. I felt a strong connection and felt comfortable with a nice second date.

She was enthusiastic about a second date and even got involved in planning. My friend and his wife were going to a nice standup comedy event so I bough two tickets next to them and we planned a whole evening for the 4 of us.

This was a week out and our date is now in two days. I’ve noticed that our texting has become infrequent and a lot shorter than our conversations initially. We’re down to a few texts a day.

So since we’re going to spend an evening at a show and a nice restaurant, should I send her a double text or something to see what’s going on? Maybe to ask her what she is using bumble for? I don’t want to go into the night thinking this is going anywhere if she’s already lost interest."
relationship_advice,Confused and heartbroken,"So a little back story I’ve been dating my bf for almost 2 years our anniversary is in February. I’ve lived with him for over a year and a half out of that. I’ve caught him cheating(not physically) just messaging other girls calling them cute behind my back and one time receiving an underwear pic from a random girl. I’ve forgiven him multiple times and each time he gained by trust back but then I would find him doing shady things again and all of that work was for nothing, a couple days ago I was using his computer and found messages dating back to three months ago, telling this girl he thinks she’s cute and that he loves her and such, I confronted him and forgave him..yet again. I’m at a loss I love him so much but I know I don’t deserve this. But if I move out I’ll be homeless with my cats. I would have no where to go and genuinely want to make it work, because I can’t imagine life without him. I need help, advice, anything I don’t know if I can be heartbroken again 😔"
relationship_advice,Did I handle this ok?,"I’ve been seeing this guy for a few months now and so far he’s been mostly great. We both got out of long term relationships last year and want to wait before we get serious. For context I’m 21f and he’s 22m.

Now him and his group of friends are kinda losers when it comes to girls, they are too insecure to put themselves out there most the time. But they’re also the type of guys that constantly objectify women when they’re together. Not my fav, but it’s tolerable.

I’ve told him that at the moment I’m very fragile and my self esteem is at a low after what I went through last year. I’ve asked him to try to keep his comments about hot women to himself when he’s around me.

Well today I asked him how physical therapy was and he told me his PT is “thick af.” So I replied and reexplained to him that it hurts my feelings when he says stuff like that around me, that my self esteem is not doing well, and I hope he cares and that I keep comments about hot men to myself around him because I know his self esteem has been suffering also.

I thought this was a fine way to handle it. I was respectful and didn’t say he COULDNT do it, simply that it hurts my feelings. Well now I’m doubting how I handled things because he read my message but has not replied. It’s been about a half hour.

Advice on how I should handle it from here? I thought it was totally reasonable for me to ask him not to make those comments around me, but I’m worried when he does reply that he’s going to be upset at me and say it’s not a big deal. Should I just let it go? 

TLDR; I asked guy I’ve been seeing not to make comments about other women’s bodies around me because my self esteem is fragile after a bad breakup last year. He did it over text and when I called him out for it he read &amp; ignored my message. Did I handle it poorly? Should I have just let it go?"
relationship_advice,"Would it be rude to, in the nicest way possible, ask one of my best friends to a +1 to her wedding?","To help, I am a guy and she is a woman.  Names are fake and chosen from top names list.

One of my best friends, Emma, is getting married in a number of months.  We have know each other for close to 20 years but have been very good and then one of each others best friends for 12 years.  I had talked to her, specifically about the wedding, in the time after she got engaged over a year ago and then when I have seen her since they started actually planning their wedding.  She told me one of those times that she and fiance were unsure whether they were going to be extending +1s to all of their guests and told me it was because they didn't know if they could afford it.  I do not know for sure that this is the real reason but have no reason to doubt it. They are getting married at a winery in CA so I don't think there is an issue with space.  

I have been dating my girlfriend, Olivia, for a year and a half and Emma has met her multiple times, my friend lives in a different city about 2 hours away from Olivia and I.  They are not best friends or anything but get along very well.  We have done things with Emma+fiance and I, me+Olivia and Emma, and Emma+fiance and me+Olivia and have had a good time on every different occasion and have things planned for late spring and early summer with the 4 of us.

Emma has met one other long term (3+ years) girlfriend of mine who I broke up with 5 years ago and has helped me through some other serious things in my life, as I have her.  I know her parents and she knows mine.  This is the first woman I've dated since in which I feel our relationship has progressed into a very real and serious and I would very much like to have Olivia there to celebrate Emma and her fiance's marriage and have her be a bigger part of my life.

So my big question is, would it be rude for me to ask Emma it would be possible for my girlfriend to attend her wedding if I helped cover the extra cost?  Emma is not someone who will get angry at me, if anything she would be frustrated but probably feel a little guilty about not having extended me a guest invite which I don't want to cause her to feel that but it would mean so much for me to have Olivia there.  

I have been thinking about this for some time and in my head have something like this... 

""Emma, I'm so happy for you and fiance and can't wait to be there at your wedding.  I wanted to ask you something and I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or that I'm upset about this.  I know you and fiance were struggling with whether or not to extend plus ones to people and I completely understand if this is not possible.  I was wondering if it could be arranged for Olivia to come to your wedding with me?  I would be very happy to offset the added cost of having her attend.  She is a big part of my life and I would love to have her there to celebrate you and Mark.  I hope it wasn't selfish of me to ask and again I completely understand if it can't happen and I won't be upset in the slightest.""

If it rude? If not, is what I have above good?  I am unsure of whether there's a better way to say I'd happily cover the extra money that it would be for Olivia to come and am considering adding something more about Olivia being important to me or such but again, don't want to make Emma feel guilty."

relationship_advice,How can I (26M) can cope and learn to not feel emotional when my partner (26F) doesn't want to talk to me for hours to a day?,"My partner (26F) and I (26M) have been dating for 6 months now and for the first 4 months we would talk otp or text each other constantly throughout the day. We both loved it and enjoyed it, but recently for the past 2 months my partner hasn't been wanting to text or call as much. The amount we talk is a dramatic change. She claims that we are good in the relationship, but she just wants personal space. When we are in person I feel loved and wanted, but through the phone I don't feel it as much. When we don't text I feel unwanted, unloved and hurt. I'm here asking how can I stop from feeling this way and learn to respect her needs and wants?"
relationship_advice,My truth vs his assumptions.,"How do I get my boyfriend to stop assuming my emotions.

Tonight we were on the phone and he thought I was walking my dogs when I had just told him I was throwing my trash out and I replied no why would I be walking my dogs rn I don't wanna get mugged (I live in a bad area and I said this in a calm manner almost annoyed because it's a stupid question imo) and he proceeded to tell me ok jeez don't need to get upset and I'm just like..... I'm not upset I did not say I was upset why do you always assume everything all the time (he does this in person too and often) if I were upset I would tell him and I got truly upset at the fact that he was assuming that I was upset and he used that as ""see you're upset"" and it's like.... Initially I wasn't upset you've made me upset with you time and time again assuming my feelings. He hung up on me which is real fresh considering he preaches about communicating and has told me to never hang up on him.

How do I avoid this?"

relationship_advice,I f*cked up. Where to go from here,"So I (21F) was fresh out of a relationship and had a thing for this guy for quite some time.

The only issue is, the guy (30M) was my boss. I wasn’t obvious with my feelings but I’m assuming he still could see right through me, and he began pursuing me. I was beaming with excitement. 
It started really innocent, just some coffee dates, hour long phone calls, but then we started sleeping together.  I didn’t listen to people telling me it was a bad idea to date a coworker. Eventually we started secretly dating.
Since that time I’ve been promoted at my job, so he’s not technically my superior anymore. This would’ve given us the chance to not have to be discreet about our relationship, but I guess he preferred me to be a secret.
After about two months I had this gut feeling there was a reason he wanted me so hush hush. (There was someone else in his life, probably.) I finally got fed up and told him how I was feeling. That I didn’t like feeling like his dirty little secret, I wanted to be his equal, and I wanted to be treated like his girlfriend and not some girl he invited over once a week when he wanted sex. We hadn’t gone on a single date since officiating the relationship. Had only hung out maybe twice. He also started just kind of treating me like a piece of meat. I remained civil when expressing my concerns. 
He got defensive and broke things off. I told him the age gap and the fact I was his subordinate for a while made things hard for me and made me feel vulnerable, but he just didn’t care. We couldn’t salvage things and it ended on a bad note.
We haven’t spoken since then. This was a month ago. I don’t have any intentions of contacting HR, even though I know his actions were predatory. I still feel in the wrong for consenting to the relationship. And I don’t want to bring light to it in the workplace, in fear that it’ll effect both of our professional reputations.
But work has become unbearable. And I’m just not sure what I would even say to him. I want to quit so badly, but I have another promotion on the way. (Not because of the fact I slept with a superior, that has no correlation lmao. None of our coworkers, let alone our bosses know what happened between us.)

My feelings for him have dissipated, and I’m not looking to rekindle our relationship. I just don’t want things to be so awkward any more. I can’t even go to him for work related tasks. I can barely even look at him, let alone be in the same room as him without someone there as social relief.  The whole situation just makes me feel sick. I feel used.

What do I do? What would I say to him? Is it wrong of me to expect him to be the one to try to fix things? He started this mess. Should I just find a new job? Yikes"
relationship_advice,Dating someone who’s adopted,"I’m 19F my bf is 24M we’ve been dating for 8 months. My bf is black and white not entirely sure because he hasn’t met his real parents ever. His adoptive parents are both WHITE and live is some racist lil town in Connecticut. He’s told me plenty of times he didn’t feel like he belonged in the family growing up, how he got bullied in majority white schools, and how he even struggled with depression for years and tried to commit suicide. Personally I think white people should not adopt black kids because they cannot relate to them or really understand what we go through. I sometimes wonder if they adopted two black kids to makes themselves feel like good allies. Their first solution to everything is therapy n antidepressants but he’s tried it before and said that antidepressant were making him alter his perception of reality. When we first started dating he masked his depression so well n so did I. Once I found a letter of his ex in his room that’s when the spiral of problems began and he opened up about his depression. I found many things of his two past ex’s throughout his room and it’s caused fights many times. He got rid of majority of the shit cause he saw I was upset but I would still find little things of theirs around and it would make me lividddd. I still feel like he loves them even the one who was his abuser. He’s had so many pictures of them both on his phone at the top. and I’ve asked for him to delete them if he wasnt holding onto the memories he said he deleted it, but lied,  I went on his phone like the crazy cancer I am and found them still there. I’ve always struggled with my own insecurities and trust issues and fear of abandonment, but this shit with his ex’s is hard for me to understand cause I know he hasn’t healed or moved on from either of those relationships. Ever since I found that letter from his ex in his drawer over the summer it triggered tf out of me and just brought back all those feelings of doubt and disappointment when my ex’s betrayed me and I haven’t been able to fully trust him since then. And I’ve just been getting angry at everything that seems like it could possibly mean he’s fucking me over WHICH IS JUST A NEGATIVE WAY TO LIVE AND THINK. What is a relationship without trust right? We’ve both been burned and just want to love on each other but it’s not going to come easy I know :( we both have to heal internally and face the fears we don’t want to in order to love each other unconditionally. I’m a black woman and my bf passes more for his white side than black side and it’s really hard for me to relate to or see him as a black man. Even though I’m Afro Latina and we’re both considered mixed :/ I know it’s not fair cause he doesn’t know his full ethnicity n shit either so I know he struggles with how he identifies himself too. But he  grew up with a wealthy family and they have given a lot to him n still do help out with a lot of shit he’s says he’s aware of his privilege but sometimes I feel like he isn’t rlly aware and doesn’t utilize it in a way to help himself or our community which is kinda sad. He doesn’t want to go through the journey of understanding his depression and how to live a healthy life. And he def doesn’t want to face childhood trauma or how he feels about his tea mom. When we get into arguments he’ll says things like I’m not gunna live for much longer anyway or I wish I had the courage to kill myself and I be sacred af when he says that stuff. Sometimes things get violent too and it’s just really hard to see him get so angry and go through all of this.I want us both to be the most healthy happy versions of ourselves. I feel like I’ve picked up on a lot of his behavior and traits and also the dynamics of my parental relationships and it’s just been very unhealthy for me and my relationship. I’m blabbering but I don’t talk about this in detail with anyone who would rlly listen so it feels good to let it out"
relationship_advice,I (M29) having an argument with wife (F28) over some stuff and it seems to escalate into talking of divorce,"I'm not sure how to put into context what's happened so I'll try to explain the situation.  
I struggled with alcoholism for a long time and it wrecked my self-esteem, not being able to get through school or get and keep a job. I found Naltrexone 3 years ago or so that's really helped me curb the drinking and since then I have been doing great.  
I started dating my wife soon after I started the medication. I had only been on it for a few months. She was very overweight. I met her on ok\_cupid. At the time I continued to date her because she seemed nice and I was very lonely. I was upset over my weight but where I was like 40lbs overweight she is at least 100lbs. Still, I always assumed she would leave me because that's how most of my dating had been but she kept dating me.  
After about a year into the relationship, we went to the beach and I didn't like how people were treating me when I was with her. I also didn't like how she was acting. I had gained 10lbs and I didn't like that. I tried to break up with her but then later I had gotten drunk on soda and rum, got blackout and I broke my hand punching a door.  I was in school. People weren't sympathetic to me breaking my hand drunk and seemed angry at me over the drama. I was very hurt. I decided to go back to dating her but I wasn't happy. I truly just wanted to support while I was going through school again.  
Well, she's also an immigrant from brazil. She works as a nanny. She saw her friend get married and get his work permit to stay and she wanted to get married. I agreed. Since then she tries to tell me she married for love or she starts an argument with why would I marry someone if it wasn't for ""love"". I kinda don't know, I thought maybe I didn't think it was fair for me to use her for support and then dump her when she would have to leave because the work visa or whatever was expired.  
Anyways, since even then, less than a year, I've gained another 30lbs. I've been reasonable that with school stress I'd sacrifice some of my physical health by gaining weight. Also, my drinking continues to decrease and now I seem to drink once every other week, even though it's still a binge. I'll drink when something upsets me to cope.  
Recently she's been pressuring me into moving out of my mom's house. As much as I want to I want the money and work permits straight first. My mother is a very cruel and manipulative woman. She's narcissistic and toxic. My mother has tried to tell me my wife is the best thing that's ever happened to me and that she's gorgeous but I don't feel that way. I think my mother is just being cold and truly doesn't care. I blame her for a lot.   
My wife says she'll have saved the money by March. She wants me to go back to university. She has spoken about getting bariatric surgery. For her weight. At school, I've done well enough to get a job as a tutor.   
What's been bothering me is this isn't the marriage I wanted. I've felt pressured into this. I don't feel validated about that. I'm also upset with my wife's weight. When I see girls who look relatively fit at school and then I see my wife it makes me sad. I got overwhelmed yesterday and asked her to get the surgery sooner. She took it that I wanted to go fuck someone else. I said I don't think I can emotionally handle going back to university with all those girls and come home to her being grossly overweight. She got pretty angry about that. I had come home and cried about it and feeling stuck like this and she asked me why do I always hurt her instead. She kept trying to make it about her and I just wanted my feelings validated. Then she started suggesting a divorce after she got her work permit.   
Honestly, if she weren't an immigrant I wouldn't have agreed to marry. I've been trying to be patient about her weight and we try to diet together. I know it's hard, and having a passed alcohol problem that ruined my confidence and made people not want to deal with me made me more understanding. But it also hurts, and I've been getting progressively better since I found the medication and I feel like if people were more supportive around the time I tried to break up with her we'd all be better off right now. Maybe she would have found someone that didn't mind her weight as much, and maybe I could have found someone way less complicated to deal with.  
I'm not expecting an easy answer. Being married makes it harder because currently I don't even know how to divorce or get annulled and I don't have the money. I have to wait for student loans."

relationship_advice,ThrowRA ; Struggling to keep a friendship I want to keep.,"Hey everyone, this is just about some little high school relationship so I honestly don't blame you if you don't want to waste your time reading this haha. I'm a senior in highschool this year and will be graduating very soon, but this story takes place at the beginning of my junior year around the time of homecoming (October).

Be me, a junior on the cross country team who has never really been in a relationship before or anything just going about my day normally. When I get home there is a Snapchat notification from this girl who I kinda know but not really. She sent me this thing about how she really wanted a homecoming date and wanted to know if I would go with her. Wow, I had never really been asked to a school dance before. Honestly, the girl wasn't really my type personality wise, but I still told her yes because I felt bad that she didn't have a date. Unfortunately, I immediately regretted my decision and didn't want to go with her. I told my best friend about it and I explained I really need to find a way out. He told me that there was this foreign exchange girl named ""M"" who really wanted a homecoming date. I thought she was kinda pretty, so I decided to go for it. I told my current date that I wanted to take ""M"" so she could have the hoco experience on her exchange year. (Don't worry, I hooked the current date I had with somebody else so she didn't have to go alone.)

I end up asking ""M"" to homecoming and she said yes! However, when the day of the dance came we didn't talk or dance together at all. She was super shy and the only thing we did together was get pictures. A couple months go by, and the only time I really ever talked to ""M"" was just in the hallways or in art class, usually just messing around with her and stuff. The month is now February and I talked to ""M"" about joining the track team. She got really excited and joined. One day after practice my friends and I all went to McDonald's to get some fine cuisine. As your average high-schooler, I took a picture of my friends at McDonald's and threw it onto my Snapchat story. ""M"" responded, ""thanks for the invite"" sarcastically because I didn't invite her. After she said this, I invited her to eat with me everyday after practice, usually without my friends. At first she didn't want me to because her house was super far away from the school and she didn't want me to have to drive her, but it turns out, I lived further from the school and her house was on the way to mine.

Once ""M"" and I started hanging out more we started messaging each other a lot after school and stuff. Basically any time we weren't together we were messaging each other. I also found myself leaving my friends to walk with her in the hallway. This actually kinda caused issues with my friends but that story is for another time. Then, one night our friendship changed for good. We were both having a pretty emotional night or something I guess, but basically we were asking each other about our personal lives and stuff, and we really opened up to each other and connected. She told me about her dad dying when she was 10 and stuff, I told her about my dad becoming an alcoholic when I was a kid, and we just had a super nice conversation about everything that night. After that night, her and I were like best friends.

We had so much fun together everyday and she just became a part of my everyday life. She celebrated my mom's birthday with me and stuff, it was like she was a part of the family. I asked her to prom and she said yes, everything was going great for our friendship. Prom was on May 4th, 2019. We had a lot more fun at Prom than what we did at homecoming, it was just an amazing night. After I dropped her off, I was driving the rest of the way to my house, and I realized something... I'm mad in love with this girl. This is the last thing I wanted to happen, and not for the reason you might think. I couldn't be in love with her, because she has a boyfriend. I knew she had a boyfriend from the day we met, but I never thought I'd fall in love with her like that.

As ""M"" and I were each other's best friend, she often asked me for advice with her boyfriend too. She struggled a lot, because it was a long distance relationship and she hadn't seen him for a year. It was never an issue for me to give her advice, I thought she deserved the best advice I could give her, but once I realized I was in love, giving advice was so much harder. I spent the next few days trying to convince myself not to be in love with her, but it was all futile. I finally realized there was no going back, and I had to confront my issue. We had been writing letters for each other since March to give to each other on the day she had to leave, and she'd often ask to see snippets of my letter because she really liked it and was impatient. One day I asked her, ""Do you want to see a part of my letter?"" To which she responded ""OF COURSE!"" I showed her this big paragraph basically explaining to her that it was undeniable that I was in love with her but that I still 100% respected her relationship with her boyfriend, and that I didn't seek anything out of being in love with her. She was completely understanding and said "" We definitely could've been something if I didn't have a boyfriend,"" which was all I needed to hear for closure.

It's now May 10th and everyday matters, because ""M"" had to leave on June 6th. Our friendship didn't really change after I told her I was in love, which was nice. The days are winding down, and we are really dreading her leaving. Every now and then we'd get in little fights, only because we were afraid one of us would stop talking to the other. It would go something like this :

""M"" : ""You better call me a lot once I'm gone""

Me : ""Of course I'll call you, if anyone isn't gonna call, it's you.""

""M"" : ""OMG OF COURSE I""LL CALL YOU, THATS FUCKED UP YOU THINK I WOULDN'T""

and then we'd laugh it off. The days went on, and it became June 4th, the last day we were allowed to hang out. We exchanged letters and I got her a bracelet. She cried a lot, we hugged, and she was gone. She got back to her home country on June 7th, and I messaged her and tried to have a conversation. She was being super brief with me, I figured it was because she was just getting settled back in and seeing her family + boyfriend for the first time in a while, so I decided to give her a week of not texting her unless she texts me. A week goes by and it is the day I plan on messaging her, but to my surprise I had a message from her. She said, "" Why haven't you messaged me."" I explained to her that I was just letting her get settled in back home, and she understood. The next day I tried to call her and she didn't answer. Then I'd text her and she gave me a short response. I was really confused, but my family was going on vacation to the beach so i figured that'd take my mind off of it. Boy was I wrong.

The whole time I was at the beach she never messaged me first, and when I'd message her she'd take like 4 hours to respond every time. One of the mornings I woke up at 4am to call her because it would be 10am where she was, so I figured it would be more convenient for her. She didn't answer, and when she saw the missed call she said ""whoops"". This was uncharacteristic of her, she'd normally apologize and call me back. This made me upset.

Visitation with my dad was coming up for me. My dad lives in a country next to hers. ""M"" and I discussed when I visited him in the summer we could drive to her country and visit her. Well, that is exactly what my dad and I did, and we were both super excited. My dad wanted to meet her and I wanted her to meet him (since ""M"" and I had talked about him a lot). I reminded ""M"" a week before I got there that I was gonna be in her country for 4 days and she replied ""Ok, but I'll be on vacation on 2 of the days that you'll be here"". That was fine by me, as long as I got to see her for one day. 2 days go by, and I ask if she wants to meet in her capital city (10 mins from her house). She said, ""Idkkk, what would we do blah blah blah."" Then she didn't reply to me until my dad and I had to leave. This really just tore a whole in my heart and I was devastated. I got angry with her and messaged her something like :

""Wow, thanks for just wasting my time""

""I'm sorry, I really am""

""Well why did you even make it seem like I could visit you.""

""I didn't know I'd feel differently about it now, Also I don't know how my boyfriend would react, you know it's weird for your girlfriend to see a guy who flew across the world to see her.""

""Then what's the point in being friends if we can't ever see each other.""

""Do you not want to be friends anymore?""

""I guess""

and that was that. My birthday came up a few days later and I apologized to her. I told her she was the best friend I have ever had and I didn't want to lose that, but at the same time I was still very upset. She just said, ""Ok, if we want to keep our friendship we have to call and text each other more, happy birthday btw."" I flew back to America and school started for me.""M"" and I would have a very short text conversation like once a week. One weekend she Facetimed me while she was drunk at a party. She asked me if I hated her and stuff. She has done that 3 times now. The only time she calls me is when she's drunk, and when I text her she takes 5 hours to respond. Today she messaged me that she was listening to the song we used to listen to all the time together, I told her I miss her. She said she missed me too. I asked if I could call her and she didn't open that message for like 6 hours, then she responded that she was going to bed. I don't know what to do anymore. I've had a feeling that it's time to let go for a while now, but I just can't. While I hate our relationship right now, what we had when she was in America was the best thing I've ever experienced, and she was the best person in my life."
relationship_advice,Caught my (34F) boyfriend (42M) at a random gas station in a woman’s car,"So I want to start off with, we’ve been together for 16 years. We have a 6 year old autistic child together. We’ve been living together most of our relationship. There’s a ton of history but I only have the effort to write so much. 

So to start. He has a work iPhone that is connected to our family account. I periodically check Find My iPhone to see where he’s at (i.e.To see when he might be getting home for dinner as he might be at the gym or grocery store until 6-6:30 after getting off work at 4:30. Or to see if he’s available to pick our son up if I’m running late at work. Etc.) 

A week or so ago, I noticed his location was at a gas station the is outside of town opposite of where we live. I figured he was meeting someone to sell something as he’s been doing that lately. But then I noticed he sat at this gas station for 30 minutes. So I called him, thinking maybe he was just waiting on someone to show. He didn’t answer. However, 5 minutes later I see he’s driving and then he calls me. Saying he’d been trying to get into a place to get his haircut but every place was busy (obviously a lie). That he was planning on trying one more place before driving home. I never asked him about it and let it go. 

Jump to tonight. Same thing, I’m running 10 minutes late leaving work and check to see if he went to the gym or not, and see he’s at the same gas station. I decided to pick our son up and drive out that way to see. (Son was engrossed in a game device the whole time) It takes me 35 minutes round trip to get there. I parked on the opposite side of the gas station. Walk around the building and peek and there is my boyfriend sitting inside a car with a blonde woman and they’re talking. I walk out and make eye contact with him, then just turned and left. I had to do an errand before going home (keeping myself together and normal for my son). So after I put our son to bed, I’m laying here in bed as he’s watching tv. Knowing he’s going to come in here in a while to talk. My stomach has been in knots ever since. We even had some good sex last night, though I know we don’t do it often. 

Should I demand his phone? Should I feel guilty about “checking up on him”? I know it was nothing good as who drives to meet a “friend” at a gas station then lies about it? He’s not a hanging out with friends type, either. 

Also, I’m fairly positive the woman is someone he went to high school with that he recently connected with when she was his Nurse during his knee surgery (that I attended with him)."
relationship_advice,Living situation from hell. All F20’s,"
I live in a 4x4 all girls in a off campus student apartment complex. Two of my roommates hate me because I asked them many times not to sell drugs/smoke drugs inside our apartment. They have started making up allegations that my dog is aggressive and loud to get me evicted and told me as such. I have a camera set up and when I am not home he is with a dog sitter. I sent all the video and dog sitting slips to the landlord and she drop the complaint and fines. But now they are calling the city and I’m starting to feel more and more harassed. I haven’t told our landlord about the drugs because I personally don’t like getting into others business and I’m worried they might be even worse if I do. My one roommates girlfriend lives here unofficially and is very violent and has beat her up so bad she had to go to the hospital. I don’t want to become her target and I’m not sure what I can do."
relationship_advice,Is being bored of a secure relationship a problem?,"This is obviously a throwaway account but I didn't know you had to include that so.....pardon me :)

I (23F) have been in an LDR with my boyfriend (24M) for almost 2 months now and I'm starting to get bored.

He's a (mostly) decent guy and I care for him but nowadays I find myself missing the novelty of talking to someone new. We get on very well and apart from a few bumps, the relationship's been very comforting. We can joke about almost anything under the sun and our personalities fit SO well.

However, lately, I've had nasty thoughts of talking to old flings and even thought of reactivating those trusty ""dating"" apps just so that I can chat with other people I don't already know and feel that ~thrill~

I want to know if this is something that will pass and everyone experiences it or if this is me trying to self-sabotage because I'm just so... comfortable.

How can I tell him I'm bored without offending him or hurting his feelings?

It's not a saucy ask but I'd appreciate anyone with an opinion or insight they'd like to share :)

Thank youuuu"
relationship_advice,One of my (26M) best friends (27M) is letting me stay with him and his wife (27F) while I'm starting a new job and looking for my own place,"So, to start, I moved a few years ago for work and recently moved back to town. My friend told me that I could crash with him for a bit while I started this new job and looked for a new place. I don't have a lot of money saved up, have loans I need to pay every month, and housing is expensive here so I took him up on it. He told me I am welcome as long as I want to stay but I am trying to limit it to as short of a stay as I need.

Him and I have been friends for about 5 years but immediately became really good friends (I was a groomsman at his wedding) and I have become somewhat friends with his wife over the years. My friend told me she said it was fine that I would be here for a bit. She has been super nice and welcoming since I arrived. They have newborn twins and my friend and his wife have the twins call me Uncle. I have offered to help around the house with housework, some money for bills, and I buy my own food.

Where I'm looking for some advice is: I feel like I'm intruding on their husband/wife time and family time in general. I work full time, have hobbies, and a few friends so I'm out of the house most of the time but when we are all just sitting around hanging out, I feel like I'm invading on their lives. I don't want to just stay in the bedroom the whole night and have them think I'm weird though either."
relationship_advice,I think I messed things up pretty bad :(,"So I’ve been talking to this girl for awhile now( I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe a few months) and recently we’ve been talking and hanging out more. Awhile back she had the idea of us going on a picnic and painting at the park she also wanted to feed ducks. Now to me and other it sounded like a date. After I asked her but she never really gave me a straight answer. So time passes we hang out on smaller occasions. Until maybe a week or two ago we went to a drive in. That was my idea. Her idea was to make a bed type area in the back. She also wanted to paint again. So that night instead of watching the movies(the drive in showed two) we played games and talked the entire time. We cuddled up while we play games it was really cute. Now two days before I asked her if it was a date and she told me she just got out a long term relationship and that she didn’t know she was really confused. But that night it felt like she actually had a thing for me. Also we talk like everyday, with a good morning and a how did you sleep text. Then in the middle of the day a drive safe and text me when you’re done text with a goodnight and sweet dreams text to end the night. So with all of that it hard for me to tell how she truly feels. Now yesterday we were talking and she kept thanking me and saying things like she appreciated how nice I was to her. And I said jokingly “stop because that’s a dangerous game” I ended up telling her I had feelings, she said she kinda had them too but again was confused because she just got out of something. Which is totally fair I don’t want to rush anything if she’s not there emotionally I respect her. But I do genuinely like her, and after telling her all of that she ghosted me. It’s been almost a whole day and she’s seen my text because it says read. But the funny thing is she sent me a snapchat earlier in the day. I don’t know what I should do, any advice?? Sorry the story is a little scattered around."

relationship_advice,Does she like me?,"Hi, I didn’t really know where to ask this and we aren’t in a romantic relationship but I need help.

First off we are the same age, I like her, and  the only reason I questioned if she likes me is because a friend said she probably does (before knowing my crush)
I’ve never really had a true ~crush~ where I get nervous talking to them and all that so I have no experience with guessing. People have had crushes on me and I didn’t know until they confessed. 
I’m getting a little off track so I will just get to the point. Here are things she does that I have read are signs:
•looks at me when laughing 
•Encourages me when I feel bad
•Scoots closer to me when near me 
• Laughs at all of my idiotic jokes
• Is excited to see me in the hall or when I enter class and so on.

Please help. I really like her and don’t want to confess and lose her as my friend. I have a few “wingmen” but they know as much as I do."

relationship_advice,He cheated twice. Does he get a 3rd chance?,"Posting on mobile so sorry if formatting is weird.


The first time was purely on him. He admitted to crossing boundaries. He begged for a 2nd chance &amp; swore he would never do it again. Now, The 2nd time however, he says it’s because I was distant &amp; hurtful. 
I travelled for 2 &amp; a half months. We video called &amp; spoke every single day. However one week when I wasn’t doing so well mentally &amp; was under a bit of stress, we barely spoke for about 3 days. He called me on day 4 &amp; I told him I wasn’t in the mood to talk to him &amp; that I needed some space. We didn’t speak for the rest of the week. He says that’s what pushed him to seek company &amp; attention elsewhere. After that week we went back to speaking daily until I got back home. I wasn’t even gone that long.
Anyways, I found out last week that’s he was cheating. He claims he wasn’t having sex with anyone but he was just sexting other ppl. Ofcourse I don’t believe him. 
I think he just couldn’t deal with me being away but I also think he never stopped cheating.

Wtf though?! I’m so messed up from this. Every relationship I’ve been in, the guy cheated. They’ve all said it wasn’t my fault, just temptation but he’s the first to actually blame me &amp; I feel so disgusted &amp; like I’m not good enough. I’m now convinced that’s it’s absolutely impossible for men to not cheat. I’m also seriously thinking that if I cheat too then I won’t end up hurt in the end. I’ve never cheated before &amp; I’ve always tried to be a person of integrity but now I’m just thinking “fuck it! Fuck everyone &amp; everything”. No one deserves my honesty. I don’t wanna screw anyone over &amp; I’m gonna stay as far away from relationships as I possibly can.

relationship_advice,Can I [36/M] save the marriage with my [36/F] wife?,"(TL;DR at the end)

I will try to be concrete to avoid excessive text: My wife and I started our relationship back in college at 19 years old, and after 6 years dating we got married in 2008. During our relationship we only had 1 break period on 2006 -after college- because she cheated on me, but I forgave her and rebuilt things from there. She was my first girlfriend so I felt at loss without her and I think this motivated a lot my intention on getting back instead of moving forward and knowing somebody else.

We have had what looks as a very stable marriage: always worked out issues before going to bed, never slept in couch, haven't used hurtful words or insults in our fights and resolved our stuff after like adults. We have 4 dogs, no kids, and have grown economically to a point where we can afford luxury things without worrying of not having food on the table or hot water. We will finish our mortgage in 5 years, and that's about our only debt.

Something happened on my side in mid 2018 - a remote coworker [23/F] started a friendlier-than-usual chat with me, and I chose to carry on leading to flirting, and ultimately having an affair with her. Due to work I could arrange travels to meet her and spent some days together across 2018-2019. My wife caught a bit of my conversation with CW on the cellphone and things got very difficult, naturally she lost the trust in me but regained it gradually. I also stopped the affair gradually, and had what seemed a last conversation on past September. It's worth mentioning my wife only knows about the chat, but not that CW and I have met in real life.

These last months went by with no communication of any type with CW, until I got an email from her stating that she had gone through a lot, dreaming about me almost daily, and hoped that email saying that she was doing finally OK after therapy and medication, could be the means to get rid of me from her dreams. While I didn't reply during the first 2 weeks, I finally did last week.

After CW and I stopped our thing, I thought about her at least once almost daily: ""what could she be doing?"", ""I remember her smile"", ""would she be with her friends?"", etc., but to my own-self I was still focused at home, with the holiday season and everything. While on Christmas 2018 some relatives raised an eyebrow because they saw me and my wife distant, this year was not the case at all. To my own self, I thought I had things under control.

Today I realize that I am thinking about CW way too much, fantasizing about moving cities, picking her up from work, etc; and when I look at my wife, I cannot feel the same way like when I remember thinking of her as my partner for life. I try to scratch here and there but simply won't get excited and with butterflies in my stomach, like when it is about CW. And I feel awful because of it.

Did I really steer completely away from my wife and now have a new person in my mind and heart? Can counseling and couples therapy help here? My psychologist (whom I started to see only past week because of this) said ""The heart cannot go wrong"" and that scared me a lot.

Sorry for any typos or weird expressions, English is not my first language.

TL;DR: Had an apparent happy and stable marriage for 10 years, a new person shows up, I have and affair and end it after being caught. 4 months after got contacted again and I only think of her, and not my wife - Can I save my marriage?"
relationship_advice,My friends [24Ms] never offer me food [24F] when I’m over during dinner time,"This sounds petty I feel, but my friends are dating and live together.  I usually hang out with them during dinner time which means I’m usually hungry around this time, and they’re usually eating during the time I’m over.  I hang out with them almost every day, and they never offer me any food, and when I ask for food, they tell me I can have a bite but that’s it, even if it’s chips and dip.  This means if I hang out with them I either have to eat beforehand, bring my own food, go hungry, or buy something at the corner store.  Money has been tight lately so I haven’t been able to grab something at the corner store as much, which means if I get hungry while I’m there, I have to decide between going home to eat or staying there and being hungry.  This wouldn’t be a huge issue if they weren’t eating in front of me and making me hungrier.  I understand when they buy food they do it planning it to feed themselves and not three people, but idk I just always feel weird being there watching them cook and eat dinner or chips and not even offering me anything.  We usually don’t hang out at my place so I get that if they were constantly giving me food and I wasn’t contributing, it would wear on their budget, but I feel weird about the fact that they never offer me anything.  We’re usually not at my place, but if we are and I’m cooking or eating, I usually offer them something.  Is this something I should address or should I adjust my expectations and plan better?"
relationship_advice,My story.,"[THIS IS REALLY LONG]


Hello,

I was in a relationship with this girl for 2 years. She was my first ever, even though I was 19 when we first got together but I never saw it in myself to get committed into something serious, I felt more freedom being single and screwing with whoever I wanted.
But she was different, she texted first  and when I saw the first text I got from her my heart dropped and I never knew the exact reason why until later. We texted for a while then got together and I just fell in love, it was something new, a feeling I never experienced before, completely different from lust and fwb etc
I loved that girl with all my heart, she was my everything, my sunshine, my every thought. I wasnt obsessed but I was completely in love with her. Things went perfect the first 4 5 months then the bad stuff started to sprout. 
I was really committed and wasnt taking the relationship lightly and when we had fights and such I would just tell my self to chill this happens in all relationships. 
But things just kept getting worse. I eventually found out she was jealous. Not your ordinary jealous, she was on a whole new level. She wouldn't let me interact with the opposite gender in any way or sort. Got to a point where she would lose her temper and get all cold and low radar mad when I mentioned female relatives to her! But hey you gotta be patient man, you love this girl I kept telling myself.
She was never a good talker either, in those 2 years+ that we dated she never truly opened up her heart to me, she loved me she was crazy about me but never really opened up and it made me feel so bad as I'm supposed to be the closest person to her, and seeing that she cant find it in herself to tell me her problems and her bothers made me feel like I was doing something wrong.
She was always doubtful, always thinking I had other girls in my life. I did literally everything I could do to prove to her that this wasnt the fact but to no avail.
Even when we fought she would rarely try to fix things. Many times it would be her fault and I would have to just let it slide and initiate the peace making  just to get things back to normal.

I was patient I was truly patient in every way and form, but I am human and one day we had a fight and I just.. reached my limit. It was awful. I erupted like a mountain I've never seen my self that angry before and I just broke up with her. 
At first she didnt take it seriously but when she realized I was serious she started begging, telling me 'I beg you, please dont do this' 'I'm so sorry' etc. 
But I wasnt myself at all I was furious, I didn't go soft with her at all and persisted. 
Time went by, months, she kept on trying and I kept on curving her even though deep inside of me I was screaming to get back with her but honestly.. I was afraid, afraid to return to what I was in. 
She stopped eventually but we stayed in touch.

 I got with another girl some 7 or 8 months after the breakup. Shes perfect in every way and treats me like a king but I know deep down inside of me that my heart still belongs to my ex. I just cant stop thinking about her. I know this sounds crazy but I still do love her, I broke up with her even though i was still mad for her. And now I'm with this insanely sweet, understanding, adorable girl but I'm just simply doing her wrong, because I still ache for my ex.

relationship_advice,"Dating a girl, and now we're just talking? (like seriously I don't know where else to go rn)","So me (17M) and this girl (16F)work together at a small grocery store, I had worked for abt ten months before she got hired. She comes along, and after abt a month, we get each other's snap and 3 days later we go on our first date, Christmas day. I've never dated before so idk what I'm doing, but today she tells me that she doesn't wanna call us dating bc we still don't know much abt each other yet, even tho we have gone out multiple times, it's still only been a month. I like her a lot, and as far as ik she's always said she likes me too, but she says she feels like we're still in the talking stage, and when we get to know each other better then we can call us dating- she doesn't want the girlfriend title. Is this a sign of a failing relationship or is it too early to tell? I mean I've known this girl for a month but still we had a thing going, and now... We don't? I don't understand and I need some help.. for perspective we've hung out probably like 10 times so far, so admittedly not much. I just don't wanna lose her... Any thoughts?

Tl;Dr - been ""dating"" a month now, gf says feels like still in talking stage, idk how to progress..."
relationship_advice,I hope you knew,"I hope you knew that it was never my intention to hurt you. 

I hope you knew that I didn’t mind if we couldn’t afford nice things, I only wanted your love.
I hope you knew that my positivity was never there, it was a facade.
I hope you knew that you were my rain when I felt a year of dehydration and misery
You were my sunflower when I was stuck in the winter all cold
You were my sleep, when I forced myself awake at night over and over and over again
You were my paint when I would I stare at a blank canvas wishing for something to appear by you 
And you were my light when I was alone in the dark hoping for a way out
I hope you knew that my love was never fading. I loved you more than I loved myself 
I hope you know that when I’d see you, my heart fluttered so much that it gave me a stomach ache.


and I hope you know I didn’t ever mind that stomach ache.
Thankyou for ever being mine and I wish you all the happiness in your future"
relationship_advice,My (M21) Girlfriend(F21) wants me to move in with her. I don't know if I will be ready.,"Ive been dating my GF for 6 months now. Everything has been going great and we've had maybe one or 2 serious arguments in that time. I truly am starting to love this girl and can see a future with her. Here comes my problem though. She wants to move in together in 9 months from now. Itll be in an apartment where we split all bills evenly. I currently live with my parents and do well with saving my money, as I only have a car payment + insurance totaling about 580 a month. My issue is if I dont know if im ready to move in with someone ive only been dating a year. I cannot tell the future and dont know if something will happen where our relationship is broken; or where we just can't live there anymore. Whenever she asks if I want to move in with her I usually just say sure in a tone that shows im unsure or I say I dont know. She gets very upset when I say anything other than a serious yes. What's also conflicting me is that her current lease ends in 9 months. She says she will have no where to go if we end up not living together and she does not want to renew her current lease because her roommate is terrible. I feel like if I dont move in with her we might break up or she'll just be very mad at me for essentially making her homeless unless she finds something she can afford on her own. I don't wanna move in if im not ready and I just don't know if I will be. I love her but at the same time I dont wanna make such a big jump so soon and have everything come crashing down. What do I do? No, breaking up right now is not happening. Please do not say to break up because we are incompatible, etc."
relationship_advice,"New employee (M24) is being disrespectful toward me (F27), his manager","I manage a team of 10 people at a mid-size corporation. I’ve got a new employee who joined our team about a month ago. He came in with no relevant experience (it’s an entry-level job). 

Recently I’ve started to notice little things that he does, almost like micro-aggressions. For example, he will occasionally make small semi-negative remarks about people in other departments that we work in conjunction with. I tried to convince myself it was in my head and that maybe he just has a strong personality. But earlier this week it reached a peak when he essentially tried to tell me I didn’t know what I was talking about, even though I’ve been in his role for over five years. I was especially taken back considering he is still in training and has no prior professional experience whatsoever.

I try to foster a collaborative working environment with my team. I’m always open to suggestions. And I really don’t mind my team members disagreeing with me. But, without going into too many details, he basically was acting like he knew more than me about something that he absolutely did not. It was uncomfortable, as I tried to calmly explain to him why I asked him to do something a certain way, and he escalated the situation as he got defensive over something he wasn’t particularly informed about to begin with. And he’s still in training! He’s not even successfully performing tasks independently yet!

We’ve got a one-on-one tomorrow and I’m honestly dreading it. Yes, I’ve had team members question ideas or our processes before, but never in a disrespectful way. On top of that, I’ve had one of my employees tell me he was routinely being whiney to them about what are essentially his basic job functions, and had told them I’d keep an eye out for that behavior (because it was clearly having at least a small-scale effect on morale).

How do you work with someone with this personality type? I do think he has great potential, and I want to see him succeed. But yikes!"
relationship_advice,Getting paranoid about aging in my relationship,"I’m 23f and my spouse is 26m. He just turned 26 and I’ll be 24 in May. 

I’m starting to get paranoid that once I’m older he’s going to stop being attracted to me. I am also a mom and he’s admitted that my breasts have changed negatively, but he was just being honest. And honestly they have, they’ve became deflated and smaller and saggy. Even asymmetrical. 

He likes to watch the “teen porn” category and it just like makes my heart sink. I know those girls are really like 18-25 or something? Idk. But I’m getting super depressed about myself and I feel insecure. 

Our relationship isn’t very strong either. we’ve been in a rough spot for quiet some time and this paranoia is making me want to leave. I’m terrified of becoming a 30 year old woman who’s partner isn’t attracted to them anymore and just looks at younger girls. 
I have mentioned this to him before and he said that he thinks the older he gets the more he’ll be attracted to older women, so that I don’t have to worry. But I don’t think that’s true. 
Look at all the older men who are with younger women. 
I’m so stressed out about my age and I’m only 23."

relationship_advice,I'm (20M) having a talk with my girlfriend (20F) about our sexual compatibility tonight,"I need some pointers to make this more of a discussion with my girlfriend rather than an admittance of insecurity.

To put it bluntly, our sex life isn't that great. For me, at least. I take a long time to finish, and she takes a very short time to finish. I make her orgasm 2-3 times each session whereas I have finished a grand total of once from sex alone with her. We usually need to end up stopping since it hurts for her (and yes, we use lube). 

Anyways, we are going for a drive tonight and I have no idea how to approach this. I don't want to seem insecure, but I want to address the issue. I am afraid I'll make her feel badly about it and just end up making things worse. 

Furthermore if anyone has any tips to make sex hurt less for her or make me finish faster I'd love to hear. We might try using toys for males soon but we will see."

relationship_advice,"How can I (26F) be supportive of my sister (24F) when she says she wants to have the same career as me to prove to others that she is ""as great as I am""?","Sorry as it's a bit long and English is not my first language. I'm seriously, seriously lost about what I should do in this situation, so your help would mean the world to me.

I always liked to study. Like, a lot. My sister not so much, although she would master any subject if she put her mind on it. I just finished medical education and since we live in a small town and being a doctor here is really overrated, my parents have been bragging a lot lately to their friends, who in turn keep sending them congratulations, saying that being a doctor is not the same as any other career and so forth. My sister is studying law and this year she'll graduate. She likes it a lot, her grades are incredible, she is already working in a office and her bosses really admire her (she will probably have a spot there as soon as she graduates), but it seems this doesn't mean a thing to my parents or other people. 

Today we were having a chat and she confessed that she is thinking about getting a fresh start and going into a medical career as soon as she graduates law school, but now she doesn't know if it's something she really wants to do or if she just wants to prove to everybody that she can do as good or better than me. I must assure again that I never felt I was better than her, we are successful right now because we work hard on everything we do. I also remember that she had been interested in being a doctor before I even managed to get into medical school and she is always asking me about the field and what I used to do in college and etc, so I really think she would like being a law or a medical professional equally. The problem is that I don't know what to say or do to help her. It crushes me to see her even thinking that she isn't good enough and that she has to prove anything to anybody. What can or should I do?"

Perfect teeth, long hair, extremely muscular 😍 I’ve been with fairly attractive people but he’s in another league of its own now.

relationship_advice,I (23f) am hurting my relationship with my partner (34m) because of body dysmorphia,"I am struggling with body dysmorphia.

It’s never enough though. I’m obsessive and i cry and go on and on about my flaws. He works 3rd shift so I spend most my night texting him about it. The other night he got upset and begged me for please just one night I don’t do this. And he cried and told me how he’s been crying at work because he’s so stressed about me. I feel awful. I know how much he loves and cares about me. I know he would love me even if I looked how I perceive myself. I’ve been trying to keep my feelings in more and stop relying on him so much about it. I struggle trying to be happy go lucky when I’m obsessing or feeling down and he can tell and asks if I’m ok. So I tell him I’m okay. But then he pushes for more. But I want to stop bombarding him with my problems. I also have bi polar 2. My mental health has taken a big toll on our relationship. He has been great at helping me. But I know because my mom always struggled with mental health, just how hard it is. I have started treatment for my bi polar and I have gotten a lot better. But I still am struggling. I feel like he’s reaching the end of his rope with my mental health and it feels awful and it breaks my heart that I’ve put so much pressure on him.

relationship_advice,I’m (33F) falling for my friend (31M).,"We met at work and I thought there was a definite connection.  Spend most of my time at work with him, group projects, etc. Started having marathon phone conversations outside of work, lasting upwards of 4h each convo.  Developed a crush, I told him I was into him.  He told me the feeling wasn’t exactly one-sided, but said he wanted to focus on a work-related project that is extremely stressful, requires a huge time commitment, is stupidly intense, and lasts until September.  I assumed he was letting me down gently.  I also didn’t want to wait around until September to find out if he was letting me down gently.  

That’s cool.  We’re grown-ups, so I respect his decision and continue being friends with him.  It’s been awhile since I shared my feelings for him, and I’m a little frustrated that they’ve friggin’ intensified since then.  The more I get to know him, the more I appreciate him as a human being.  Since he and I have become friends, I have felt like I have become a stronger, happier, more self-assured person from the sharing of our thoughts and ideas.  I look forward to our marathon conversations.  I get butterflies in my stomach when I see him.

This friendship has become one of the most important ones of my adult life and while I’d prefer to be able to call him my partner, I want to have him in my life in whatever context.  He is, without question, the most genuine, authentic person I have ever encountered.  I want to protect my little idiot heart because I’m notorious for allowing my feelings about someone consume my thoughts and then feeling bummed out because my “love” is unrequited.  

How do I maintain this friendship without my heart getting trashed?"

But while venting, he said ""I'll stick my dick in her mouth, just shut up"" and that just made me feel so sick. I told him don't say that, that's really gross.

relationship_advice,How do I [22M] know if she actually wants us to work [22F] LDR,"Hi. Incoming wall of text. I really need some help/criticism/anything to take my mind off this.

I've been in a long distance relationship (NYC, but working/living in London) with my other half who's near LA. We met online and we've met twice. Once in Paris on Christmas Day in 2018 and in Summer 2019 in Amsterdam. She flew back from her family vacation on the way to see me (rather than coming to Europe).

We've had really good highs but recently things have turned sour - sour is an understatement. She's Palestinian and her family have incredibly high expectations of her, almost to the point her dad has implied he'll be choosing her future husband, maybe from where she comes from originally. I'm North African, but for some reason that's not approved of by her parents. It's never been a problem for her, but she's not in a situation to go against her parents (financial stability, housing etc). 

Sorry to go back and forth here, but we've spent a lot of time together, we'd Facetime and video call (dates and such) at least every other day, and she was/is my best friend more than anything. 

Going back to Summer 2019 - In Amsterdam, I felt things were different. She was distant, we had fun but it wasn't as romantic, as intimate. She felt bad for misleading her mother, even though it was a short layover we had. She took me to the side at the airport and said no matter what became or happened to us, to always be strong and encouraged my sobriety. I felt like that was her saying goodbye.

Anyway, a few months pass in October time. This is where things get difficult. My grandmother died within three days of being admitted to hospital. It came as such a shock and I was tasked with a lot of responsibility, looking after my grandfather, so I was kind of ghosting her whilst trying to give her enough information, and I guess she understood that.

Throughout the relationship, my biggest ""concern"" was loyalty. Because we were an LDR, and she's the most gorgeous girl I've ever known, I knew people were trying to get at her. I know she's introverted and she usually wouldn't entertain it and every time I'd bring it up, she'd say I was insecure and that I was the problem for bringing it up.

I don't really recall how, but I ended up calling her bluff and said I knew she spoke to multiple guys, initiated conversation. She didn't physically cheat but I don't know the full extent of it. I think she was possibly on Tinder and messaged up to 6-8 people but I have no idea on that. After this, I completely lost my shit. She apologised and said she didn't have the heart to tell me she didn't want us in Amsterdam, but then recently she said it was because she wanted to please her family. She said it was me who she wanted.  

Here's the part that I should probably post to Am I The Asshole - I did threaten her, not to the extent of posting pictures of her, but telling her family and her friends about the situation she put us in (e.g. cheating etc). She came clean to her parents and really suffered as a result of that (grounded, no phone etc). Her mother pretty knows the current situation.

Knowing I had a turbulent few months and still do, I asked her why she chose to hurt me when she had the choice to help me heal. She really was taken back by that, and I definitely can tell she regrets what happened. However, I ghosted for about a week into the New Year. She's got a job now, whilst at college, so any attempt I make at reaching out to her, she gets annoyed at. She says she's tired because she's working, but every time I sit down and say let's schedule a time to call, she won't do it.

In the meantime, she's making separate social media accounts and calling it ""2020 a new start, dream big"" so it sounds like she's preparing for life without me. The big plan for me is to literally go back to the US and spend a week with her when I have vacation time, and then if she wants it, we can talk long-term about marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

I've really glossed over everything here but my biggest concern that is I'm chasing shadows or fighting a losing war. I love her, I want her, but I feel like a burden even pressing ""Send message"".

&amp;#x200B;

relationship_advice,Help! I have boy problems!:/,"Hi my name is Emma! I’m in need of help and advice from the community. I have this weird relationship with this guy. So I’ll start from the beginning, I saw this guy in my class and I was attracted to him. He flirted with me and all that but then things got complicated...I got into a relationship with a different guy and he got into a relationship with a different girl. He would still flirt. Later on they broke up and he kept hitting on me. I was still in a relationship. Sadly I ended up getting dumped by my bf. And then this guy asked me out right away. I said no because I had just gotten dumped. So fast forward he would pass me in the halls and always look up from his phone to look at me. And he tried to make me jealous by dating this crazy girl but it literally lasted 5 days...and he’s always done this. So finally it’s senior year this year and he asks me out. We date and it ended rather quickly which was sad to me because I really really liked him. And I’ve always noticed that he always remembers the little things about me. Yet sometimes he can be a real asshole. But anyways I need y’all’s help.

relationship_advice,20 M 20 F I caught my gf kind of flirting with another girl?,"So we've been dating about 7 months or so and our relationship was a little different than most due to some personal drama going on. So essentially we ended up being roommates about 2 months into the relationship. Things have been kind of difficult at times because of this and I'll also add shes openly asked to be in an open relationship or have threesomes and I've turned them down as im just not that type of guy however I ALWAYS make sure she feels she can leave if this is not the type of relationship she wants and she always assures me it is. However today I saw some messages between a girl we'll call her( girl A), girl A started by asking her out to meet up as they're both bisexual. My gf declined and said shes in a relationship however the entire conversation after that consisted of them discussing how stuck she felt in a monogamous relationship with me and talking about porn, masturbating, and also saying they had a crush on each other in high school. The conflict with me is that none of it was very explicit and was pretty general in terms of discussion. I wouldn't call it cheating but it's real close is how I would describe it. My Gf claims she didn't really realize she was being inappropriate and she still wants me and still wants to be with me and her saying those things was venting from a previous argument we had. She promised not to talk to her anymore however I still feel really off about all of it. Am i stupid for staying? Should I continue to believe her about not intending to be inappropriate with that girl?"
relationship_advice,I [26F] partly blame myself for the destruction of my relationship with my boyfriend [26M],"My boyfriend and I have been together now for 1 year and 3 months. What started as a hookup from Tinder turned into a serious relationship.

1 month before our anniversary, we started watching porn together...and then it escalated into my developing kink for him liking other porn girls, like while we watch a video, I would ask him what he would like to do with that girl on the video, and that would always turn me on. At first, I could tell he was a bit uncomfortable and he would even say “well uhm, I want to do that to you”, etc instead of “I wanna fuck her like that”. 

Few months later, unfortunately I had to move to another city for a job. It’s been a long distance relationship until now, but I would occasionally fly to his town for a visit. 

Now, whenever we’re cities apart and we would have phone sex, sometimes he would say “ugh I want a pussy so bad right now”. To which I reply, “aww too bad, I’m not there”. But later on, I almost made a Tinder account with his profile just so he can hook up with someone.

The thing is, the thought of him hooking up with someone else turns me on ONLY when I am horny. But after that, I hate it so much cos I’m jealous, and because I have been cheated on in the past by an ex and I’m always afraid that he’s gonna cheat on me.

Now for Christmas break, I flew over to his place and then he secretly created a Tinder account and in the bio it says “looking for a third”. (Yeah btw, he’s into threesome and I said yes to it as long as I get to choose the girl). But it wasn’t really a secret to me because when I glanced on his phone, I saw the Tinder logo. So I secretly made a fake Tinder profile of an Asian girl I found on Instagram (cos he’s into Asian girls) and we suddenly matched. 

So we “chatted” on Tinder, and my Tinder self said I’m keen for a threesome. That’s when he told me, as his gf, that he actually made a Tinder account and that he felt bad about it for doing it behind my back, and that he found someone who wants to go for a threesome. So I said sure, let’s do it one time, but I never gave him a clear go signal. But we continued to chat on Tinder, and at this point I thought of testing him. I told him I’d only go for a threesome with his gf if he meets me alone in person and we’d fuck first without his gf knowing. He said yes to it and later on my fake Tinder self and him would sext while he’s in the toilet and my real self was in the living room.

One night, my “real self” told my bf that I’m gonna go and sleep in the bedroom, and he said sure go ahead cos he was still playing ps4. But little did he know that I was just setting a trap. My Tinder self asked him if we could meet and just go for a quickie. He said “you’re gonna get me into trouble, but I might be able to sneak out cos my gf is sleeping now”. And so he did. I literally heard him get out of the door, and he walked to the park where my Tinder self said we will meet (our distance on Tinder shows less than km so I lied and said I live just right around his area). So I got a message saying he’s already waiting at the park, and my Tinder self messaged him saying “good, cos I’m not real lol. I’m not even Asian and I was just messing with you”. Obviously he was pissed, and he walked back home. He went to bed with me and even kissed and cuddled me as if nothing happened. I acted like he woke me up and I asked him where he’s been, and he said he just went to get a cigarette.

A month has passed and I’m back living in the city where I have my job. Sometimes we would have a conversation where I’d ask him “have you ever cheated on me? Did you ever meet that girl from Tinder?” and he would always respond with a no. I know he never met that girl because that girl was me, but I couldn’t help but get paranoid that he might have met someone else after that.

Today, we just had an argument that led him to ask if we are breaking up, and I said, “I don’t know, are you being an honest and loyal boyfriend to me?” His reply was “you deserve someone who is”. So I told him he basically just admitted that he’s not loyal, and he never replied til now.

We never confirmed if we’ve broken up, but I definitely don’t trust him anymore after that Tinder incident. It breaks my heart cos I’m blaming myself for what this relationship has turned into."
relationship_advice,Do you think dating a non-college educated man be a bad idea for me?,"Hey, guys! I’m a 21-year-old female college student. I’m one semester away from graduating with my degree in accounting. 

In my college, women outnumber men in almost all disciplines except for engineering. Most of my female friends are happily dating blue-collar men who have never been to college. Seeing my friends so happy with their partners has made me question if I’m shutting out some good men by restricting my dating pool to college educated men.

I was brought up in a family that highly values higher education. Both of my parents have PhDs and my older brother is currently in med school. I have always been attracted to men who are insightful, knowledgeable &amp; “worldly” ( I’m not sure what that even means lol). I have a keen interest in discussing topics such as philosophy, history, geography, ethics , arts and science. I always thought those deep intellectual conversations are only to be had with people who are college-bound,I could be wrong though. 

I want to be as open minded as possible but I’m also slightly worried about wasting the guy’s time.When I shared those thoughts with my mom, she told me that a blue collar man would never be a good fit for me and I would be regretting my decision later!! 

TLDR; Anybody in a mixed collar relationship? I would appreciate some insights! None of my family members would ever accept a non-college graduate as my partner!"
relationship_advice,Confused..stay or leave,"I have been with my boyfriend for going on 2 years and I recently moved in with him in September of last year. He is very good to me and the relationship is over all good. He is a very sweet introverted 33 year old man and I am 32. He talks about our future often and he mentions getting a house together and moving to another state in the next year. I thought these were all very good signs for commitment down the road, but I was wrong. 

His mother has a very unhealthy enmeshed relationship with my boyfriend and she has been diagnosed with dependency personality disorder. She pretty much treats him like her husband without the sex. Her whole life revolves around him and she is very jealous of his friends that are women and says she is his best friend and gets angry if anyone else says they know him better. The strange thing is she says she loves me and wants me to be with him sometimes. I feel like she may mean this as long as her place in his life does not change and she doesn't seem to view me as a threat (but his best friend that is a woman she absolutely hates). 

7 months ago she let me know that she went to dinner with his female bestfriend. She thought the friend truly wanted to see her because she missed her. It turns out the entire conversation was focused on me and the friend wanted to know  the 100 questions about me. His friend told his mom that I was not good for him, was bringing him down in life, and all of his friends wanted nothing to do with me and didn't want me around. She then lied to his mom and said that I had announced in front of all of his friends that "" last night was so good and I hurt so good and I cant wait to take him home"". This absolutely never left my mouth and I even verified with my boyfriend and he said it didn't happen. Also, his friend kept saying that his mom ""created the monster"" and it was her fault we were together because she encouraged my bf to date me. Yes, his mom wanted us together but it was my boyfriends decision to date me. His mom told me not to trust her and that it is her goal to break us up and if she is nice to me it is all an act. I could already sense that his best friend hated me because she always rolls her eyes when I am around and does a long sigh and exhale if I talk. My boyfriend only recently started noticing this was happening after I told him to please watch her around me. He did say his friends are fine with me and doesn't understand why anybody this was said but he believes his mom has a vendetta against his best friend and is trying to get me to get her out of my boyfriend's life. 

The reason that his mom hates his best friend is because she recently chose to move to Savannah, GA with his older sister because she is unable to afford to live and she finally realized that Ben needed to be an adult because of the guilt is constantly feels for his mother AND because she got it in her head that if she left for a bit that he would propose to me if she gave him space. The best friend told his mom that she should stay in her new town and not come back to our state and this angered her to the point that she didn't want anything to done with her and her goal is to get the friend out of Ben's life for good. The reason is because her one goal is to get back to her one true love...her son. How dare someone tell her that her son was doing great actually being able to live an adult life alone lol. 

Months later I heard the other side of the story and according to his friend his mom said she needed both of us to break up so she could get her rightful place back with her son and she was afraid that I was going to take him away from him. Also, two of her other friends called her with the same concerns even though they have not met me, but because it has happend to them in the past. 

It's hard to know who to believe but his mom brings up the conversation that she had with his best friend every single time she calls me and tells me it is my job to get my bf away from his friend.  Every time she brings it up it makes me so sad to constantly be hearing negativity about how much someone dislikes you. 

Fast forward to present. She has decided that since we have been together almost 2 years that we should be engaged. She calls me about 3 times a week to talk about her concerns. She said that the last time we came to visit in December she flat out asked him if he was going to marry me and he said he didn't know. She calls me multiple times a week to let me know that she doesn't understand and the whole reason that she moved away was to give us time to move our relationship forward amd that I need to consider asking him flat out about his plans for me and if he doesnt know then I need to move out this month.  Also, that a man knows if they want to marry you after a year and a half.

I spoke to boyfriend about what was happening. I asked him if it's true that he really doesn't have any inclination if he sees a future with me and what his mom keeps harping on is really eating at me. He got very defensive and said, ""I don't know!! That's a big decision...I don't know who I am going to marry and who I will end up with!!"" 

I said that his mom is right and he probably should have an idea if he sees a future with me or not by now. I'm not asking for engagement, but I am asking if he sees a future with me or not. This whole situation has me so low and honestly I wasn't focusing on this until his mom started calling me over the last month about it asking and asking and asking again when I have no answers. 

Last night we talked again because he saw that I was visibly upset. Ben said that he believes that his mom is manipulating me and that her one goal is to move back in with me and is probably trying to get me out of the way. He said his mom does love me, but he knows if it was up to her she would be the only woman in his life and she wants it to be like it was before. 

Then he stopped and thought long and hard and said that he did see us getting married and having kids, but he had not put much thought into it. "" I let you move in didn't I? I take care of you while your healing ( I was in a car accident). If that doesn't show you commitment then I don't know what does!! I thought we were both enjoying the relationship...I have truly enjoyed it and you have to know that I love you. I'm going to start being more mindful and decide if we can be together, but I have no timeline. I really feel like you are trying to skip steps when we are still getting to know each other. You have been sick most of our relationship so I don't know what normal with you is! Also, the last time I was thinking about proposing to my last gf I started being very critical of all of her flaws and kept asking myself if I wanted this in a wife so I backed out.""

All I wanted him to do was say easily that he saw a future with me. Right now I feel very uneasy with his mom, best friend, and his lack of certainty about me. 

My sister said I should wait until the 3 year mark before I leave because with his track record he is slow moving. Also, she said that I need to cut his mom out because she is influencing me negatively which is spilling into how I think about myself and life.

What do you think I should do? Stay and wait for him to pick me or leave and choose myself."
relationship_advice,My boyfriend won't tell me how much money he makes,"

I've been dating Conor (not his real name) for about 9 months now. He's the best man I have ever dated far. I had been lurking on this sub and tried to use the correct methods, no sex for 2 months, he pays for dates etc. I have tried offering to pay my way from time to time but he insists on paying for dinner etc. He always says ""I invited you out, so it's my treat"". He'll let me pay the tip in cash if I offer.

He treats me really well and is an incredible lover making sure I always finish, I've never dated a guy who paid that much attention before and he really makes me feel special. He's also the first guy who doesn't try to pressure me for oral sex. I've done it twice on him vs some past BFs always got mopey if I refused.

I have an okay job making around $36,000 per year and I have some savings of approximately $20,000 and a small 401k. I've shared all these details with Conor but he has yet to share his finances with me. I've tried talking to him about it but he refuses to budge. I know he owns his own house which is nice and modern and he lives in a much nicer area than I do (I have roommates). He also drives a Tesla Model 3 and works in finance. He's definitely a HVM. But he won't disclose any of his finances and it's stressing me out.

I do want to get married soon. I'd like to have 2 kids and Conor wants to be a dad, we've briefly discussed these things. I'd also like to be a SAHM as I hate working.

He says that his finances are his business and unless we're engaged he won't disclose them. 

What do I do?"
relationship_advice,Should I disown my parents,"Ive had it with my Parents, I dont know what else to do, as long as I live in their house I have to deal with them but that will be changing shortly because im enlisting in the Air Force this year. My parents get on my nerves to the fucking max. I work from 6am to 6pm every god damn day and bust my ass, I come home and ask if my girlfriend can come over and they complain about how they hate people being in their house and how they hate to leave the door unlocked and they’re delusional and convinced that someone will break into the house then have the nerve to tell me that im inconsiderate and have an attitude. Yes my parents are the typical trump supporters who watch Fox News all fucking day and even have a portrait of him on the wall, I can never talk about my problems with them because they are slim to none to them, my dad always complains about his stress but when I bring mine up its nothing and “I dont know what stress is im to young to be stressed” they are on the verge of being complete narcissists, they always filp the problem on me and make me feel like a complete sack of shit, they’re always right and im always wrong because “they pay the bills” they can never have a civilized conversation and always turn to yelling at me and making me question everything im saying and thinking its pretty fucked. Any advice would help, idk what else to do."
relationship_advice,"I was deprived of attention and validation as a child, and now I constantly crave it from woman I get involved with or even those who show a slight amount of interest. It's starting to hurt my dating life.","So, yeah. Basically as the title says growing up as a kid I was pretty deprived of attention around the house and any real form of validation for most everything I did. My father was very stern and rarely showed much emotion about anything that didn't make him angry or dissatisfied, basically anything I did right (met a deadline, did a chore, clean up after myself, graduate high-school or college) was merely ""me doing what I was supposed to be doing"". On the other end of the spectrum was my mother who was basically gods angel (don't know how she puts up with my dad at times) the only problem was I picked up very young that a lot of enthusiasm, excitement, and praise she gave me was heavily exaggerated because she knew my dad was lacking greatly.

This got even worse as me and my siblings became much less close as we got older. My parents started expecting a certain level of obedience and compliance with a lot of things. Arguments got more intense with my parents as we began to be held more accountable as young teens, older brother (26) starts taking it out on me, younger sister (20) just basically withdrawals to remove herself from the line of fire for the most part. The validation thing went both ways, positive and negative, anytime there was an argument if I tried defending myself my dad would yell louder and become more intimidating (yes, he was physical at times so the effect was very real). When he was finished talking and his own temper wore his energy out then we weren't allowed to keep discussing it, I was never heard and often ended up in my room just kinda sad and emotional thinking it through my own head while my parents may or may not have been going for round 2 downstairs (most of which I heard clearly and was almost exclusively about my siblings or myself). Sometimes my mom would come up to check on me and console me or my siblings, but the fact she never demanded any change, apology, or at least making me heard from both parents made it feel like she was putting bandaids on a concussion. My dad never really cared to listen for the most part, outside of the handful of times I became extremely upset and he kinda sensed he was pushing me intensely.

It didn't get better as we grew into adulthood, I became much more aware of the middle child status. My dad was harder on my brother but he always seemed to take more priority on his mind, my sister was his little girl. I remember I once heard my parents half arguing downstairs and my dad said word for word ""I'm not worried about \*my brother\*, but \*me\* is the type of kid to get into drugs and all the other shit"". Neither of them know I was listening from my room but I haven't forgot that moment. A couple of months ago my sister casually mentioned the time my parents dropped her at the airport and the security officer was trying to make her laugh because her and my parents were all crying because she was leaving for studies. Twice before the age of 20 I left to work away for extended periods of time, both instances my mother was the only one taking me to the airport and seeing me onto my flight. I started trying to veer these problems towards friends for solutions here and there with little luck, my best friend switched schools after elementary and we didn't reconnect until after high school. That first year after he left was really hard for me, I didn't know many kids through sports or clubs and I got bullied for a bit trying to find a new group since everyone else seemed to instantly transition into new circles. 

This culminated in me becoming very cynical, disruptive in school, distrusting to even my friends (constant tests for loyalty, quick to cut ties), and eventually mental health problems that I didn't identify for another 4-5 years. I think my mom feels guilty now because she might have left me on the back burner and realized I was boiling a little late, but my dad is easier on me now, so that's nice. 

PRESENT DAY. I'm doing better but I've noticed more and more recently that I'm intensely craving the attention I get from woman. Anyone who shows interest instantly becomes a potential partner, even if a didn't really find them attractive or a suitable match beforehand. I'm becoming very impulsive and unpredictable with dating, and it's not good for me and not fair to all my romantic encounters. 

It wasn't always like this. For a while I gave up on woman since I was convinced they weren't interested in someone like me (again cynical, poor self-image). But a couple years after high school I lost some weight (decent amount for me given my height and build) and eventually started lifting some weights since it gave me more confidence and a bit of a fuck you card to throw at everyone who tore me down. Then I got rid of my beard.... and a switch kinda flipped into the shit storm of attention I seem to get now. I kept a decent size beard for what I would guess was 80% of the duration it took me to lose the weight and put on the muscle I have now, and once it was gone I quickly started to notice the amount of woman that seemed to constantly be looking at me. I thought my face was round my whole life but I discovered a fairly sturdy jaw and cheekbones, eyes hollowed and bit, and I guess people started looking at me differently. I thought it was all in my head till this one day waiting for a bus this quirky girl at my school flat out told me ""oh you're the cute guy all the girls were talking about in class"" ""oh don't get me wrong, you're a very attractive man, I'm just after someone else right now"" among other things. There was a guy sitting across from us there quietly waiting too, and I will NEVER forget the look on his face because we were both like WTF just happened. 

From there on things at least made sense, but I was having trouble adjusting. I was going to a small school in a small town and once I got back home to start working it grew exponentially. Anytime at the mall or somewhere in public I would look around and girls were always darting their eyes away, catching women of ALL ages almost gawking at me without them even realizing it at sometimes. I had a new appreciation for woman who complained about men being prude. This hasn't been sunshine and roses, I eventually experienced being used for sex and getting ghosted, I've become even more self-absorbed about my appearance whereas I used to not really care, I constantly wonder what a woman's intentions are and am more timid about being involved with someone. This leads to anxiety and insecurity in even the most casual of flings. The entire dynamic of my partner suddenly seeing me as out of their league and this thing to be had and not vice versa is difficult, draining, and sometimes downright uncomfortable. 

But really the hardest part is no matter what seems to happen I have this insatiable desire for the attention I get not matter the toll it takes on me. I don't even know why it just feels like a drug or getting Instagram likes. I'll stay at the gym longer because I know there's girls looking at me (I literally used to dream about this, and now it's a fairly common occurrence), I'll reroute to take a busier path, and just overall crave the looks the thought I'd never get as a teen. It honestly sounds so egotistical but that's just my life now. I don't know if it's normal, or how one goes around this to develop deep meaningful relationships with a SO. I feel like the popular or attractive people who grew into this learn how to manage, but this all was almost thrust onto me and is still kinda fresh.

Taking into the account the background I tried my best to convey, how can one deal with this to make dating and relationships more manageable for both parties, ? Any advice is appreciated."
relationship_advice,I (19f) can't look at my friend (20m) in the eyes,"Back story: I knew him when i was younger and had a huge crush on him. But him being older. He went on to highschool while I stayed in middle school and with time i completely forgot about him. It's been a good 7 ish years and we've reconnected nearly a month ago and have been talking daily. We have become great friends and, I may have some growing feelings for him (but that is a post for another time)

We get along fucking great. We've hung out together but I just can't meet his eyes. He looks at me like he's looking into my soul. As if he truly gives a crap about what im talking about. I try to meet his eyes but everytime I do. I just look away or look down. I've never had a problem about looking someone in the eyes. I honestly have no clue on what to do."
relationship_advice,Should I air out my dirty laundry?,"Reddit, 

I’ve made some mistakes &amp; I need advice how to proceed. There’s a lot of backstory so let me know if anything’s confusing. (All of us in this story are late 20s). I have been dating Randy for about 8 months now. I love him more than anything &amp; he’s one of the best people I know. We met in college originally &amp; we were just friends then. He moved out of state after college then moved back to the area before we started dating. 

So my freshman year of college I met my friend Eliza. She was talking to this guy named Jack at the time. Never in a relationship just talking/hanging out (they both had SO’s at the time). That summer they didn’t talk &amp; came back to school with different SO’s, but again they started talking/hanging out some. Since Eliza &amp; Jack hung out some, I got close to Jack. Jack &amp; Randy were in the same friend group but I would never really consider them friends (I don’t think Randy particularly cared for Jack). Jack &amp; I ended up becoming roommates the following year with another guy, while Eliza transferred to a school back home (about 3 hours away). Jack &amp; I were really good friends in college. Eliza &amp; I still talked some but not a lot. 

About a year after college, Eliza &amp; I both were ending separate relationships at the same time. We kind of bonded over that &amp; hung out a few times after that even though she lived a couple hours away. She &amp; Jack started talking/hanging out some, but again not serious. Then she started a new relationship with someone else (the love of her life kind of thing, moved across the country with him). About a year after her &amp; her new boyfriend were together, Jack &amp; I drunkenly had sex. We had kind of flirted/made out a couple times in the months before that. But he didn’t live in the area so it wasn’t ever anything serious. I was really ashamed about this &amp; didn’t talk to anyone about it. I thought about telling Eliza, but since her &amp; Jack weren’t ever serious, I told myself she wouldn’t care. I’m not exactly certain about Eliza &amp; Jack’s physical relationship from the past but I’m sure they slept together a few times. 

Eliza &amp; I have become pretty close in the time since then, &amp; I have been feeling guilty about never telling her about Jack &amp; I. Ive been feeling especially guilty about not having told Randy. The thing with Jack &amp; I happened about 2 years before Randy &amp; I started dating. But since Jack is someone Randy knows, I feel guilty not  telling him. Even though Randy or I don’t talk to Jack anymore. However we did see him at a wedding a few months ago.  I just want to be open with him about my past &amp; not keep secrets from him. 

So reddit, I need advice. I’ve decided I’m going to tell Randy. This has really been eating at me. Would you guys tell Randy in this situation &amp; how? Then should I tell Eliza? Am I overthinking this way too much? Please give me your advice/suggestions. 

Tl;dr Should I tell my boyfriend &amp; good friend about the one night stand I had a few years ago with a close friend? (Before I was with my BF)"
relationship_advice,I feel bad for asking for some personal space but I desperately need it,"I’ve been together with my gf for over a year now and we’ve recently both started living on campus. This was a huge deal until we started doing everything together to the point where she just automatically assumed that I was hers all day after classes were over. Once her roommate left to go back home to a new college she started begging me to sleep over at her dorm which I did because I liked the idea at first, but now I can’t live a second of my life without her with me. I wouldn’t really complain except she won’t let me do anything by myself. If I ask or say that I want to go to the gym she gets all weird and sad and I end up not going unless I get lucky and she’s stuck at work long enough for me to go. I just want to have maybe an hour of my life for myself aside from when I’m in class but she cries the moment I bring anything up. Can someone help, I love her so much and it’s killing me to see her get so emotional for asking to be alone for a small amount of time"

i want to give him something special, bc i’m a pretty sentimental/sappy person, and my idea was to make a scrap book of all the pictures we have together (there are a LOT. we met in a travel program that we’re still currently in) however- we really only have been dating for 3 months, “courting” for about 6.  

would you all go screaming and running for the hills if you recieved a gift like this this early?? do you have alternative suggestions? he’s really into cinematography, photography, anarchy, punk music (nothing/nowhere), and psychedelics."
relationship_advice,My bf is insecure,"I (f16) just realised my bf (m16) of 3 months is rlly insecure. I just realised because he said that i dint give him enough attention/ affection.

relationship_advice,I'm (27m) afraid to initiate sex because my girlfriend (27f) has a low sex drive.,"I've been close friends with this girl for over 10 years, but we only started dating recently. I know from being her friend for so long that she has always had a low sex drive. She's told me that she's never had a sexual dream or fantasy, and when we have intimate conversations about sex (e.g. kinks), she'll say something like ""I don't know, I have a low sex drive.""

Because of this, I'm afraid to initiate sex. Am I overthinking it? How common is this?"
relationship_advice,How much complaining is too much?,"I (22f) have been with my bf (22m) for 2 years. From the beginning he has always been the type to complain/be negative more than I'm used to but it was never bad enough to get to me that much and I was able to listen and talk to him about things. Now for the past 6 months his negative attitude and complaining has almost ruined our relationship. He's even started seeing a therapist to help which is good but it still happens Andi don't know what to do anymore. 

I know you should be able to complain and vent to your partner and when I've told him that all his complaining is starting to affect me he made me feel kind of guilty by saying ""I thought youd be the one person I could talk to"" and he's right and I always have been but I think that it's at a level of complaining that is just unfair to me now and not the normal amount of venting a relationship should have.

I want to know how much complaining would be too much for you?"

relationship_advice,I (23) woke up to my sister (27) trying to suck on my toes,"In 2015, I went over to spend the holidays with my sister. During that time she was living with a verbally abusive (which I was completely unaware of until a few days into my visit). My visit was highly unpleasant and I basically just stayed the guest room the entire time I was there, as it was impossible for me to leave sooner.

The night before I left my sister decided to sleep in the same bed with me, which had never happened over my visit. During the night, I felt someone’s mouth go over my toes multiple times but didn’t know what was going on. However, while this was going on, I kept hearing a light banging noise. That was when I peaked out from under the blanket and noticed that my sister was sucking my toes (she had her face covered with a little mask) while someone was on video camera watching. I was so taken aback that I just froze and laid there, slightly kicking at her head. This went on for maybe 10 minutes, when I guess she figured out that I was awake and grabbed her phone and left without saying a word.

I felt so violated by it but still didn’t even understand what happened and we never spoke about it. About a week after I left I decided to message her to ask about it. She gave me this flimsy excuse that she was trying to cover her head with the blanket but I kept kicking her. She seemed very embarrassed and apologized, which verified my belief that she was lying to me. Why would you seem embarrassed about sharing a blanket. Again I just accepted her reason and never spoke about it again

But I think what she did fucked me up to some extent. I’m so paranoid about trusting people (if my own sister could do something like that to me).
And I’m also very conflicted as to whether what she did was wrong or if I deserve to be angry over it. My question is, should I approach her about it again, or just leave the matter alone and try to move on.

Any input will be greatly appreciated!

TLDR: woke up to sister sucking on my toes while on video chat with someone who was watching it. Confronted her but she lied about it.  Am I right in feeling violated and should I bring it up again or just move on?"
relationship_advice,"how do you respond to, or cope with, someone who threatens to withdraw from you at any criticism?","I'm talking about a situation where it feels like there is no security in their love for you because they yank it away if you have criticised them. the person I have in mind is overwhelmed (legitimately) by a lot of other things in their life, so they want to be in denial about the problems in the relationship.

relationship_advice,How do I [26M] keep my own lack of experience from being a red flag?,"So for the first time in a long time im feeling confident enough to try to put myself out there and try to start dating.

Ive been on exactly one date in my life, never been in a relationship, have never kissed a woman, much less anything else.

I don't want to lie about this if it comes up, nor do I want to use it as an excuse for being a bad date. But I guess I'm afraid that some people might take it as a sign that there's something wrong with me to have gotten to this age with nil romantic experience. 

Like how do I tell a woman that if she kissed me, it would be my first kiss, without making her feel weird about it? Do I just avoid it and pretend I know what Im doing?

We’ve been talking way more lately and I don’t know if I should ruin this friendship by confessing my love and interest for her.The issue is that she’s a very accomplished woman , she’s pursuing a graduate degree and she’s doing great financially and in general she’s in a better place than I am .What I want to say is that I’m really not in her league.I haven’t branched out as I just finished college and I still live with my family oh and I don’t have a job yet and I certainly not the money. I don’t know her well enough to know if she cares about any of that.I’m asking for advice because I’ve had similar situations before and I’ve been rejected twice and it ruined me. I have no idea if she feels the same way and I’m very afraid to ask.I certainly don’t want our relationship to be weird if end up asking.Should I confess my feelings to her or just forget about it.Is it the right move ? Or should I do something different?"
relationship_advice,Male infertility,"I am 39f and my husband is 51, married for 5 years.   Husband had a vasectomy when he was younger,  and then had a reversal when he was married to his second wife.  Because of the vasectomy reversal,  he has low sperm and motility. All my tests are normal.  We have been trying naturally for over 2 years, and were not successful.  I want to pursue iui because there is a good chance that it might work.  He is against iui, ivf, and adoption. He says that if it happens naturally or if it doesn't he's ok with that.  I want to move forward medically,  but he doesn't.  I told him that it is a deal breaker for me.  We do have a good marriage, he treats me with respect and I do the same.  He says that my depression is hindering me looking past having a baby,  and that I need to  overcome it.   He said that once I do that, I will see that we will have a good life even if we don't conceive.  I can't do that.  My dream is to try everything possible to conceive, and having a baby is something I have always dreamed of. We went to marriage counseling and basically since we are at a road block,  and not on the same page to try medical interventions, the therapist said it wouldn't be beneficial to continue therapy.  We need to be on the same page on having children.  Im going through the ups and downs of different emotions.  I know that if i stay,  i will regret my husband for not  trying harder.  I know I can't change him.  I can only change myself.  How do I move forward? Divorce him?  Am I being reasonable? Is this a reason to divorce?"
relationship_advice,would it be a wise decision to just let this go? or should i reach out to him?,"tl;dr: he was really hot &amp; cold. told me he “didn’t like me as much as he thought he did” the day after we spent yet another weekend together, per his request. i was confused b/c he was essentially treating me like his gf w/o any commitment. i told him i couldn’t handle this kind of relationship as it made me 5x more anxious than i already was &amp; he didn’t really like me anyways, so i broke things off. he was extremely jealous during &amp; even after the relationship. our main issue was that neither of us communicated our feelings at all. i never knew where i stood w/ him &amp; was always confused. he at least apologized &amp; visited me in the hospital.
it’s been 2.5 months since i ended things &amp; 3 weeks since i’ve gone nc, but my feelings for him haven’t dwindled. i’ve given up on having any romantic relationship w/ him. should i reach out to him? at the very least for a friendship? or is that a bad idea &amp; i should just leave it alone?

i’ll warn you now, i get very detailed so this is quite a long read.

i had a brief (about 1.5-2 months), mainly sexual, relationship w/ my neighbor. i met him through my roommate &amp; her bf, since they’d hang out in a group often. i (20F) hadn’t meant for the relationship to be sexual; &amp; he (24M) was originally asking me to be his gf right away, but i told him i wasn’t ready quite yet b/c i was recently getting out of an almost 2-year relationship &amp; i actually liked him so i didn’t just want it to be a rebound out of respect for him.
a couple weeks later, he suddenly changed his tune &amp; insinuated he wanted things to stay as they were *for now* (this was after we’d slept together at least once); &amp; i told him that was fine, thinking i could handle it without getting too attached (big mistake). 
in the small amount of time i’d spent w/ him, he introduced me to literally all his friends &amp; would ask me to spend almost every weekend w/ him (sometimes even until Monday or Tuesday). sometimes i’d just come in his room or common area to smoke since his roommates didn’t care &amp; i couldn’t in mine (i lived w/ my ra &amp; the girls i lived w/ didn’t smoke or like the smell); even when i didn’t intend to stay, he’d end up falling asleep on me or asking me to stay the night. 

the good: i ended up really enjoying the time we spent together &amp; liking him way more than expected. he’d do very little things &amp; notice things about me that i always wanted past boyfriends to notice but never did. i’ve had an ed for a few years, &amp; he’s the only guy that ever noticed how little i eat (i was mortified when he mentioned it). he once jokingly asked if anyone has ever told me i’m clumsy, to which i replied of course lol. he was really hard on me to get my homework done when i was w/ him because being w/ him was the only time i ever got any of it done, as i didn’t know at the time that i have adhd &amp; could never focus on my own; i’m very appreciative b/c he didn’t have to, but he made it a point to help me &amp; remind me of my deadlines or important things i needed to get done. he’d even tell me we couldn’t hang out unless i got an assignment done to motivate me. he’s the only guy, so far at least, that i’ve ever been able to sit in comfortable silence w/ &amp; not have this nagging feeling that something is wrong. he’s a quiet type who had this surprisingly deep voice, which attracted me to him. we’re both introverts, &amp; we have very similar taste in music. it’s also a plus that his mother was a stay at home parent &amp; i really love traditional things like that b/c i envision this for my own future, so i seek partners who are open to that. he was also verrrryyyyy affectionate, i’m not someone who initiates physical touch a lot so i noticed he initiated it a lot. even when we got intimate, he was extremely affectionate.

the bad: he’d do this thing where he’d ask me to spend time w/ him, but then would go cold or distant immediately after. he seemed to have a lot of trouble talking about himself, so getting to know him was hard. i had to find ways to trick him into telling me about himself, &amp; it became exhausting. i still feel like i don’t know very much about him, &amp; one of his closest friends (our one mutual friend) feels the same way. he admitted once that he’s always worrying &amp; has many negative thoughts. he’d also say things about him being ugly or wondering why i thought he was cute (he‘s actually quite handsome imo), he had a hard time accepting compliments. i could just tell he was very insecure. he also liked to trip on acid w/ his friends, which i’m not judging him for, but i didn’t particularly like it either. his main group of friends (besides maybe 2-3 of them) were also very hostile towards me, for what reason i still don’t know. his other friends &amp; closest friends were nice though. he also had this habit of being incredibly jealous, i was honest that i was still dating as i would get offers to go out &amp; he wasn’t making things exclusive nor was he taking me out yet he’d still get jealous. even after i ended things romantically, he’d get jealous if i was talking or laughing w/ another guy while he was around. he even told our mutual friend not to “let” one of their other friends sleep w/ me after he noticed we we had a convo &amp; i was laughing a lot (i noticed him staring at me as this happened &amp; some friends said they did too).

because of all this confusion &amp; the fact that i was emotionally unstable at the time, i’d find myself getting extremely depressed when i thought about him or our relationship. i’d get unrecognizably angry at false arguments i literally created in my mind. i’d get angry thinking he was just a manipulative pos, &amp; then i’d get sad telling myself he’s just a poor insecure soul. sometimes both these emotions would happen in the span of an hour. 

one night, directly after i’d spent the weekend w/ him *per his request,* we had a long conversation b/c i had been feeling extremely anxious &amp; stressed about where i stood w/ him. i could no longer handle being in what was basically an entire relationship disguised as a fwb relationship. i’ve never been comfortable sleeping w/ a man w/o any kind of commitment or at least some confirmation that we were getting somewhere at least somewhat serious. he seemed to be under the impression that i wanted him to be my bf &amp; he’d insinuate that he wasn’t ready, but all i wanted was to know that he could at least envision a serious relationship w/ me &amp; not date or sleep w/ anyone else. he barely spoke, but said he was confused because he’s never been in a relationship so he’s having a lot of new feelings he doesn’t understand. he also said something about not knowing if he wanted to be in a relationship w/ me. then he said something like “i just don’t know if i like you as much as i thought,” &amp; i was so devastated i vowed to end things there b/c i felt bamboozled. he tried to make up for it by reminding me that i’d always “be special” to him since i was his “first.”
then there was thanksgiving break, where i didn’t talk to him at all. he hmu a few days before we got back to school saying he missed me &amp; wanted to hang out the night after he got back, so i said yes w/ the understanding that it was just hanging out since i had told him in our last convo that i was no longer giving him romantic benefits. 
the night comes, he comes over, &amp; proceeds to be ridiculously romantic the entire time he’s there. asking me to sit on his lap when i pulled up a chair, kissing me (i admit, i shouldn’t have given in, but i was emotionally vulnerable &amp; still a people pleaser), &amp; then trying to sleep w/ me. i said no, &amp; when he asked “i really can’t have you?” i asked him if he at all remember our last serious convo, to which he replied “no, i don’t remember.” i’m still not sure if this was a complete lie or he meant it. i reminded him i wasn’t comfortable w/ such a casual sexual relationship. he then proceeds to tell me, after taking a moment to think, that he’d be *willing* to commit on *his* terms. i said no of course, cuz it was clear he was just saying whatever he could to get me in bed &amp; his “offer” was incredibly selfish. he then kissed me, i presume as a way to shut me up.
i eventually gave in (stupid me) &amp; we got intimate, but i stopped him before we could go as far as having sex. he cuddled w/ me for a bit until my roommate came back, then left. i was extremely confused after b/c none of that was supposed to happen &amp; i distinctly remember telling him i didn’t wanna do any of this in our conversation before break. 
the very next day, i told him that wasn’t happening again &amp; i’m sick of stressing myself out over a guy who clearly doesn’t seem to want to be my bf. i didn’t look at him very much, but i do remember him having this kinda smirk on his face (still not sure if he’s a lowkey narc, or it was just nervous laughter) &amp; all he responded w/ was “okay.” he then proceeded to do that thing of being jealous if i talked to a guy while i was hanging out w/ my roommate while she was in their friends’ common area &amp; he was there.

the last month of the semester, i’d sometimes see him around &amp; be cordial. whenever we hung out in the guys’ common area at the same time, we’d talk to everyone else but each other. there was a night where we went to the dining hall at the same time &amp; he asked if i wanted to sit w/ him, i said yes so as to “not be rude” (remember, i was still a people pleaser); but when a friend joined us, we did this strange thing of ignoring each other &amp; focusing entirely on the other person.

this was all before i lost my mind &amp; no longer felt safe alone after my roommate flew back home since she didn’t have any finals, as i’d been trying to keep things together w/ my untreated depression. it was to the point where i was missing exams b/c i’d show up still crying &amp; couldn’t get myself to stop. i went to the counseling center after calling the hotline &amp; they called an ambulance, so i ended up in the hospital for a week. i’d texted him the night before i left as i was so lonely &amp; just wanted a reason to stop crying, but he didn’t respond. a mutual friend ended up telling him (even though i said not to) when he asked about me, &amp; our friend kept telling me to just give him a chance to talk about me b/c he cared. i didn’t think he cared past his own guilt, but i gave him the chance to apologize since i wanted to hear it.
he did apologize, &amp; told me he was confused himself &amp; has also been struggling w/ depression. he told me that although he does feel guilt, it doesn’t mean he’s acting entirely out of guilt &amp; that he really does care. he said he’d visit me, &amp; came w/ our friend which was nice. he didn’t talk much, but we played some games. he mostly listened as i talked to our friend &amp; would chime in here or there. there was a moment where we locked eyes &amp; there was that strong chemistry again. he’d talk to me every day while i was there. soon after, we’d talk less &amp; less until eventually all i’d get from him were meaningless snapchats. 

since leaving the hospital, i’ve been in therapy, have been actively working on self-love, &amp; healing. i’m nowhere near where i want to be, but i know i’m getting there. i’ve at least recognized many faults that were hurting me in my life &amp; relationships. i’ve been stopping bad habits &amp; changing negative thoughts/behaviors.
i know now that he was not the only person bad at communicating his feelings b/c i never told him how anxious i felt either. i also realized i have this terrible habit of impulsively ending relationships once i’m angry enough to do so, as this was also how i ended my long-term relationship (&amp; truthfully, every relationship before it). i never let anyone break up w/ me b/c i absolutely can’t stand to be abandoned, so i run before the other person has the chance to; my attachment style is insecure.

i still finding myself missing him these days, even after reflecting on the relationship. it’s been almost 2.5 months since i ended things &amp; 3 weeks since i told him to stop contacting me (so i could properly heal). somehow, i have more feelings for him than i do for the guy i was w/ for almost 2 whole years &amp; i don’t understand it. my feelings haven’t dwindled much at all. all my friends keep telling me i need to leave it alone, that he’s not good for me, that he’s a manipulative pos; &amp; i believe them to a degree, yet still i miss him. i still wonder if he really did just feel guilty or if he really cared. i find myself still wanting to talk to him despite understanding it’s probably not good for me since if he really wanted me, he’d have come around or at least tried to talk to me even before i went nc. even despite convincing myself that 9x out of 10, he probably doesn’t feel the same.
i guess i’m wondering if my feelings are worth reaching out to him (of course, once i’m feeling more confident about it) &amp; at the very least trying to develop a friendship, as i don’t think either of us are in the place for romantic relationships now. or would it just be a bad idea?"
relationship_advice,How do I (25M) tell my wife (36F) I don’t feel loved?,"Preface: I love my wife. I am IN LOVE with my wife. I have no intention or thoughts of ever leaving my wife. 

How do I tell my wife I don’t feel loved? The past few months have been super rough. A combination of my recent harsh, inconsistent working hours while also traveling around the country for work, some family drama on her end, not to mention our pregnancy and our current living situation which forces us to live in separate states. I visit on the weekends, holidays, whenever I can. 

I do my best to be the strong one. I want to be strong for her, I want to be a rock for her. It’s tougher on her than it is me. Our son will be here soon, and I’m so excited. I’m happy. But the past few months have just worn me down. I haven’t felt loved or cared about for a while. And now it seems like I can’t even talk to her without saying something that pisses her off. Everything just seems to end with her mad, and I’m so tired. On a fundamental, soul level, I am so tired. 

I wanna bring this up to her, but I’m at a loss for a constructive way that doesn’t end up with me back at square one in the dog house. She’s not always like this, I attribute most of it to her being pregnant as well as our situation wearing on her too. I’m not even sure I should bring it up, maybe try to tough it out a few more weeks till our little guy gets here. 

Help?"
relationship_advice,"My (m35) partner f(29) has suffered anxiety most of our relationship, and it’s making me confused about her feelings for me","I think she is a wonderful partner and frankly I’d love to propose to her. We’ve been together just over 2 years and we understand each other better than I ever thought would be possible. 

But there’s one thing. For 90% of our relationship she’s struggled with anxiety, some ocd, insomnia, and started taking an Anti-depressant to help. I’m honestly ok with this and I’ve tried to be as supportive as possible. 

I say 90% of the time because the anxiety started a few months into our relationship when she went through a few difficult life events. As I said this doesn’t bother me, but for most of our relationship I’ve also felt that strong physical desire isn’t there from her. We still fool around, but there’s not a strong desire from her and I often feel like she does it because that’s what a good partner should do. At the very beginning of our relationship she seemed to desire me a lot more and everything was fine. 

She wants us to get married too, but desire is really critical for me and I don’t want to commit to someone unless I know they desire me. 

I tried talking to her and she says she does desire me but is going through a hard time and that I should just trust her, but I feel like I need to really feel it myself. How can I say this to her without making her feel like she’s at fault for having anxiety or taking medication? I don’t want to put pressure on her to fix something like anxiety when i know it’s difficult to fix. Am I being an asshole for not being able to take her word that she desires me? 

If everything else is perfect, am I being crazy to hold out on something that might be a total non issue?"
relationship_advice,Why do I miss my ex so much?,"Why do I miss my ex so much?

I am 29m and she is 26f and we broke up about a year ago after a 6 year relationship and went straight into a relationship with her work collegue, literally, I came back early from a hunting trip and I caught them having sex in our bed and she is still with him to this day. We have a child together which also makes things akward when I pick her up but its something that I have put behind me now and just accepted so I can focus on my daughter.

Anyway to the meat of the story, a few times a week I find myself thinking of my ex and the good times we had together. I find myself driving past places we used to hang out and cuddle/kiss.

I should be happy that shes not in my life anymore but even a year after we broke up I still miss her and I dont know why but one thought could be because she was my love of my life and that was the best 6 years of my life I have had before.

Is this normal to feel like this after such a long time of being seperated?"
relationship_advice,My (21M) girlfriend (20F) has gotten a bigger work load at school and I am overthinking things.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 5 months and up until she started this semester we were talking on the phone, texting, and/or hanging out everyday. Now that she is busier she does not have as much time for those things anymore and it seems getting a phone call is rare. I know that it is not her fault and feel for her. It is just that my stupid brain keeps whispering terrible things to me like, ""What if she doesn't love me as much anymore."" or ""What if she wants to break up with me."" It is honestly eating me alive and I cannot help it. I love her so much and I feel like this is only going to hurt our relationship if I can't get my mind right. I have already told her kind of how I am feeling and she told me that she has adverse reactions when she is under a lot of stress. I feel like me being like this is only going to cause her more stress and make her more distant. Please somebody help me get over this so I can feel normal again. I love her so much and do not wanna lose her.

TL;DR - I am overthinking about not getting to talk to/see my gf as much and it is giving me incredible anxiety. Need advice on not overthinking."
relationship_advice,And just like that she’s done,You have 3 days left with the love of your life and after that it’s goodbye.... what would you say? I’m currently in the situation.
relationship_advice,"[M29] my gf [F32] doesn't initiate to meet up unless it's an errand, and seem distracted on calls, and in a hurry to end calls on days we haven't talked all day...","I don't want to be a pest or ask for attention. I hate asking for things like that, that would seem normal in a relationship.

In the beginning of the relationship, I brought up her not texting me after she returns from work, and she said she'd try harder during non-work hours...but later snapped at me that I expect her to text me while she's at work even though i made it clear that I was talking about non-working hours. So I've been hesitant to bring things up it again.

We have a good sex life. I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but according to her the best sex life she had with a significant other. Even with that, I feel like I am the only one that ever initiates. 

Sometimes we can't meet and it would get heated during a phone call or text, and I would joke about sending nudes. She made it clear that she would never do that, which I respect... BUT She would bring up the fact that she had no sex life with her ex, and would have to initiate each time, and she'd do things like send him nudes to get him going. They'd have sex once a week or once a month. It made me feel like she doesn't trust me as much.. 

She says things like this is the most healthiest and the most stable relationship she's had...but at time I don't feel wanted and that I'm just here because I am a ""Safe"" choice...Idk what to think. I try to keep it to myself because a lot of these thoughts are just thoughts, and insecurities. Part me thinks they are valid. I don't know if it's me being insecure...or just needy. It's a weird place."
relationship_advice,I’m in the friend zone with a girl whose boyfriend cheated on her,"
A girl friend zoned me a couple months ago because I waited too long to tell her how I felt. She’s back with her ex but I feel like she’s still being kind of flirty and playful. She’s an amazing person that fits me perfectly and this might just be because I don’t have another perspective, but the guy she’s with was terrible to her and idk what to do. I don’t want to break them up because that’s terrible for both of them. She obviously still loves him, but she’s my favorite person in the world and this guy absolutely screwed her over. Is there a way I can win her over without being a douche?"
relationship_advice,My girlfriend's [23/F] friend [23/M] only contacts her when he wants/needs something from her.,"Hi, my girlfriend is the nicest, sweets person I've known for the last 4 years. However, she has the tendency to be a walking mat for people because she is afraid to upset anyone. She also tends to not believe me when I warn her about people's ill intentions until it's too late... this happens a lot.

In this case it is a ""friend"" of hers she met at science camp maybe four or five years ago. Since then they kept in loose contact over the phone once or twice a year. My girlfriend is an artist and an introvert with very little friends (close to none). 

Anyway, this particular guy is a wannabe rapper who often has new singles or albums coming out. Every time he does, I've noticed he will contact my girlfriend a week before to just ""catch up"". The following week he will ask her to do art for him for free which my girlfriend will graciously agree to and spend a whole week stressing over.  

Of course, when I tell her this, she doesn't believe me and it is quite irritating. How do i do this without out appearing jealous? I just think if he's a struggling artist, he can support her too by offering to pay her (more than 20$.. which is what he offered the one time i pressured her to charge him after his 5th free project).

Am I wrong for being irritated about this?"

relationship_advice,Me (20M) &amp; the busy gf (19F),"(I'm not good at titles)

I'll skip the details as they aren't relevant, but my girlfriend of about a month has started the semester and is floored busy both mentally and physically. We've had a couple dates scheduled recently, but she's had to cancel for one reason or another. Completely fine with this as some things can't be helped. We don't really chat much over text, which I'm a little disappointed about since I tend to text more, but it's fine. Anyways, I'm only doing a tax co-op this semester, so I have a decent amount of free time after work (for now at least, the dreaded tax season cometh lol). 

She said recently that she's thinking that she's too busy to have a relationship, which I get, but at the same time I think we can work through it. I say this because before she got super busy, we were getting along great, two peas in a pod. We also live about 30ish minutes from each other. I imagine this is just a rough patch for her right now, and I want to help her through it. On top of being busy, she's said that a lot of friends come to her with their problems, so there's lots of drama too.

What I'd like are some suggestions for things I might not have thought of to help her out. Trying to be supportive in her time of need. I would hate for this relationship to not work out because she's too busy."

relationship_advice,Should I (18M) reach out to and meet up with my old French teacher (26F)? Or would that be inappropriate and awkward? What should I do?,"Back in my junior year, I had an amazing French teacher. She had a lasting effect on all of us, and me especially. Every now and then we email each other. Her passion, knowledge, joy, and teaching skills influenced me to consider majoring in French in college. Unfortunately, I didn't choose to major in French, although I still love what I'm majoring in. Anyway, while it had nothing at all to do with my choice of school, I actually just realized that my old teacher lives near where I am currently at school and also went to the same school I am at. We were very, very close a few years ago. She helped me through some hard times during my junior year, she wrote my college letter of rec, I planned a going away gift for her, etc. While I'd love to be able to see and talk to her again, I'm not sure if that would be awkward, inappropriate, etc. I'm unsure if that fact that I am an 18 year old man and she is a 26 year old women makes it any worse, but I figure it might be helpful to know that for teachers on Reddit who can comment and respond to this post. I want to be clear as possible that there's nothing weird between us and I don't have any weird feelings for her or anything like that... unless its weird for a former teacher and a former student to still stay in touch every now and then via email. I'm simply hoping that we can get together again at some point.

My question is whether or not it is appropriate or awkward if I try to reach out and ask her if she'd be interested in meeting up. Unfortunately, it may not be acceptable by social norms for something like this to happen, and that's why I'm asking. What would you say? Should I do it or not? If so, how would you go about doing it? How can I make it not look awkward and just be normal? or is that not a possibility? I'm just interested in what your ideas and advice and tips about this are. Please don't be afraid to be brutally honest, I can handle the truth. Thank you very much!"

relationship_advice,Is it controlling for me [F/30] to not want my boyfriend [M/27] to become friends and hang out alone with my sister [F/27] ?,"So I've been seeing my boyfriend for almost 6 months now and we are very much in love and getting quite serious (moving in with each other soon). I recently moved country and he is back in my home country waiting to get a job to move here and be with me. We see each other every 2-3 weeks.

When I was still back home I lived with my sister and we would hang out the 3 of us all the time. She's like my best friend and her and my bf got along great. The thing is, since I moved away they've hung out a couple times without me and it's starting to make me feel uncomfortable. I have no problem with them getting along or being close but I'd prefer if it was while I'm around. Or at least once me and him have built our relationship more maybe then it will be natural for them to get close but right now I don't like it. He recently wanted to do yoga with her (which is something me and him do together) and it really bothered me that they would be hanging out just the two of them and doing this physical activity. Especially because me and him kinda associate yoga with sex quite a bit :-/

They are the same age and do have a lot in common - I guess I just don't want to see them doing things that I would want to do with him myself. And I don't want them to become super close as I feel it could negatively affect mine and his relationship or mine and my sisters. I told my sister and she was so understanding and great about it but it recently came out between me and my bf and he was NOT happy and thought that i was being controlling. He actually seemed way too angry to me - saying stuff like he had invested time and effort into building a friendship with my sister and that it's now wasted and that it will be hard for him to be normal around her now because he's afraid of what I'll be thinking. He said I either need to set the boundary and kind of ruin the relationship the 3 of us used to have OR lift the boundary but that means he should be able to hang out with her as much as he wants.

FYI: my sister and I are very similar in personality, dress style, attitude, etc. so I also feel weird that she probably will remind him of me and vice versa. It's all just too weird...

I don't want to be controlling I just want to set some boundaries! Am I crazy here?? Please help, I feel totally lost.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My bf wants to be friends with my sister but I don't like them hanging out alone and doing things I would do with him while I'm away in another country. She understands, he thinks I'm crazy - am I??"
relationship_advice,Mom’s boyfriend,"My parents have been separated for four years and I (20F) have had no contact with my father since. About two years ago my mom started dating a guy who I’m not comfortable with. He’s nice but he’s dismissive of my mental health, has no understanding or empathy for minorities (especially immigrants), and my mom seems to have made a sudden 180 in her opinions since dating him. We don’t really have a relationship as he lives about two hours away and he rarely makes the trip to see my mom and she spends all of her spare time with him. He has his own children who my mom has built a good relationship with but he does not seem to be trying with me and my sisters.  She has told me multiple times that she would break up with him for me, which I would never want her to, but I’m worried if I bring any of this up to her she will feel compelled to leave him or at least it will make her feel very guilty. I know if she was to break up with him, the rest of my family would blame me (they have done this many times before), because she deserves to be happy since she suffered a lot of abuse when she was married to my father. I know I will end up being guilted and have my feelings invalidated if this relationship ended but I finally realised my feelings are worth as much as anyone else’s and I have the right to be comfortable in my own home. I know I’m an adult but I don’t think anyone ever stops needing their mom. So, how can I bring this up to her without making her feel bad and sounding like an entitled brat who wants her mommy all to herself???"
relationship_advice,Advice I don’t know what happened NSFW,I don’t know where to put this but I feel like something happened. So I was talking to the guy who wanted to fool around and when we met up I said sure but I don’t want to go all the way. At least I think I said that. Well he said how do you feel about sucking dick. And I thinking he would try to please me as well said sure. So I take off my top and he’s not touching me he’s hard and I know he was into it because  I kept checking. He said so are you gonna suck my dick or not. I was like yeah but I want some pleasure as well. He wasn’t touching except for kissing. I told him when sucking dick I have to be in charge. He was pushing my head up and down it wasn’t forceful and I didn’t gag so I let him. Then I was like well maybe he’ll eat me out of run my clit so I took my pants off. He wasn’t even fully undressed just had his dick out. So I’m grinding on him and I fell a pressure and pain so I say again I don’t want to go all the way. And he said sorry and backed off. It wasn’t really going anywhere and I said is there anything you want me to do? And he said yeah I wanna fuck you but you don’t want that. And I don’t know how many times he said are you gonna suck mu dick or if it was just the once. He left didn’t finish I said i don’t think this is gonna work. He I think had rubbed my clit a little bit eventually. And I don’t know what that pressure was if it’s what I thought it was. Because I did consent so why do I feel dirty? Any advice is appreciated I’m 19 F.
relationship_advice,How do I hint that I want HIM to pay for the date?,"In dating this really nice guy, and he’s great in every way, except that I’m almost always the one paying for dates. When I say that I mean like, if we want to eat out I better have my money. 

This hasn’t caused any problems in our relationship because I make a lot more money than he does, so inevitably I pay more often. We don’t live together though, so it’s not like we have combined accounts/expenses. 

We planned a nice, semi-pricey valentine’s date (around maybe $80-$90 if we are pretty frivolous) and I would really like if he paid. I know it would not be a problem if I straight up told him, but I want it to not be completely my idea. Any ideas on how I can subtly hint that I want him to pay? 

Thank you!"
relationship_advice,Am I sabotaging my relationship?,"I’ve (21F) been with my boyfriend (21M) a year and a half. I’ve known him for almost 10 years now, and I love him with all my heart. We hope to get married in the next year or so. 

I’ve had an extremely difficult past year related to family issues, resulting in me cutting all ties with my family. He’s been with my through it all and has been nothing but supportive.

I do feel like I’m finally healing from everything that happened, but I go through periods where I revert back to depression. These dark feelings seem to escalate when I’m around my boyfriend. He does nothing to make me unhappy, but it is like a switch flips inside of me. I will be having a wonderful day, taking care of myself, and then he comes along and I become a depressed, irritable, overly sensitive mess.

I know my behavior is taking a toll on him and I do my best to control my emotions but they always seem to surface when he’s around. I’m wondering if it’s actually him that’s making me feel this way, or if I’m subconsciously feeling this way because over the past year he’s been the one to take care of me when I’m feeling depressed, anxious, etc. For example, my subconscious my might be saying “Ok, if I display feelings of hurt he will comfort me and make me feel better”. Or is this something between us and maybe signs of our relationship not being compatible? I worry because relationships are supposed to uplift you, not bring you down.

Anyways, not sure what I’m looking for by posting this but. If anyone has advice on how to handle, or if you’ve experienced something similar I’d love to hear it.

*also this is my first post on reddit so yay*

TL;DR: fear I might be subconsciously destroying my relationship. I’m unhappy whenever my bf is around. Is he making me unhappy or am I making myself unhappy?"
relationship_advice,I (27F) have been asked to be the maid of honor in my friend's (27F) wedding. How do I create boundaries around time and money spent?,"My close childhood friend has asked me to be her maid of honor in her wedding next year. I am excited to stand by her side and be involved in this special day, but I am dreading the time and financial commitments.

My boyfriend and I are not currently engaged because we don't want to spend the time or money planning a wedding at the moment. This is making me feel a bit resentful that I'll be spending both of these things on someone else's wedding. I have also never been in a wedding before, much less a maid of honor.

My friend and I live in different states, a flight apart, and I can already tell that she is going to be spending a lot of money on this event. I also work a job that is busy and tiring, and I hardly make time to plan things for myself. She is wildly picky, a huge planner, and a bit of a control freak. I am worried that whatever I feel comfortable dedicating to her shower and her bachelorette will not be what she is expecting, and she may take it as disinterest. 

What exactly is expected of a maid of honor, and how do I manage my friend's expectations while still supporting her? How can I make it out of this without spending too much of my own savings?"
relationship_advice,Thoughts on writing letters to people who hurt you?,"I'm thinking of sending letters to the people who have hurt me most in the past.

relationship_advice,My boyfriend didnt spend my 18th birthday with me,"Well today is my birthday. I'm 18 now and I think I need to get onto growing thick skin and start to not care about anything anymore because of what happened today.. please read and comment your thoughts.. 
I went up to school to spend lunchtime with my boyfriend (to give him a little surprise) and I also THOUGHT I was still enrolled (even though I havent been to school in 2 months. Yes I'm a dropout but havent done the process yet) I scanned in and my ID didnt go through. They took me off the list for the number of days I skipped. Now that I just found out, I texted him asking if he could ask to use the bathroom as an excuse to get out of class for a couple minutes to see me so I wouldn't just come up to the school for no reason.  He refused and said that being here just for lunch was weird. That made me angry and it made my attitude go up on its meter. He still kept refusing, saying he has to wait (he didnt even try to ask either). So I just decided to wait till next period (lunch) for him to meet me by the metal detectors.   Then I was kicked out by a really rude officer that didnt like me even when I was enrolled. 
I was sobbing in front of the school on the ground texting him saying stuff like how when his class is over to ""fucking get out here"" and telling him that I'm sobbing, and that im gonna be hurt if he doesnt and that we can grab lunch at my house. He used to leave school with me alot after lunch last year and sometimes before I dropped out. So yes, I was trying to convince him to leave school with me now because I was sobbing upset.. 
He called me and said that he was getting very annoyed and that his classes were more important. I still tried to convince him but I gave up and told him to enjoy the rest of his lunch period and I hung up and sobbed even more.. 
A few minutes later I done some thinking and I did realize that his classes were more important then leaving with me. I said I was so sorry and that it wasnt gonna happen again because I understood.. he declined my calls and didnt answer my messages of apology. (Which made me cry even more due to my overthinking and due to the fact he sits with his female ""friends"" at lunch who hate my guts for nothing) 
He then texted me later and said that he rather would hang out tmmw because he isn't in a good mental mood. 
I literally said: I understand babe but I wanna be there for you if your feeling like that. Your my baby. I'm sorry I was upset and told you to come out. Your classes are important and I wont do that again. I was just really upset that I was kicked out while I was trying to see you. I really miss you baby. And it makes me so upset that your not good and I wanna make you feel better.. 
He said.. ""Nah"" ""I wanna be alone today"" and I told him I respected that and that I love him.. and he said that he loves me too.."

relationship_advice,My[18M] girlfriends [18F] parents found out that we were dating and told her to stop talking to me and forced her to break up with me. We still have strong feelings for eachother. How should I approach this situation?,"Before I get started I’m sorry if this is structured badly I’m just letting my thoughts go 

Back story is me and this girl really like eachother, we secretly dated for just over 4 months. She knew that if her parents found out they would probably oppose the relationship, which was inevitable if we planned to hang out frequently. Her parents are of south Asian descent and have never met me in person or talked with me directly. She struggles with depression on top her workload of schoolwork(which is not too big but lack of motivation makes it big) and working at her parents business some days. I help her understand mathematical concepts that she is struggling with and help her with any school work that she is having trouble with. I am as passive and understanding as possible, without invading her personal space. I make sure she has little to know things preoccupying her before we hang out. 

In a nutshell, I am not negatively affecting her education in anyway, just benefiting it. Her parents say that she needs to “focus on her studies” but she is already excepted into university with very average marks that don’t require excessive time to maintain in hs. We are going to the same university (I was already going there, not because of her) so that may be a way to revitalize things, but that’s relatively far away. I’m just lost because we both like eachother and have time to spend with eachother, but her parents still disapprove and blame me for interfering."
relationship_advice,How do you start a “we should take a break” conversation?,"I need to take a break from my boyfriend because of some issues (check last post for details) and I’m hoping that us taking a break will help us both grow, and ultimately better our relationship. How does one start this conversation? I’m thinking about doing it over text cause we rarely see each other in person, unless we’re going out of our way for a date. 

Do I just start with “I think we need to go on a break...” or is it more of a “what would you think of us going on a break?”  Sorry I’m new to the whole relationship thing aha :)"
relationship_advice,My boyfriends been talking to someone else the whole tome we’ve been together. What do you make of this?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for one year. Our relationship has been very up and down. We went on multiple breaks and broke up and got back together at one point. We broke up for the second time two months ago; he ended it. This was the longest we’d been apart.

Last week we started talking again and I asked him if he’d been with anyone else. He said he had and it absolutely broke my heart. He felt so so awful. He ended things with her and we got back together.

However, the girl who he’d been seeing is someone he’s known the whole time we’ve been together. I’ve seen their messages and apparently they have a “special connection that neither of them have ever felt before”. He’d also been talking to her every time we’ve been on a break, and the also the last time we broke up. It was only this second time we broke up, that they actually started seeing each other.

What do you make of this? What is this thing between them? Would he do all of this if he truly loved me?"
relationship_advice,I (19F) found a reddit post made by my ex (20M) referencing me and now want to make contact,"Four months ago, my boyfriend of almost one year broke up with me. We had no particular reason to dislike one another and the breakup was hardly scandalous. He just decided he couldn’t deal with the distance anymore, and in the process completely broke me.

Stupidly, at first, I tried contacting him to try and work things out. He got annoyed at me and now I really regret ever doing that. So, I left him alone. Months passed and as new opportunities presented themselves, I slowly forgot my pain and, until a few days ago, would maybe only think of him in passing (but still daily).

This all changed when I was browsing another subreddit and saw an advice post that caught my eye. I scanned it and related to it heavily, to the point where it seemed spookily like me. So, I scrolled back up and it hit me. It was his username. The one he used for everything. I had found my exes post in ALL the posts I could’ve seen that day.

Now don’t get me wrong, in the post he said he thought he might have feelings for his flatmate (who I have known as long as him), which in some ways shocked me, some ways didn’t. But in it said the reason he hadn’t made a move was because he thought it might be a rebound. He said he’d been annoyed at me at the start of the breakup but since then had really missed me and thought about me daily. This confused me because he pushed me away so hard and made it seemed like he hated me so much that I almost can’t process he’d even thought about me in the last four months.

This is where my dilemma starts. I thought I was over him, I really did, but with all this time to process it I’ve realised that I really do miss him and would like to contact him. I know there’s probably no chance he wants to get back with me because it was his decision to breakup with me and he’s very stubborn when it comes to things like that. I’ve just always felt like our story was never over.

Do I message him out of the blue? If so, what do I even say? Does anyone else have a similar experience of this?

TL;DR- found my ex’s post on reddit saying he missed me. I’ve been missing him too and wondering if I should initiate contact, even though he thinks he might have feelings for someone else."
relationship_advice,Confused and hurt because I don't understand enough yet...,"I (25M) have recently started a long distance relationship with someone I met online (25F) (and yes I know how stupid this sounds I never believed in it before either but she is so close to the type of woman that I always described I wanted it's almost like I made her ""Weird Science"" style and I honestly just want to be there to support her through whatever for however long I can and she has admitted the same but we are both scared of how fast it's been going her a whole lot more than me because of her past and I am okay with that I am willing to take the risk but she keeps pulling away)and yes she is real we text, snapchat, and dm on discord, we even had a 4 hour skype call once but ""she hasn't felt like it since"" even though we both really enjoyed it I know I need to know more about this situation because she claims to be an EXTREMELY guarded woman and I have almost no experience with normal woman 😂😂 but anyways she has hidden absolutely nothing from me not even traumas she has been through that you would expect her to hide except for 1 thing.  I looked her up on facebook to add her and it said she was still with her ex-fiance she recently left because it was an unhealthy relationship.  A mutual online acquaintance of ours that I have known for 7 years now is the one who convinced her to leave so I believe she did.  But I saw that so I waited a few days and asked her about adding me she claimed she locked herself out of her account trying to remember her login information.  Okay thats fine but just 2 days later I get screenshots from my friends of her reacting to her exs posts and commenting about how they need that stuff for their house... I keep trusting her but a week later I lose it and confront her about it and she got really upset that I didn't trust her when I'm the only person she trusts she claimed that she really did lock herself out then but now has access again and they are just keeping everything as a cover for now so she doesn't have to deal with anything else from anymore people because she already has too much going on and noone to support her other than me who lives 12 hours away (which knowing what I do of her past and whats going on right now I can believe that) she also still communicates with her family even though they were the primary abusers and said that she told her mom about me and her mom hopes I don't break her heart like everyone else did So I apologized for not trusting her and after about a week that was what finally convinced her to send me an email of everything that she has been through in the past but now she just keeps getting more distant and I get another screenshot of them talking on his posts and just a few days ago she changed her cover photo to another one of them I can't tell if its an old photo because of the different camera angles but I still am trying to trust her because I truly do love her and I have been telling her that no matter what happens between the two of us I will always be there for her to support her.  I don't want to confront her again I really just want to trust her and part of me does but the other part of me is absolutely terrified to the point I'm having trouble sleeping because while I haven't been hurt in the past as she has I have still been hurt to the point that I was closed off to everyone including my own family and I've gone and completely opened up to her already.... The big issue for me right now other than the facebook is that the more she shares with me the more distant she becomes she has even stopped saying I love you lol I asked her about the distance and she said that while shes growing to share more with me shes also secluding herself I just really need some advice her should I just blindly trust her and give her space when she is being distant like I have been and still want to or what?  Honestly if she is getting back with him all I want is to know so that I can support her I just want her to be happy because she does deserve it I would like to be the one who makes her happy but if he is better for her so be it.
I just don't want to confront her again after what happened last time especially with how distant she is now and even if I did I wouldn't know where to begin...."

relationship_advice,[Repost] Am I to blame?,"Hi guys, Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Basically, My(21F) now ex boyfriend(24M) broke up this weekend, I’m unsure if It’s really my fault or if he’s overreacting. 

what happened was, A guy(20M) whom I was friends with &amp; shared mutual feelings with (Nothing ever happened or came of those feelings between us) Wanted to come back into my life, This person was a close friend to me once &amp; I enjoyed his friendship, I knew that my boyfriend may have an issue with it, So I told him in advance about this old friend showing up, He wasn’t worried at first. The next day 20M, Tried to flirt with me in my dms, I shut it down, Told him I respect my man too much to continue the friendship if he’s gonna continue to flirt, That I give my man my passwords for everything &amp; He will see this at one point. On a side note, I am a very loyal person, both of them know that. But anyways, My boyfriend did see &amp; Got very upset with me for still continuing the friendship even though the flirting had stopped and only occurred that once, He blamed me, Questioned me &amp; doubted me, I apologised because I realise that if I was in his shoes, I would be uncomfortable too, I then instantly ended the friendship with the 20M, Without any reason given. 

Fast forward a few days later, my now ex boyfriend and I were having a conversation, This Man’s name is mentioned &amp; my boyfriend begins attacking his character, calling him belittling terms, I didn’t disagree with my boyfriend, because again, I knew I would feel some way too if someone tried to flirt with him, however I refused to attack him with my boyfriend, I explained that yes, what he did was wrong, but it didn’t hurt our relationship &amp; I would never of allowed it, That he’s a good guy, or was in the past, he was also kind to me &amp; helped me during some bad times in my life, Which lead my boyfriend to feel as if I was defending him, So I explained further that I wasn’t going to attack someone who hasn’t caused any harm, Boyfriend now further angered, we’re on the verge of breaking up, I’m unsure what to do or say, Is he really going to leave me for not trash talking the man I so easily &amp; without second thought cut off for him? If so, Why? When he has a girl in his discord servers and on his friends list that he used to be romantically involved with but “had shut it down 3 years ago” even though she’s still tried things up until 2018ish which is when this guy and I we’re best friends &amp; had feelings for one another. I genuinely do feel that my boyfriend will make exceptions for himself but will instantly shame me for any mistakes or unforeseen Situations having occurred, But I do also feel that maybe I am in the wrong to not agree with my boyfriend, he has the right to feel upset by the situation, Does that warrant judging someone they don’t know &amp; putting them down? He thinks so, maybe he’s right, I’m unsure. 

I will also say when addressing this issue with my boyfriend, I was very calm, I was calling him baby, trying to calm him, explaining myself while also reassuring him, It didn’t seem to make any difference, Is it really that big of a deal to end a relationship? 

Any advice, opinion, or view point is welcomed &amp; appreciated"
relationship_advice,Asking for rent from bf...entitled ?,"So I bought a house. Yay me. My bf who barley works has decided he is going to live in my newly bought house. I added up the cost of bills taxes etc. Comes to 1200$ CAD a month. My rent previous was the same amount so I can afford my house myself. However I told him he would have to pay half to live in my house. He countered with it costs him too much in gas to get to work and if he can't get to work he can't pay me anything so I'm asking too much. Now before we see he's a dead beat..we have kid together. I knew enough to have my own place and pay for myself and child, he has helped with move and is handy with repairs. However I still feel that my house is not a free ride. Am I being entitled ? I kinda don't feel like I am but could use some other opinions. I was financially fortunate to be able to purchase the house upfront so no mortgage, so I think he feels he shouldn't have to pay rent because I don't technically have to pay monthly however there is expenses that are used such as gas hydro etc."
relationship_advice,I (19f) broke off friendships with my best friends because they were jealous and mean to my boyfriend but now I miss them and want to reach out.,"I had a really great group of best friends. We met in middle school and grew really close really fast. I loved them so much and thought we would be friends forever.

I started dating my boyfriend a little over a year ago. We have everything in common and are really compatible. I pretty quickly started to prioritize him over my friends. They got jealous, understandably, but they took it too far. They became passive aggressive with me, ignored me, and called my boyfriend offensive names as “jokes”. I was the only person in the group to have dated someone so they probably didn’t really understand how I could love my boyfriend more than them. We met up to try and resolve our issues after I voiced my anger with them. They apologized but said it was also my fault for not texting them or hanging out with them as much. I accepted what they said and we made up. They did not change their behavior after that and I realized they just wanted to put all the blame on me. 

A few weeks ago I cut them off. I told them I didn’t feel like I was treated fairly and neither was my boyfriend as he literally did nothing. They told me they felt like I didn’t care about our friendship anymore (despite never voicing any of their concerns with me) so we said goodbye and that was that. The problem is now I can’t get them out of my head. They were my only friends and I miss them. I don’t know if I made a mistake. I don’t want to forgive them for being mean to my boyfriend but maybe it’s all my fault to begin with for not paying attention to them. I want to reach out but I’m so conflicted. Is it worth it? I don’t know if I should forgive them or not. They might not change their behavior. 

TL;DR My friends got jealous that I was spending more time in my boyfriend so they became passive aggressive and mean to me and my boyfriend. I cut them off but I miss them now and am conflicted if I should reach out or not."
relationship_advice,"My (22F) boyfriend (29M) tells me it’s not okay for me to do something, but he does the same thing","A few weeks ago my boyfriend went on a short boys trip. For the most part, I like his friends, but he does have one I’m not a fan of. The day he left I asked him not to drink heavily while he’s away (he is kind of a mean drunk - usually very gentle and kind when sober, but drinking everything sets him off. I really didn’t want to deal with that behavior with so much space between us.) and he ignored the request. Night one, I can tell he’s drinking heavily already, he even says he’s pretty drunk. But things are fine and he’s acting normal so I just leave it. However, he told me it was a boys trip and that’s why I couldn’t tag along. Turns out his friend I don’t like invited girls out with them to the bar. This isn’t what concerned me. What did, however, was that he lied about it. He told me it was an all-boys group. I only found out because he accidentally flipped the camera in a video snapchat. Anyway, it was a fight, he called me a bunch of names and told me I was crazy and being irrational, I told him he was a liar and couldn’t even adhere to my most basic request not to drink heavily while out. The next day things are really tense between us, and that night he goes out with his friends again. Both nights they didn’t get back in until after 3 am. 

When he got back, he continued the shitty attitude and saying he did nothing wrong. After a while he apologized for lying and said he “realized he was in the wrong” but with no explanation of how he reached that conclusion. Fast forward to now...

In the morning I’m leaving to visit a friend for the weekend. Tonight she phoned me &amp; during our chat joked that we’d get blackout when I got there. After we hung up, my boyfriend said “I’d hope you don’t get blackout while you’re there.” And I asked him why, since I requested the same from him and he did it anyway, two nights in a row. He immediately got defensive saying “but I apologized. We already handled that, it’s over, and if you thought I was in the wrong why would you do the same thing?”

(It’s important to note that I would not get blackout in another city without my boyfriend. To be honest I wouldn’t do it at all. But out of respect for the relationship I would never do it without him. I have GAD and I know I handle those situations very poorly, I don’t think it’s worth making my partner uncomfortable for one or two fun nights.)

Anyway this became an argument. I think he only suddenly apologized because he got back home and his friends weren’t there to egg him on anymore and once removed from the situation, he realized I was going on a trip soon as well and could exhibit the same shitty behaviors. 

How do I approach the situation here? What do I say to make him understand my point of view? If he feels at all backed into a corner he goes on the defensive and shuts down/gets angry/starts yelling/etc. honestly he can be a real man child about a l o t of things, but I love him, and I’m trying to help him work on it. I just don’t think anyone had ever called him on his shit. 

Alternatively if I’m being an ass and I’m in the wrong, lmk."
relationship_advice,almost a 3 month friendship break,"long story short, my friends and i got into a fight back in November. this resulted in me getting basically ostracized from the friend group and my closest friend in the group told me they needed a break. that shit hurt but i was like ok i understand. they said for me not to contact them and when they’re ready to reconnect they’ll reach out to me. dope. well it’s been almost 3 months &amp; still heard nothing from them. im respecting their wishes by not reaching out first. i miss them and the group so damn much though. should i just assume at this point that they’ve broken up with me?"
relationship_advice,Depressed and hurt,"My boyfriend of 5 years finally told me that he's scared to death of getting married. It's mainly because of his ex stepmother who turned out to be a complete bitch after her and his dad got married. We've been living together for the past 2 years and it's been mostly great. I've shown him that I could be a good wife.

When my boyfriend told me that he doesn't want to get married because of what happened with his dad and ex stepmother, it broke my heart. He says that I might turn out like his ex stepmother. I told him that what he said hurt me and he didn't seem to care. He didn't even offer an apology.

Now I'm thinking about leaving him over this. It only hurts this much because I do love him. I've already got things figured out in case it does happen. What should I do?"
relationship_advice,Should I (22m) make a surprise to my ex gf (19) who is having difficult time and must pass a life changing exam,"TL;DR: I entered friendzone with my ex after one year of breakup. She is in love with another man who is ambiguous, and she is devastated. She's got a life changing exam tomorrow morning and I want to support her with a surprise appearance. I'm trying to fix a lot of errors from the past, in the case never being there. 

We broke up one year ago, not badly neither friendly, and lost contact. During this year I thought back to all the bad things I've done to her (very bad things, but only on a psychological level - no violence). I matured, I understood the errors I had done due to depression, and was literally eaten by sense of guilt.

So I decided to contact her to do the unthinkable: fix the pass. Did you watch My Name is Earl? Well that exactly what I'm doing right now. I got my 37 errors' list and I'm trying to fix them one by one. What does my ex think about this? She's encouraging me and is totally willing to help me with my sense of guilt, and I already fixed a couple of shitty things I had done. We are building the trusting friendship we had never had, and each day I feel a little bit better about me. I know what you'll say: you can't fix the past, go ahead. I couldn't go ahead because of my past, so I had to fix it. I already managed to fix other broken relationships in my past in a similar manner. It works, it's not only a dream.

But she's not interested in me as a partner anymore, cause she is completely in love with a guy whose intentions are not much clear. She confessed me her situation, asked for help, cried a lot. We were in the phone but all I wanted to do was run to her town and hug her. This is the typical friendzone. I don't care. We've never been friends, I want to show her that I am the person she can trust the more, the man she can confess everything, the one who will always try to make your world better. I still love her, but I know the door is closed, I don't expect anything. When we were together I didn't do anything for her, I was never beside her in difficult situations. I want to fix this.

Tomorrow she's got a life changing admission exam but she's destroyed by the fights with this new guy. I'm freaking scared that she loses control and gets everything wrong, and ends up crying on the sheet. She must pass the exam, it's fundamental. I'm scared for her and I want to show real support besides phone call. None is helping her a part of me. I think that fate is giving me the occasion for redemption. I don't do it as for expecting her to fall in love again with me, I know it's impossible. I do it because I feel it's the right thing to do. 

The exam is tomorrow early morning, I'm UE so it's deep night right now. I want to make her a surprise before the exam, give her a hug and a lucky charm related to the situation.

I don't know how she will react. Will she think I'm a stalker? Will she be embarrassed? Or feel like I'm pushing her? Or will she be happy and cheer up a bit for the exam? All I want is her to sit on the desk with the right mindset and pass the exam. What's the right thing to do in this situation?"
relationship_advice,I wanna ask my girlfriend to... Shave,"I'm not sure if I should be asking here, but I'll do it anyway.
 So I've [21M] been dating this girl for a while now. I love her, and I am definitely physically attracted to her (reason I approached her and all). We dated for about 5 months but then she moved for college. After a year that side, she came back and we started going out again, and again.

The thing is, before she left she used to take care of herself a lot. And please don't get me wrong, I still find her really attractive in every way possible. But lately it has bothered me a little bit that she doesn't... Shave (?). She has this tiny lil fuzz for a mustache that, to be honest, is hard to notice. It's not like an actual mustache haha. But I do know she didn't have it before. And I am afraid to ask her to shave. I don't even know if I should, if I have the ""right"". Or if I do, how to do it in a tactful way.
I'm kinda struggling cause when I'm close to her, that's all I can think of cause I can see it.
Am I just being exaggerated? Idk, I feel like a douche."
relationship_advice,Complicated relationship 😢,"I’ll start from the beginning, I met this guy through someone I knew. At the time I was already going through a phase of not caring about relationships random nsa hookups. This guy was different, I actually felt something and it was the first time I ever really felt something with anyone. Anyway we hooked up and I had no idea I had an std until I got tested, he got mad when I told him and I thought he didn’t want to see me anymore so I stopped talking to him. Had the std treated. Around 5 months ago I moved to a new place that happened to be closer to him (coincidence). We reconnected played around again. He mentioned that we might have to stop playing after he moves to a different neighborhood across town. I still had a crush on him and didn’t like that idea. So I made an offer for him to discreetly move in to my apartment quietly under management at a discounted rate only paying the internet and utility as rent. Things seemed to be going great and I was really happy with how things were. Until I found out he has a different side of him that is insecure. Some of my old fwbs kept trying to hit me up and I rejected every one of them. He didn’t like that and accused me of sneaking around even though I didn’t. When I was getting furniture for the place I got the “wrong color” and it looked “tacky”. He is really big on privacy and I misunderstood something he said thinking he wanted to play around again but then he got mad that I was invading his privacy. I even wanted to give him a hug before he went to work just now and he said I was invading privacy again. All of these moments have resulted in threats to move out. Including the “wrong color” furniture. I still like him and want this to work out. How can I make it work out?"
relationship_advice,Me (23/F) and my boyfriend (31/M) having a disagreement about threesomes... kinda?,"So earlier today I said to my boyfriend ""I wish I could be two places at once"" which made him say something along the lines of ""oh god if I could have two of you...."" 
I said ""no thanks, I'd be jealous of my own damn self"" 
Which he then stopped messaging me for 6 hours, only to come back and not say anything about our earlier conversation. 
So I asked why and he basically keeps saying ""I dont want to tell you my viewpoint because it's only going to upset you"" 
I'm telling him it's already upsetting he won't tell me, not to mention my brains just going through what he could want to say that he thinks would upset me so much. 
He keeps saying he doesn't know how to diffuse the situation and I'm telling him to speak his mind.

relationship_advice,I'm [33/m] Obsessing over my SO [26/f]. Could use some help,"Hello!

To begin, I'm a 33-year-old male. I've struggled with anxiety and some depression for most of my life. As a result, I've never been in a meaningful relationship until recently. I've dated a handful of times, but I'm currently in a long-distance relationship. 

Overall, things are going well but I've realized that I can't obsessing over my girlfriend and relationship. It's gotten to the point where I know it's not healthy for myself or the relationship itself. 

I can't stop thinking about her, but usually not in the best ways. When I don't hear from her in a while, I always think of the worst. Like that she's losing interest in me and going to leave me. Which when she calls me and we chat for hours is clear that isn't the case.

Is there any advice anyone that can give me?"
relationship_advice,"[UPDATE] I learned that I was a child of incest, and the shock really blew me over","[Update to this story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eothem/i_18m_just_learned_something_about_my_family_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Apologies for using a new account lost the password to the other one. So after two weeks I’m comfortable enough to share the aftermath of that bombshell. First off, I went to go see my campus councilor. Issue was, it was a she and I had difficulty getting into details of my feelings about the whole mess. She was really understanding and helpful and got me in contact with a friend of hers who does pro bono work. He’s been a real help.

I’ve told my new friends/roommates. While we had effectively just met days beforehand, they were willing to hear me out and offered their concerns.  We played games afterwards, which really got my mind off the matter.

I’ve also checked my financial matters as my family were the ones paying for most of my needs like food and all that. Turns out I’m in the market for a job so that’ll be fun /s. Better than relying on others tbh.

Lastly, I opened Pandora’s box and asked my mom (not my “dad”) why they decided to tell me NOW of all times. She had trouble giving me an explanation other than that she felt it was “the right time”. I can’t fathom what would constitute a “good time” to tell your kid that your the progeny off his biological older brother, but whatever. That was six days ago and I’ve not spoken to her since. I’ve decided not to tell my younger brothers, god knows I want to, out of respect for their ignorance. They’re wondering why I’m avoiding mom and “dad” and I just keep telling them that it’s a complicated matter and that it’s be better for them to ask again when they’re out of the house. Honestly, the whole situation is fucked up, but I’m pulling through. I won’t let it define me. I’m in college now and I’m off to make a life for myself. Thanks to those who offered their opinions and words of kindness, you’ve been wonderful."
relationship_advice,"My ex(19M) found out I(18F) slept with someone else after I broke up with him and went no contact. We could’ve still been great friends, can I fix this?","Context: I broke up with my ex because he broke my boundary and was generally immature/disrespectful. We talked about how it made me uncomfortable with him watching porn/fantasizing about sex with other girls/checking them out in front of me (which I never did to him vice versa). That was my difficult standard and I’d understand us breaking up over it, but he promised he’d stop. He continued doing it, I was super hurt so I broke up because that was the boundary we agreed on. He loved me but I could only love someone who was fully monogamous with me. 

While he wasn’t the best boyfriend we were great friends otherwise. I still wanted him in my life. After breaking up, we decided we’d keep hooking up for sexual needs, not emotional. Less than 12 hours after breaking up I got with a past partner because I was still hurting. The day after breaking up my ex and I were driving back to his house to hook up when he casually mentioned how I seemed tired. I slept late. He asked why. I told him. He dropped me off at our uni. 

What I did was for my pleasure, it was my right being single, but I still cared about him and he looked hurt so I called him asking to talk. He came back and told me to bring my phone. When I got into his car he went on it and started deleting all our texts, pictures, everything. Already blocked me on every social platform. He told me to delete his nudes but I held back because I wanted us to talk about this first. He was unresponsive while I explained the other guy was a rebound, I need comfort after he hurt me, and I didn’t owe anything to him after breaking up. I asked him why he was doing all this and he said he didn’t owe me an explanation. Told me he was never talking to me again. Told me if I didn’t get out of his car he’d take us to the police station... I left and slept with someone else but he doesn’t know. To clarify, rebounds seem impulsive and spiteful but that’s not me. That night I sent him a recording of me deleting the photos along with long texts about how irrational this all was, I was sorry to hurt him but wouldn’t apologize for my actions, although if I could take it back for his sake I would, we could’ve been friends. He replied that he didn’t hate me, he couldn’t be friends because he’s still attached relationship wise, and thought it was best to go separate ways. 
Analysis?? Did he think if we hooked up after I dumped him then eventually I’d forget his bad qualities and we’d get back together? Besides relationship problems he was a great person in my life. Knowing now that he still wants me, we can work on moving on and continue as friends. I really want that. Does time heal? Could he really be done? What can I do?"
relationship_advice,"Well, I guess I just need relationship advice. Am I over reacting??","Hi Reddit Users! 
I need some advice- 

I’ve been seeing someone for the past few months and I have my suspicions about this specific girl. 
I knew that they had been talking previous to us, but he said as “friends”. 
Okay cool, I don’t mind that he has friends that are girls. 
But, he decides to mention that on Twitter- she posted a thing selling her Nude Photo’s, and that he messaged her saying he’d buy them “as a joke”. 
Now, that I know he’s messaged her that- I’m not comfortable with them talking as clearly that’s on a more than friendly basis.

relationship_advice,I live with my assaulter please help,So I (f20) ended up living with my ex boyfriend and 4 other friends. I thought things would be ok because we agreed to be friends and it wasn’t always easy. But in recent months he has been sexually abusing me and saying that because I’m a liar and a cheater I deserve it. This went on for 3/4 months and was extremely traumatizing to me. I’ve learned since that he’s extremely manipulative making me believe that he hates all our roomates and I’m the only one he likes and I’m the only reason he’s living here (he isn’t in school and has no job). But I decided enough was enough and I tried to get help but he lied to all my roomates and despite me having a text confession of him saying that he laid is hands on me and threw me on the bed they don’t believe me. I am currently staying at a friends and putting my job and school on hold. I’ve reported to police and I’m meeting with a lawyer tomorrow but is there any way I can force him out of the house. Like any renting law or can I ask my landlord. Everything is extremely hard right now and I miss my bed so much.
relationship_advice,How do I [21M] not become resentful of my ex [22F]?,"Why is it so easy to get angry at your ex? For breaking up with me and hurting me like that (even though it was a clean, mature breakup). For small things like texting me in a friendly way and then not responding. And, this I recognize is all due to my own insecurity, for me causing myself to feel a little inferior by her waiting to have sex with me when I knew two other guys that she had slept with who she didn't wait for?

I know she is a good person, and that logically I shouldn't be upset with her, but my gut seems to want to be upset with her, and I have to try to broaden my perspective every time I find myself harboring any negative feelings towards her. I would consider it a moral failing to let these negative emotions manifest, especially to her, so the sooner I (and my gut) can see her as the decent person she is, the better.

Thanks in advance for the advice"
relationship_advice,I (28F) know my fiancé (40M) has downloaded pedo porn.,"He says it was just to see if he could do it, ie navigating and downloading from the awful places they have this stuff. I confronted him several times and he keeps telling me he’s not interested in underaged girls, but how do you download GBs of that kind of stuff and not be? I want to love him. I’ve ignored it and tried to make it work because he’s either gotten better at hiding or stopped it. Does it go away? These girls didn’t even have pubic hair. I’ve developed a drinking problem trying to escape the thoughts. Our sex life is all but non existent. I feel like a beard. He’s also cheated on me several times with transsexuals/cross dressers but again, not in the past couple of years (that I can prove). What the fuck does it mean?"
relationship_advice,A co-worker is spreading an embarrassing rumor about me [23/M]. How do I respond?,"Earlier this week, there was an incident where our employee restroom had to be closed off and thoroughly cleaned because someone went diarrhea and missed the toilet. I didn't witness the actual bathroom, but I overheard one of our bosses saying that it was a nightmare and she almost walked out of this job when she first saw it. It's been the talk of the town here at work and today it came to a head.

I was clocking in when I noticed a group of girls were giggling in my direction. They just walked past me while still laughing and I noticed throughout the day that other co-workers were giving me weird looks. One of them eventually came up to me and told me that someone was going around and saying that I was the one who made the mess in the bathroom. I found out that one of my former friends (we'll call him Adam) was the one who was spreading the rumor and I know exactly why.

A couple of weeks ago, I asked out a girl at work and this girl was someone whom Adam had liked for a while, but he never bothered to ask her out. I had asked him when he was going to finally ask her out, but he said that he had ""all the time in the world"" and he wasn't rushing to do it, so I asked her out since I also liked her. I've been going on a couple of dates with this girl, but I'm worried about her finding out about this rumor that Adam is spreading. She didn't work today, but I feel like she's eventually going to hear this lie. What do I do to preserve things with her? And how do I deal with Adam?"

I’m still trying to put the pieces back together with myself emotionally, not that I feel bad for myself I just overfall feel terrible for my SO. They didn’t deserve the things I did to them. They’ve been nothing but the perfect partner I could have ever asked for. Even afterwards they’ve been nothing but great and we have done a lot in our relationship to fix things. But I can never forgive myself for the things that I have done. Ever since I’ve been stuck and nothing even feels real anymore, I feel brain dead and like I’m on autopilot. I’m not making any progress emotionally and I feel like I’m holding my partner back. They are beautiful, outgoing, and has the biggest heart. I’m the reason they don’t feel the way they should about themself. I feel like if I left they would enjoy life to its fullest and get to know themselves better.

relationship_advice,"Is this relationship worth pursuing? Or am I just bored, delusional, and/or lying to myself? [18F]","Without being too specific, the guy I'm interested in is all sorts of unavailable. He's married, w/ kids, and an actor (though I should clarify that I actually /know/ him, we talk. It's not a celebrity-fan situation). I should note that even though he's an actor, we're in a situation where I can go to his theatre whenever and see him. 

I'm more or less in love (or infatuated) with him, but I have no clue if this is worth pursuing. I don't really have anything better to do otherwise (as sad as that sounds). He kisses me on the cheeks whenever we meet, and we have \*such\* good conversation. He gets kind of flirty, touchy, and always seems happy to see me. And at one point, he called me baby on social media and he likes/comments on /a lot/ of my posts. 

Although, I can't tell if he's interested or not. I'm reasonably attractive . I don't want to sound rude, but honestly far better looking than any of the other fans that he interacts with. BUT he follows them and not me. He's also dmed me a couple of times.

My boyfriend  works at a grocery store making $10/hr.

I'm a RN making $46/hr. I am set to start in a DNP program specializing in anesthesia; I will be a CRNA by 2025, at the age of 27.

My boyfriend is not depressed. I do not live with my boyfriend so he does not simply ""mooch"" off of me, nor do I have any plans of marrying him unless he improves his life; he swears up and down that he wants to be a better man, that he would like to do better things with his life, but year in and year out there is no improvement.

He started off this relationship 5 years ago by filling me up with hope towards the future; infact THAT hope is what has gotten me this far; I've wanted to be a woman who was worthy of him and his time.

Today, he told me that he is no longer wanting to go to college to become a police officer because they aren't allowed to wear earrings. He's kicking a career to the curb because of some guages. I have plenty of piercings that I remove before I go to work, so I don't understand the deal.

relationship_advice,How is a relationship with a single mom who has college-age kids?,"It's a hypothetical question and I want to get some feedback from people.

Suppose that I am a man who is 30, living in the US. What would be the pros and cons of marrying a single mom (in her 40s) who has college-age kids? If you think it's a disaster and I have to run away, tell me why.

If the kids were off to college, how could they influence our relationship? I have no problem with their occasional visits, even if it is long term. I do not want to be financially responsible for the kids though.

What would it be like to live with this type of woman? Considering that she's independent and employed.

How much is this scenario better than marrying a woman who is closer age wise (in her 30s) but she has younger kids (8 to 18 years old).

By the way, I have absolutely no interest in having biological children of my own if that matters.

Just in the past week, we got reacquainted with each other after years of not acknowledging each other's existence. I'm unsettled and continue trying to find anyone else in the room that's remotely attracted to me. 

  


  


  


The party ends abruptly. I didn't find anyone to dance with. Then my drunk dumbass texts her after the party to hang out in my dorm. She responses with ""Hiiii"" and swiftly obliges to my request. She arrives and we turn on stranger things. About 10 minutes into the second episode, I lean in to kiss her. She dodges it and I stumble to the side of my bed. I then accidentally grab her to catch my balance. I tried to let go after I recuperated myself but she wouldn't let me go. She started caressing my forearm. I'm so confused and asked why she avoided my kiss. She told me that she doesn't want to kiss me when I'm drunk. Somewhere along the lines that I'm not fully aware of my actions and she wants to kiss me when I have the full mental capacity to make out.

He still does it and then apologizes when I express anger. I look good physically and have undergone surgery to fix the things on my body he has commented on. I’m basically exactly what he wanted me to be. So why does he still stare and comment on other women. I’m not naive.

I lost my mom in 2016, downward spiral for me (I don't drink or do drugs, I was severely depressed though), and I didn't give my husband affection. It was worse after we lost a baby due to an advanced ectopic pregnancy. He would ask me to cuddle, and I'd say ""no, I'm touched out from the kids"" or ""cuddling makes me sweat"". We had sex a lot, but he said it felt like i wasn't interested... And he wasn't wrong, but it wasn't because of him. He tried so hard and I was blind because I was in my head. He opened up to me and told me my distance pushed him away. He lost his dad last year and needed me, but I was in my head. He said he doesn't know what he wants anymore, but is willing to give me a chance to be the woman he married again after we had some difficult conversations, but is still going to go talk to legal to see what it'll be like if we don't end up reconnecting. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst type of thing. I've gotten a referral for therapy for myself to overcome my moms death, and am making sure I'm doing all the things he wished I was previously, so I'm trying very hard to fix my mistakes. Please someone give me hope, he's my best friend and I really messed up with that dark cloud that followed me around. Sad thing is I didn't even realize it until I lost him, but I'm taking baby steps to get him back. I just need encouragement. I'm scared of losing him forever. If you're depressed, please get help. Don't be like me and go through it by yourself, I should've gotten help years ago and maybe I wouldn't be in this situation."
relationship_advice,Help!! My husband went too far in an argument and I cannot mentally deal with him,"My husband 33m is a notorious stonewaller. We got in an argument yesterday and he instantly ran away and then started his usual process of stonewalling me. I 33f have been dumped on so many times this week regards to difference stresses and I reached my boiling point. I called him out on it and it turned into a bigger argument because he is in denial about it. I've mentioned this to my therapist and she agrees this is classic stonewalling but his reason for using it is more due to a lack of emotional security.  He flipped everything around... Deflected it all and made it about me having cptsd and projecting onto him. I don't stone wall. I always try to remedy the argument sooner then later as it triggers panic attack for me in the past.  He attacked my emotional well being in a cruel way and I told him that I can't be bothered to try to communicate anymore with him. I feel sick.  What he said was really low and it really hurt.  Now I'm in the bath reading a Gottman book as per my counselor wondering how to not come off as a stonewaller as well.  I just don't want to speak to him at all. I'm hurt and still very mad.  If he talks to me I'll respond of course but this argument is off limits. He texted me to say he will stay in his room since I'm so ""scared"" of him. I am scared of him because of the conflict he brings. He makes no attempt to lessen it and I'm exhausted.  How do you say you've hurt me and I don't want to talk to you but it's not the same as stonewalling.
