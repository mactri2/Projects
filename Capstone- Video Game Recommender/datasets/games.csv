Ransome left his luxury penthouse and hastened through Solomons Habitation Tower to try to impede Wey-Yu as much as possible; he disabled the camera systems, sealed the window shutters of the outside of the station and deleted all server records. All whilst under the duress of the Drone and numerous Facehuggers that had made their way into the area. 
 
After surviving the Xenomorph encounter in Habitation, Ransome moved onto his next goal in the San Cristobal Medical Facility; remove all trace of his involvement. Whilst the Xenomorph stalks him in the facility, he steals numerous copies of Dr. Lingard's research files and also deletes a message that Lingard had sent to Marshal Waits regarding Ransome (a list of all the times he blackmailed or threatened someone). An explosion later engulfs an area of the facility, with the executive taking his leave in an elevator to comms. Ransome also manages to save a resident from a burning room during this experience. 
 
The elevator crashes into comms, with Ransome having to climb out of it. Once investigating around the Working Joe stricken area, he closes a message recorded by Nina Taylor to Sevastopol and takes an audio log recorded by Ellen Ripley in hopes of using it as a bargaining chip to get on-board the Torrens. Whilst experiencing a close encounter with the Drone, Ransome managed to override elevator security control and escape.

They figure that the Alien is using the ducts inside the ship to move around, and Dallas suggests leading the Alien to the main airlock. The player then gets to decide if Ripley, Parker or Dallas goes into the ducts. The player grabs a flamethrower, motion tracker, Maintenance Jack and possibly a flare and Medikit. They then meet with Ash, who tells them that the security systems has shut a number of doors, so they'll have to gather equipment en route. The player descends a ladder to B Deck, and Ash seals the hatch behind them. 
 
While avoiding being killed by the Alien, the player seals maintenance hatches 00B1 and 00B2. They then pass through the landing claw bay, where Brett's corpse is located, and seal either hatch 00B3 or 00B4. After sealing the hatch, Ash tells them to find the primary air shaft system, and lead the Alien to C Deck. There, Ash can connect to the airlock systems from his terminal. After entering the primary air shafts, the player's motion tracker begins malfunctioning. Lambert finds the player on her motion tracker and tells them that the Alien is also inside the shafts. Lambert attempts to guide the player through the shafts while they avoid the Alien. Eventually, the player reaches the end of the shafts and drops down to C Deck. 
 
The player then has to connect Ash to the airlock systems. Ash tells them that he's opening the outer airlock, but it'll take some time, so they should find somewhere to hide. Eventually, Ash informs them that it's primed, and instructs the player to wait for the Alien to enter the outer airlock chamber and be ready to close it in. Once the Alien enters the airlock, the player approaches the airlock and presses the button to seal the airlock. However, Ash tells them that something strange is happening, and the switch does not work. An alarm inside the airlock activates, and the Alien flees, knocking out the player. Once they wake up, Ash is waiting for them. 
 
It ends with a shot of the med lab, as Ash's voice is heard delivering his iconic monologue from the movie: ""Bring back lifeform. Priority one. All other priorities rescinded. You still don't understand what you're dealing with do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. I admire its purity. A survivor. Unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality. Last word. I can't lie to you about your chances. But... you have my sympathies.""","This additional content sees the original crew reunited aboard the Nostromo. Brett and Kane are dead; alongside Ash and Lambert, it is now down to you as Dallas, Parker or Ellen Ripley, to find a way to isolate the Alien and overcome the terror that confronts them. 
 
Alien: Isolation is a first-person survival horror game capturing the fear and tension evoked by Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic film. Players find themselves in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger as an unpredictable, ruthless Xenomorph is stalking and killing deep in the shadows. Underpowered and underprepared, you must scavenge resources, improvise solutions and use your wits, not just to succeed in your mission, but to simply stay alive.","[18, 19, 21, 268435487]","[18, 19, 21]",75.15283829662536,6.0,1580947200,https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-isolation-crew-expendable,[12380],"[106478, 106479, 106480, 106481, 106482, 106483, 106484, 106485]",85.30567659325071,5.0,,,,,,,,,

However, Waits' lead was proven to be false as the Drone was in fact revealed to be in Prisoner Processing with Ricardo still in it. Ricardo before reaching an elevator, managed to collect numerous prisoner tags from deceased inmates on the way, collect the visitor registry data and lockdown the area's armory. 
 
Waits informs Ricardo about Gardiner, a fellow marshal who was supposed to have delivered a package, was not checking in. The elevator stops at Seegson Synthetics with Ricardo exploring the area. The area is filled with corpses, with the one closest to the package presumably being Gardiner. The ""package"" is revealed to be explosives, with Waits intending to use them against the Alien. Ricardo takes them from a table and leaves for the elevator, but not before finding a private message sent from Nina Taylor to Waits regarding the flight recorder. The elevator is revealed to be dysfunctional, with Ricardo being forced to turn the power back on for it to work.

Ricardo reaches the area, the Alien having followed him. Under the duress of the Drone, Ricardo manages to send a conformation message to Waits to update the marshal on his progress and activate an evac alarm, encouraging all remaining survivors within the quarters to flee the area.
