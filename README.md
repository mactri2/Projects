# Projects

Welcome to my collection of Data Science projects and exercises.

My journey into Data Science has been full of learning experiences and I continue to improve and climb higher. Perfection is impossible but growing is not.

If you asked me years ago, I say I never imagined being a Data Scientist.

The time and effort going into the three month program rewarded me with the most essential and toughest experience of my life. It felt like time stopped and the 480 hour timeframe felt like an eternity.

Exploratory Data Analysis, modeling, and machine learning are a few skills I embraced.

Machine learning has been a game changer because it takes automation to another level with less programmer input and more computer output utilizing algorithms and data. It’s what created the spam filter in our email systems.

If I had a choice between my college education and GA, GA is a no brainer because I gained job specific skills and experience working on various projects and presentations.

Everyday I felt like quitting and giving up because the curriculum and tight deadlines was unbearable and maybe I wasn’t good enough. Pushing through, I’m glad I didn’t.

Being positive and hopeful made me a capable data scientist.
